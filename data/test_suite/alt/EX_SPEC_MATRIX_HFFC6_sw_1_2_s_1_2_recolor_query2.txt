Figure with two charts. Top track is a matrix.  The genome is shown on both the x- and y-axes. Both axes show intervals. The expression values are encoded using color intensity.    Bottom track is a bar chart.  The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The color of the bars indicates the different categories.
