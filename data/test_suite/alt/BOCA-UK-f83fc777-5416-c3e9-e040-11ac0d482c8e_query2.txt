Figure with 15 individual charts. Briefly, these are a ideogram and chart with left and right triangles, a chart with text, 6 different charts with vertical lines, a genomic range annotation track with text, a scatter plot, 4 different charts with rectangles and a chart with connections, horizontal and vertical lines and left and right triangles.Ideogram and chart with left and right triangles. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The color of the rectangles, right triangles and left triangles indicates the different categories.  Chart with text. The genome is shown on the x-axis.  The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the text is black. Chart with vertical lines. The genome is shown on the x-axis.
