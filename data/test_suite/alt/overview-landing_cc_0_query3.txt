Figure with 4 individual charts. Briefly, these are 2 different bar charts, a line chart and scatter plot and a heat map.Bar chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The color of the bars indicates the different categories.  Line chart and scatter plot. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines and points. The height of the expression values is shown with the size-axis. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the lines and points.  Heat map. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression values are encoded using color intensity. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories.  Bar chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the bars.
