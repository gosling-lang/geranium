Figure with 8 individual charts. Briefly, these are a circular ideogram, a circular chart with text, 5 different circular charts with rectangles and a circular chart with connections.Circular ideogram. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The color of the rectangles indicates the different categories.  The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Circular chart with text. The genome is shown on the x-axis.  The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the text is black. Circular chart with rectangles. The genome is shown on the x-axis.   The color of the rectangles is lightgray. Circular chart with rectangles. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.   The color of the rectangles is sky blue. Circular chart with rectangles. The genome is shown on the x-axis.   The color of the rectangles is lightgray. Circular chart with rectangles. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.   The color of the rectangles is dark orange. Circular chart with rectangles. The genome is shown on the x-axis.   The color of the rectangles is lightgray. Circular chart with connections. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The categories are shown with the color and stroke of the connections.
