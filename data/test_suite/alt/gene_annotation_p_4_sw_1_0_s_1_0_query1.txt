Figure with 3 individual charts. Briefly, these are 2 different genomic range annotation track with texts and a genomic range annotation track with text and chart with rectangles.Genomic range annotation track with text. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the right triangles, text, left triangles, rectangles, lines and lines.  Genomic range annotation track with text and chart with rectangles.
