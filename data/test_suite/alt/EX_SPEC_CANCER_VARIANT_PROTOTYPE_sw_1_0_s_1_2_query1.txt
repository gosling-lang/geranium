Figure with 11 individual charts. Briefly, these are a circular ideogram, a circular chart with text and triangles, 2 different circular charts with rectangles, a circular chart with connections, a ideogram and chart with text and left and right triangles, a chart with text, a genomic range annotation track with text, 2 different charts with rectangles and a chart with connections and points.Circular ideogram. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The color of the rectangles indicates the different categories.  The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Circular chart with text and triangles. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.   The color of the text and triangles is black. Circular chart with rectangles. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.   The color of the rectangles is dark orange. The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Circular chart with rectangles. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.   The color of the rectangles is green. The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Circular chart with connections. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The categories are shown with the color and stroke of the connections.  Ideogram and chart with text and left and right triangles. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The color of the rectangles indicates the different categories. The color of the right triangles indicates the different categories. The color of the left triangles indicates the different categories. The color of the text indicates the different categories.  Chart with text. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.   The color of the text is black. Genomic range annotation track with text. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the right triangles, text, left triangles, rectangles, lines and lines.  The x and y-axes have brushes, linking to one of the other charts.
