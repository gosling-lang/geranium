Figure with 11 individual charts. Briefly, these are 7 different bar charts, a genomic range annotation track with text and chart with rectangles and 3 different charts with connections.Bar chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars.  The color of the bars is pink. Bar chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis.

The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the text, text, rectangles, rectangles, rectangles and lines.  Chart with connections. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The height of the connections indicates the different categories. The color of the connections is none. Chart with connections.
