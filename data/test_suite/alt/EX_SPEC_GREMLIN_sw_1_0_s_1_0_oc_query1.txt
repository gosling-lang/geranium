Figure with 3 individual charts. Briefly, these are a ideogram and chart with rectangles and text, a ideogram and a chart with connections.Ideogram and chart with rectangles and text. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The color of the rectangles indicates the different categories. The color of the rectangles is pink. The color of the text is black. The color of the text is black. The x-axis has a brush, linking to one of the other charts. Ideogram. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color and stroke of the rectangles.  The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Chart with connections. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.    The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart.
