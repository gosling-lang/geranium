Figure with 3 individual charts. Briefly, these are 2 different genomic range annotation track with texts and a genomic range annotation track.Genomic range annotation track with text. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the text is black. The color of the right triangles is gray. The color of the left triangles is gray. The color of the rectangles is lightgray. The color of the lines is gray. The color of the rectangles is purple.
