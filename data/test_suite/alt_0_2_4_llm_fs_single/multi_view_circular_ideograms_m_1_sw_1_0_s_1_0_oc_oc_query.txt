A circular chart with a central radius of 0.6 displays genomic data using two tracks. The outer track is a circular line chart showing the expression of genomic features on the y-axis for chromosome 1. Different colors represent four categories, labeled 'sample 1' through 'sample 4.' The inner track is a circular ideogram indicating chromosomal intervals with colored rectangles, indicating different categories of chromosomal staining. The ideogram uses a filtered data transform to exclude certain stains. The entire visualization maps data to the hg38 assembly, with the circular layout providing an integrative view of genomic patterns across specified domains.
