The visualization is a linear bar and text chart that displays genomic data using a multivec file format. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis shows count values expressed through colored bars. Each bar's color corresponds to one of four nucleotide bases: A, T, G, or C, with a legend provided for clarity. Overlapping text annotations depict bases directly on the chart, styled boldly in white for visibility. Interactive features include text visibility adjustments based on zoom level and bar width. The overall layout is linear and horizontal, measuring 1152 pixels in width and 96 pixels in height, and it effectively encodes quantitative genomic data with categorical coloring and annotations.
