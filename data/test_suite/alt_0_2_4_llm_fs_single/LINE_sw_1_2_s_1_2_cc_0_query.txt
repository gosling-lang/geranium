A linear line chart visualizes a multivec dataset, showing genomic data across the entire hg38 assembly. The x-axis represents genomic positions across various chromosomes, while the y-axis displays quantitative peak values. The line, representing expression values, is styled in pink and has a consistent thickness. The visualization is static, measuring 1152 pixels in width and 246 pixels in height. The dataset is categorized under 'sample 1,' with data fetched from a specified multivec URL. The track utilizes a zoom limit feature to explore the data range dynamically.
