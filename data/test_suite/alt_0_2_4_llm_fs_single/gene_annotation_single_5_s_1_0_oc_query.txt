The visualization is a linear genomic range annotation track displaying data from chromosome 3, spanning from 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. The layout has a horizontal arrangement and features gene annotations divided into multiple categories: genes, exons, and introns. Each category is represented by differently colored rectangles: genes in gray, exons in red, and introns in light blue. The data is stratified by strand, with two rows for positive and negative strands. The data source is a BEDDB file accessible via a URL, detailing genomic positions and value fields such as strand and gene names. The visualization provides clear genomic intervals on the x-axis and maintains styling elements like strokes for better readability. The dimensions are 350 by 130 pixels.
