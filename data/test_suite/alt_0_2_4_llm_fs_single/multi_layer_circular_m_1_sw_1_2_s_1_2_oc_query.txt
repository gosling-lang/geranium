A circular visualization displays multiple time series data across chromosome 12, ranging from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The layout is organized in six concentric bands, each band representing incremental layers of quantitative data with varying opacity levels. The visualization employs line marks to depict genomic data points, stratified by rows corresponding to different samples, and colored by categories, with 16 distinct samples excluding a specific "sample -." The chart is dense, with grid lines marked at the bottom axis, enhancing readability of peaks. The reference to Javed et al.'s study on graphical perception underlines its inspiration for representing data in a circular format.
