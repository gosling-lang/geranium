The visualization is a linear layout with a vertical arrangement of two tracks, displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning 1 to 2,000,000 base pairs. Both tracks use BED files for data representation. The top track visualizes genomic intervals with black rectangular marks, using columns 7 and 8 for positioning. The bottom track similarly uses black rectangles for chromosomal positions defined by start and end fields. Each rectangle has a fixed height of 10 pixels and a black stroke with a 1-pixel width, maintaining consistency across both tracks.
