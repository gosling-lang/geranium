A linear layout visualization depicts genomic data using "withinLink" arcs to represent connections within chromosome 1. The arcs are generated from a CSV file sourced via a URL, defining genomic intervals with fields "s1", "e1", "s2", and "e2" on the x-axis. The arcs are styled with a consistent stroke color of light red (#fc8585), creating a pattern illustrating linked genomic segments across the chromosome. The visualization spans 960 pixels in width and 246 pixels in height, set against the human reference genome hg38.
