The visualization is a circular bar chart using vector data to display genomic information. This chart depicts the entire genome (hg38 assembly) arranged circularly, with the positions on the genome mapped along the circumference (x-axis) and their respective peak values represented by the height of the bars on the y-axis. The bars, colored in green, highlight quantitative variations in the genomic data. The circular layout is static with a spacing of 1 and a center radius of 0.3, giving a clear radial view of the genomic data. The visualization spans a width and height of 588 units, with the bar chart aligned in a stacked manner. The data source is linked through a URL to a vector tileset, which is integral to rendering the peaks across the genome.
