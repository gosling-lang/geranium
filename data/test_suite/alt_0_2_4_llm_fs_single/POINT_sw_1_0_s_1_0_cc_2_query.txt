A scatter plot in a linear layout visualizes multivec data aligned with the hg38 genome assembly. It displays the entire genome along the x-axis with genomic positions labeled by chromosome. Each point's y-position and size are determined by the 'peak' value, representing expression levels. The points are consistently colored light purple (#b59bf2). The visualization spans 800 pixels in width and 210 pixels in height, offering an interactive view of genomic data with zoomable and pannable features.
