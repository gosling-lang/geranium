A vertically arranged linear bar chart visualizes a multivec file, highlighting chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 of the hg38 assembly. Each row represents a different sample, with bars colored according to the sample id ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'). The x-axis shows genomic positions with a top axis, while the y-axis shows quantitative values (peak heights). This visualization effectively stratifies data by rows, with four distinct color-coded samples, and provides interactive tooltips for detailed genomic and sample information.
