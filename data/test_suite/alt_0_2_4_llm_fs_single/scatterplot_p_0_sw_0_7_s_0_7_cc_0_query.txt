A linear layout visualizes a multivec file focusing on chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The data points represent genomic positions on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis. Each point's size correlates with the peak value, and colors differentiate between four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The chart features a grid for the y-axis, and the points have a semi-transparent opacity. Tooltips provide detailed information on genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample categories.
