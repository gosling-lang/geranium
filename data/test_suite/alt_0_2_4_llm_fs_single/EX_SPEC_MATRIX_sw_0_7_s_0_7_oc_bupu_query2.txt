This visualization displays a genomic dataset with a linear layout overlaid with multiple tracks. It includes a matrix that plots the genome on both the x- and y-axes, with shading indicating expression values. Blue strokes annotate horizontal genomic positions. Another bar chart overlays data points, categorically colored with varied intensity, indicating chromosome data. A scatterplot encodes point size based on quantitative values, shown across genomic intervals on both the x- and y-axes, with a color scheme of steelblue. This visualization uses the hg38 assembly, covering a range between 800,000,000 and 1,600,000,000. The style includes dashed lines for visual emphasis.
