The visualization is a linear layout featuring an overlaid chart depicting genomic data on the hg38 assembly. It includes three tracks. 

1. The first track is a green bar chart illustrating the "peak" values across the genome with varying heights, representing quantitative differences with a domain range of 0 to 0.003.
2. The second track overlays horizontal and vertical pink lines, representing quantitative values mapped along both the y-axis and stroke width, based on JSON data values. 
3. The third track overlays vertical sky-blue lines, emphasizing fixed genomic positions with a stroke width of 2, using the same JSON data set.

A dashed style interconnects these elements, offering a cohesive visual design. The chart interacts with the genome by revealing data linked to specified genomic fields and values.
