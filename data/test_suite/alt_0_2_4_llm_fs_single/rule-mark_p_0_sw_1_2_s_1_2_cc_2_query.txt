The visualization features a linear layout showcasing genomic data from a multivec file. It includes three overlaid tracks: a bar chart displaying genomic intervals in pink, representing expression values; horizontal and vertical lines plotted with purple lines, encoding additional quantitative data; and vertical lines in green, highlighting specific genomic positions. The genomic data spans several chromosomes, labeled on the x-axis, with expression values depicted on the y-axis. The layout is enhanced with dashed line styling for emphasis and visual separation between different data elements.
