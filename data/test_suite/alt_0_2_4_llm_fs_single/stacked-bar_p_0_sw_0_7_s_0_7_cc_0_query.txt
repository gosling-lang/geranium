The visualization is a linear bar chart displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. Each bar represents a 'peak' value, quantified along the y-axis, with genomic positions on the x-axis. Categories 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4' are shown in blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. Bars are used to depict four samples, with colors differentiating among them. Tooltips provide additional data for start and end positions, peak values, and sample identification. The layout is a vertical arrangement with a center radius of 0.8, and the data is sourced from a multivec file hosted on a remote server.
