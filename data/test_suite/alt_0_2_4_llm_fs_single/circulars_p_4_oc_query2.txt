This visualization features a circular arrangement displaying four distinct tracks, each focusing on data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The first two tracks are circular scatter plots representing expression values with point size and color differentiating four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The third track uses a circular area chart to illustrate the same genomic data, stratified by sample with colors corresponding to each category. The fourth track shows a circular connection map visualizing linkages between genomic intervals, with the color of the connections representing categorical data associated with genomic positions. Each track includes interactive tooltips detailing start and end positions, peak values, and categorical samples. The visualization is static, designed to emphasize the genomic data's complex relationships with clear, color-coded representations.
