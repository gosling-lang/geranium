This visualization consists of three tracks arranged vertically, all focusing on chromosome 3 within the interval 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. Each track is a genomic range annotation with gene names displayed as text. The tracks are colored based on the strand orientation, with blue representing the '+' strand and red representing the '-' strand. Triangular markers at gene ends indicate directionality, while rectangles denote exons. The first track uses larger text and markers for emphasis, the second track employs smaller annotations for a compact view, and the third track uses navy colors for a distinct visual style.
