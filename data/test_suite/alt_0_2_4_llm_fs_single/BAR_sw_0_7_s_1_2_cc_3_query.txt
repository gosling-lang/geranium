The visualization is a linear bar chart depicting genomic data from the hg38 assembly. It displays intervals across various chromosomes on the x-axis, with expression levels mapped on the y-axis using green bars. The chart visualizes data from a multivec file, focused on a specific category labeled "sample 1." Each bar's height corresponds to the quantitative data field "peak," and the color is uniformly green, represented by the hex code #85B348. The layout is non-static, allowing for zooming, and is horizontally oriented with specified dimensions for clear data representation. The chart effectively illustrates genomic peaks across chromosome positions.
