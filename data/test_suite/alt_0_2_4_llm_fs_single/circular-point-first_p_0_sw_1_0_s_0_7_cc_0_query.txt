A circular scatter plot visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The expression values are represented by points, varying in size based on a field named 'peak.' The plot is stratified by four categories: 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4,' each displayed in distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The opacity of the points is set to 0.5, allowing for visual layering. Tooltip interactions provide genomic start and end positions, along with the respective sample data. The chart uses a vertical arrangement for its circular layout and maintains a static view of the genomic range.
