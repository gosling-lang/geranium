The visualization is a scatter plot arranged in a vertical layout, focusing on the genomic region of chromosome 6 between positions 160,000,000 and 200,000,000. It features a linear view with four tracks, each corresponding to different samples labeled 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'. Each track uses the 'peak' value to plot data points. The x-axis represents genomic positions while the y-axis shows quantitative values. Points are color-coded based on the sample category, allowing for clear differentiation across the samples. The layout is designed for easy comparison, enhancing the interpretability of genomic data across multiple categories.
