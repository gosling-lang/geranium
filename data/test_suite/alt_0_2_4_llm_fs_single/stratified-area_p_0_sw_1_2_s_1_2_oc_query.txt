The visualization is an area chart in a linear layout, displaying multivec data across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. This chart stratifies data into three rows based on categories 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' and 'sample 3.' Each category is represented by a distinct color, with sample 1 in orange, sample 2 in green, and sample 3 in blue. The x-axis shows genomic positions, while the y-axis displays quantitative 'peak' values. The chart includes tooltip functionality to provide genomic start and end positions, as well as peak values and sample names, enabling interactive data exploration.
