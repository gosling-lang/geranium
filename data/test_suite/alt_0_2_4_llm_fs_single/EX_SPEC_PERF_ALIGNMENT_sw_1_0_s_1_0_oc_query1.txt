The visual representation displays genomic sequences using a linear layout, focused on an interval from positions 350 to 396. Each row is associated with a unique sample name, showing colorful rectangles that indicate different nucleotide bases. The color variation symbolizes distinct base categories, with a black overlay used for text annotations when zoomed in. The visualization combines rectangles and text annotations, with no visible x-axis labels. The text size and visibility are influenced by zoom level, ensuring information detail corresponds to user interaction. The detailed color range includes shades such as red, green, blue, and purple, allowing differentiation between nucleotide bases. The dataset utilizes a CSV file format containing fields for genomic positions, aligned in rows based on nominal sample names, to represent DNA sequence alignment visually.
