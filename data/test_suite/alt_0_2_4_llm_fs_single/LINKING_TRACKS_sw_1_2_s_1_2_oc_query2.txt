This visualization consists of two horizontally aligned charts displaying genomic data from a multivec file on chromosome 2. The top track is a line chart, differentiating two samples (sample 1 and sample 4) with distinct colors. Each line represents expression values (peaks) over genomic positions. The second track is an area chart for sample 1, using color to indicate expression intensity. Both tracks encode genomic position on the x-axis and quantitative expression on the y-axis. The plots enable comparison across samples and display variations in data with a consistent linear layout.
