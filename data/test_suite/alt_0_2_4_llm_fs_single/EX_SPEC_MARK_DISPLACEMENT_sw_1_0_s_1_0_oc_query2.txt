The visualization displays a combination of genomic annotation and variant analysis in a linear layout. It comprises two main views: one focused on chromosome 2, and the other on chromosome 17. The first view includes a track showing genomic positions annotated as "Likely benign" variants with green points, connected by links. Nucleotide bases are displayed as colored text, and orientation arrows indicate gene directions. Below, the second view highlights variant significance on chromosome 17 using a color-coded point track, representing categories like "Pathogenic" (pink) and "Likely benign" (green). The interactive design enables detailed examination of genomic regions, utilizing data from clinvar and gene annotations.
