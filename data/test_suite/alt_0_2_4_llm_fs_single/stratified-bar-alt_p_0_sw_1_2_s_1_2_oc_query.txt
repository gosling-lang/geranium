The visualization is a linear bar chart with a vertical arrangement, illustrating genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500 on the hg38 assembly. The chart is divided into four rows, each representing different samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Bars encode the minimum and maximum peak values for specific genomic intervals, with color differentiation for each sample. A black stroke outlines the bars. The x-axis displays genomic positions with an upper axis label, and the y-axis represents peak values. The data source is a multivec file, and the tooltips provide genomic positions and peak values with two-decimal precision.
