The visualization displays a bar chart with a linear layout, covering chromosome 12 from positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. It illustrates a multivec file with samples labeled from 'sample 1' to 'sample 16', filtering out specific undesired samples. Each bar represents genomic intervals, with the y-axis displaying quantitative peak values. The data is stratified into rows by sample categories, with each category represented by distinct colors. The chart has responsive height adjustments based on visibility settings and highlights a reference in graphical perception.
