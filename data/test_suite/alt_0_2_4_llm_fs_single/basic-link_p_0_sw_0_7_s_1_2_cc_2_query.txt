The visualization is a linear layout chart displaying connections within chromosome 1, utilizing a withinLink mark type. The data is sourced from a CSV file containing genomic fields 's1', 'e1', 's2', and 'e2'. The connections are visualized through arcs, using start and end positions within the chromosome as defined by genomic fields. The arcs are colored in green (#85B348), providing a distinct visual representation of the genomic links on chromosome 1. The chart configuration includes an interactive domain constrained to chromosome 1, enhancing focus on this specific genomic region.
