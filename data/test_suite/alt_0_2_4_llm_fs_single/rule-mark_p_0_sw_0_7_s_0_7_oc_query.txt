The visualization is a linear layout showcasing genomic data using a bar chart overlaid with rule markings. The primary track is a light gray bar chart representing "sample 1" data from a multivec file. The genomic intervals are plotted on the x-axis, while expression values are shown on the y-axis within a 0 to 0.003 domain. Overlaid on the bar chart are two additional rule tracks: one with red lines indicating vertical expression thresholds and the other with blue dashed lines as baseline markers. The visualization emphasizes genomic positions with data-driven stroke widths for the rules, assigned to specific chromosome positions, enhancing the chart's interpretative depth.
