A horizontal layout features views of chromosome 7 from 77,700,000 to 81,000,000. It includes bar charts representing genomic data such as H3K4me3, ATAC-seq, and CTCF binding, encoded with dark green, orange, and navy blue colors respectively. Genomic annotation tracks display strand information as pink and green triangles for '+' and '-' strands. Two large heatmaps in shades of orange visualize interaction matrices, illustrating genomic interactions. Additionally, multivec data shows various chromatin states through colored bar charts, highlighting categories like active TSS and enhancers.
