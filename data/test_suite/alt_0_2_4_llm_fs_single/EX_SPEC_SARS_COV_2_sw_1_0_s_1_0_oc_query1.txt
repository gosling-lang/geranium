A linear layout visualizes gene annotations of the NC_045512.2 genome, spanning positions 1 to 29,903. The chart includes rectangles colored navy blue representing genomic intervals, with white vertical lines styled as right triangles indicating specific points. Gene symbols are displayed in black text, overlaid on the genomic intervals, linked to a separate chart via an interactive brush. The visual encoding uses diverse styling, including a white stroke around rectangles and text for clarity. This visualization provides an overview of the gene structure within the specified genome segment.
