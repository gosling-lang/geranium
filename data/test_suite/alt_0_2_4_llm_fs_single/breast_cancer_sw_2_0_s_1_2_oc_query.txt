A linear genomic visualization showcases gene annotations and copy number variations on chromosome 1. The top track features a gene annotation with strands represented by rightward and leftward facing triangles; blue for positive and beige for negative strands. The two lower tracks depict copy number variations derived from a CSV file. The middle track highlights regions with no minor copy number in the tumor, using orange rectangles. The bottom track presents regions with a total copy number in the tumor between 4.5 and 900, using green rectangles. The visualization uses color to distinguish strands and variations, with chromosomes shown along the x-axis.
