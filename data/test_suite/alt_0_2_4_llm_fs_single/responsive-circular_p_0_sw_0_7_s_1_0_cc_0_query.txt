A circular bar chart visualizing multiple time series data on chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart, structured in rows for different samples, employs bars colored according to categories. The expression levels are shown along the y-axis. It adapts responsively, switching to a linear layout for aspect ratios above 1.5. The color scheme spans multiple shades, and data intervals are depicted with varying opacity depending on the chart height.
