A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The chart consists of multiple concentric rows, each representing a sample. Samples include 'sample 1' through 'sample 16' (excluding 'sample -'). The bars display quantitative values related to genomic peaks, with different opacities for distinct domains. Each sample is color-coded, though no legend is provided. The layout is circular with an axis at the top, showcasing a genomic overview with adjusted transparency levels across different peak ranges. The reference for this visualization is Javed et al.'s work on graphical perception of multiple time series.
