This visualization overlays a genomic matrix with multiple annotation tracks, leveraging the hg38 assembly. The main matrix is displayed on both x- and y-axes indicating genomic intervals, with expression values represented through color intensity on a grey scale. Superimposed are three additional tracks: red vertical lines, blue horizontal lines, and points overlaid with genomic positions on both axes. The points vary in size, correlating to a quantitative field, and are colored steel blue with a white stroke, exhibiting semi-transparency to highlight overlaps and densities in data. Highlighted annotations mark specific chromosomes like chr2, chr5, and chr10. This layout is linear, with a unified interval from 800,000,000 to 1,500,000,000 base pairs, providing a dense yet detailed genomic data representation.
