The visualization is a linear chart displaying within-connection links across chromosome 1 of assembly hg38. The connections are drawn with arcs that indicate genomic intervals, sourced from a CSV file located at a specified URL. The arcs, representing linked genomic positions, are colored in light purple. The x-axis is aligned with chromosome 1, allowing for genomic comparisons within this chromosome. Each arc connects pairs of intervals, with positions marked by start and end fields. This representation provides a visual overview of genetic linkages or interactions within the chromosome, using a simple, horizontal format.
