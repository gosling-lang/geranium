The visualization features a hybrid layout combining circular and linear views, depicting genomic data from the human genome assembly hg19. It consists of a circular view and a linked linear view, arranged one above the other. The circular view illustrates an ideogram with chromosome bands colored according to staining characteristics, overlaid with annotations including gene labels and structural variations. The linkage is highlighted by arcs representing various structural variation classes such as tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions, each encoded with distinct colors.

In the linear view, the ideogram is expanded to show specific details of chromosome 1, with gene structures including exons and introns displayed. This view provides a zoomed-in representation of genomic features, using annotations and brush interactions for further exploration. The tracks within the linear view present copy number variations, emphasizing loss (dark orange) and gain (green) events. Additionally, semi-transparent link arcs connect corresponding genomic regions in the circular and linear views, enhancing data exploration and interpretation.

Interactivity is facilitated by brushing techniques that allow detailed exploration across linked tracks, providing a comprehensive view of genomic rearrangements.
