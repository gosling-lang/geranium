A linear scatter plot visualizes a multivec file for the hg38 genome assembly. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis indicates quantitative 'peak' values. Each point's size on the plot corresponds to its 'peak' value, with all points displayed in pink. The layout spans a width of 392 pixels and a height of 156 pixels, capturing the expression of 'sample 1' across the genome.
