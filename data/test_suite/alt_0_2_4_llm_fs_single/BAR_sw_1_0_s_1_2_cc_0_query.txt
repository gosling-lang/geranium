A linear bar chart visualizes a multivec file across the entire genome of hg38. The chart displays genomic intervals on the x-axis and quantitative expression values on the y-axis. The bars are colored pink, with a size value of 5. The data derives from a URL, representing category "sample 1" with a bin size of 10. The layout is horizontal, and interactive zoom limits are available. Width is set to 960, and height to 246.
