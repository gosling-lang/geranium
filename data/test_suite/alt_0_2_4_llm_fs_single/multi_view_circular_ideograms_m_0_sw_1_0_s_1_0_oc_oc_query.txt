This visualization is a circular chart featuring two tracks plotted around the chromosome 1 domain. The outer track is a circular scatter plot that represents genomic data using multivec format, where the position on the circular axis encodes the genomic location (chromosome 1), and the y-axis encodes the 'peak' values, which are marked by points. The color of each point indicates different categories of 'sample' (sample 1 to sample 4), with each category visually distinguished by a nominal color scheme.

Inside this, thereâ€™s a circular ideogram, which visually represents the structural features of chromosome 1. This track uses a CSV dataset and depicts different chromosomal regions. The x-axis of this plot represents genomic intervals, and the color of the rectangles corresponds to various chromosomal 'Stain' types, with colors ranging from white to black and different shades of gray and blue, visually encoding categories like 'gneg', 'gpos' variations, 'gvar', etc.

Both tracks are aligned in a circular layout with a specified center radius, facilitating an integrated genomic visualization that allows for efficient comparison of structural features and quantitative data. The interactive nature of the visualization makes it suitable for detailed genomic data analysis.
