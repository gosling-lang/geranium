A linear visualization overlaying multiple tracks represents genomic data from a multivec file of the hg38 assembly. The x-axis displays genomic intervals, while the y-axis shows quantitative values for 'peak'. The first track is a bar chart with sky blue bars and a peak value range from 0 to 0.003. Overlaid are vertical green rules, based on JSON data, indicating genomic positions with varying stroke widths representing different quantitative values. Additional sky blue vertical lines highlight specific genomic locations. The overall styling includes a dashed line pattern.
