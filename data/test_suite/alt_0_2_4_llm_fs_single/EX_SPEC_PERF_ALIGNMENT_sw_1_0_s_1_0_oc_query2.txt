The visualization is a linear alignment view showing genomic data from a CSV file representing the positions of elements within defined intervals. The layout consists of rectangles and text annotations, arranged in a horizontal manner with intervals on the x-axis from 300 to 396. The alignment is stratified by categories denoted as rows, each represented in distinct colors. The color coding corresponds to nominal data fields, visibly highlighted with a palette ranging from vibrant red to blue, orange, and green, among others. The black text overlays on the graphical elements when zoomed in, revealing individual bases within the genomic sequence. While the overall assembly remains unspecified, the chart is interactive, featuring stretching capabilities for enhanced visualization with a focus on flexibility in display across different zoom levels.
