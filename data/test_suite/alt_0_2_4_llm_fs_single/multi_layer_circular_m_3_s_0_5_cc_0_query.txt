A circular bar chart visualizes genomic data from chromosome 12, ranging between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart consists of multiple concentric rings, each representing a different sample, numbered from 'sample 1' to 'sample 7' with the exception of 'sample -', which is filtered out. Bars are colored using a nominal scale with shades of blue, orange, green, red, purple, brown, and pink denoting different categories. The height of the bars indicates quantitative expression values of genomic peaks. The layout is non-static, allowing zoom interactions over this genomic region, encoded within a circular track format with an outer radius of 200 units.
