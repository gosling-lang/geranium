A circular scatter plot visualizes a multivec file, displaying chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The plot includes points colored by sample, with opacity varying across concentric rings to represent different peak value domains. Each ring corresponds to a quantitative domain of peak values and is labeled accordingly. The circular layout allows for a compact visualization of genomic data across multiple samples, effectively illustrating the distribution of expression values.
