The visualization is a linear bar chart using multivec data, displaying genomic information from the hg38 assembly. The chart measures 500 pixels by 200 pixels and is arranged horizontally. It consists of three overlaid tracks, each with unique data encodings. The primary track is a bar chart showing genomic intervals on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis. The bars are colored in purple and represent data from a file with a bin size of 8. Two additional tracks display horizontal rules: the first shows lines based on quantitative values with variable stroke widths and colored in green, while the second displays sky blue lines with a fixed stroke width. The visualization features a dashed line style and spans expressions from 0 to 0.003 on the y-axis.
