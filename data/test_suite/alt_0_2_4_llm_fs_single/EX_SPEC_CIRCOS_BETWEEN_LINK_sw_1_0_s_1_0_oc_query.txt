A circular visualization depicting genomic data from the hg38 assembly. The outermost track is a bar chart, displaying genomic intervals with light gray bars representing expression levels. Two circular ideograms show chromosome bands with color-coded categories based on staining properties. Light gray links between chromosomal positions indicate segmental duplications, with darker links highlighting specific chromosomes. The layout is in a stacked, circular arrangement with a focus on integrating multiple genomic data types. The visualization facilitates the examination of genomic features such as gene density and segmental duplications.
