A linear visualization of chromosome 1 spanning from 1 to 2,000,000 shows two tracks. In both tracks, genomic intervals are represented as sky blue rectangles with black outlines, emphasizing coding regions. Each rectangle's size is set to 10, and this visual uses BED files for data representation. The top track marks genomic positions using fields 'col7' and 'col8' from the BED file, while the bottom track marks these positions using 'chromStart' and 'chromEnd'. Both tracks maintain a consistent aesthetic with a stroke width of 1 pixel.
