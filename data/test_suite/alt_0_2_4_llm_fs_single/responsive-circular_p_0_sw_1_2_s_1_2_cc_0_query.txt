A circular multi-row bar chart visualizes genomic data from chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart displays multiple rows representing samples, each colored differently: blue, orange, green, red, purple, brown, among others. The layout is adaptive, shifting between circular and linear formats depending on the aspect ratio. The height of bars in each row indicates quantitative expression values, while colors represent categorical data fields named 'sample.' The visualization utilizes a data file fetched from a URL, processed with filtering and binning transformations. This chart is referenced from the study "Graphical perception of Multiple Time Series" by Javed et al., TVCG 2010.
