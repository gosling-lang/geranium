The visualization is a linear genomic range annotation track focusing on chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. It features multiple layers: text annotations, rectangles, and rules representing gene strands. The texts and rectangles are colored navy, while the rules indicating gene strands have white lines overlaid with triangular patterns to show directionality. The chart is stratified by strand into rows labeled "+" and "-", visualizing gene structures with arrows pointing right for "+" strands and left for "-" strands, highlighting the genomic interval visually and textually.
