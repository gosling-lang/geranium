A linear layout visualization displays a genomic range on chromosome 1 between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. The visualization includes five tracks, featuring duplication and connection patterns. The top and bottom tracks show genomic segments as rectangles, with blue and pink colors respectively, indicating different regions. The second and fourth tracks use green and pink shades to represent connections between genomic intervals within the specified range. Each track utilizes data from a CSV file with genomic fields like start and end positions, and the connections are defined by line marks termed "betweenLink." The visualization emphasizes the relationships and duplications between genomic regions using subtle color variations and transparency settings.
