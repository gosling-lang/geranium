The visualization is an overlaid chart consisting of multiple tracks with a genomic alignment focus, presenting three main components. The first track uses rectangles, showing genomic positions as rows stratified by categories represented through various colors. The second track is a bar chart illustrating conservation values, with bars colored according to quantitative conservation data. The third track represents gap values in a bar chart format, with bars displayed in gray. The entire view spans a genomic x-domain from 0 to 396, with a focus interval between 350 and 396 for zooming. The chart utilizes CSV data from external sources and features a brush tool for interactive selection, set against a light gray background.
