The circular area chart visualizes genomic data from chromosome 12, covering the interval from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000 base pairs. It features seven categories, each represented by distinct colors in concentric rows. The data is derived from a multivec file, filtered to exclude a specific category. The x-axis portrays genomic intervals, while the y-axis shows quantitative expressions with areas, and the chart is stratified by rows to differentiate categories. The visualization uses the assembly hg38 and arranges the data in a circular layout, efficiently utilizing space and providing a clear, layered representation of the genomic information.
