A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file, depicting chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The chart consists of multiple layers, each representing a different sample category with distinct colors. The height of the bars is linked to the "peak" values in the data, and the chart adapts to changes in aspect ratio. The visualization includes a legend that displays the sample categories. This setup allows for a dynamic examination of genomic intervals, providing insights into variations across multiple samples.
