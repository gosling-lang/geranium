The visualization depicts a matrix heat map in a linear layout, representing genomic interaction data from a matrix file. The assembly used is hg38, and the x- and y-axes both display genomic intervals ranging from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000. Color intensity encodes quantitative expression values, shown in shades of grey. The main diagonal and some off-diagonal regions reveal interaction patterns. The chart dimensions are 630x630 pixels. The visualization is static, with no zoom capabilities, designed to provide an overview of genomic interactions across specified chromosome ranges.
