The provided visualization is an area chart arranged vertically, showing genomic data across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500, using a linear layout. The data is visualized from a multivec file with four samplesâ€”'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is stratified into rows and represented by different colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis shows quantitative peak values. The chart is enhanced with tooltips that display detailed genomic and quantitative information, and each area is outlined with a thin white stroke.
