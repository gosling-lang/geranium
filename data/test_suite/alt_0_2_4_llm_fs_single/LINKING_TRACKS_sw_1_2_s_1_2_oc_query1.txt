The visualization consists of two horizontal tracks in a linear layout, presenting genomic data from chromosome 2. The top track features a line chart, displaying genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative values on the y-axis, with data from samples 3 and 4. Colors differentiate the lines for each sample, with a white stroke outlining them. The bottom track is an area chart, similarly mapping genomic positions against quantitative values. This track visualizes data from samples 1 and 2, with areas colored to represent each sample. The charts are stratified by rows to further differentiate between samples, enhancing comparison across different genomic regions.
