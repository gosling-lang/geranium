A vertical arrangement of tracks displays genomic data for chromosome 13 between positions 32,000,000 and 32,700,000. The top track is a gene annotation track depicting genes, exons, and strand information using colored triangles and rectangles. The strands are represented by orange and blue colors, while text labels indicate gene names. The middle track consists of ClinVar data, visualized with a combination of bars and points. Bars are shaded in light gray, while points are colored according to seven categories of significance, such as 'Pathogenic,' 'Likely_benign,' and others, supported by a color legend.
