A multi-row bar chart in a linear layout represents a multivec file. It shows segments of chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The chart has four rows, each representing a different sample ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'). Each row contains bars representing 'peak' values in quantitative terms. Bars are colored differently for each sample using blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis represents expression values. Tooltips display additional quantitative information, including start and end genomic positions. The assembly used is hg38.
