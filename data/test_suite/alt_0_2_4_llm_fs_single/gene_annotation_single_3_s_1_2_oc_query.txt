The visualization presents a linear layout of a gene annotation track for chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. It displays genes as arrows, with blue indicating the positive strand and red the negative strand. Exons are shown as rectangles, while directional lines with triangular patterns represent the gene's transcription direction. Gene names are positioned above or below their respective arrows. The layout is arranged horizontally, with the chart stratified by rows for the positive and negative strands.
