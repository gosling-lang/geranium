The visualization features a circular layout with a vertical arrangement showcasing genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. It comprises two horizontally arranged views, each containing two tracks. One view includes a circular bar chart and a circular heatmap with categories stratified by rows, colored in blue, orange, green, and red. The heatmap encodes expression values with color intensity. The second view presents a circular line chart and scatter plot along with a circular bar chart. The line chart and scatter plot display expression values on the y-axis using lines and points, with point sizes representing height. The final bar chart uses color to distinguish between categories, illustrating genomic data with bars. All charts are interactive, with tooltips providing genomic positions and sample information.
