The visualization is a vertical arrangement featuring a linear chart depicting a multivec file for the genomic region on chromosome 1 between positions 3,000,000 and 3,000,010. It overlays bars and text tracks. The bars on the y-axis represent counts of nucleotide bases (A, T, G), with each base colored distinctly as per a nominal scale. Text markers display the base letters within genomic intervals, in bold white font, appearing only when conditions on width and zoom level are satisfied. The view is horizontally oriented, configurable for zoom and pan, and includes a legend indicating base categories.
