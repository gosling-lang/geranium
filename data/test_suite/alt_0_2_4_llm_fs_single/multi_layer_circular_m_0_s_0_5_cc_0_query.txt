A circular scatter plot visualizes a multivec file of chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. Multiple rows are used to represent samples, displaying data points in different colors: blue for 'sample 1', orange for 'sample 2', green for 'sample 3', red for 'sample 6', purple for 'sample 7'. Data points are plotted based on their genomic positions (x-axis) and peak values (y-axis).
