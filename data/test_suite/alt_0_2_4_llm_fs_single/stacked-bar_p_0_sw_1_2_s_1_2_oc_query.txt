A vertical bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, displaying genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The chart encodes quantitative peak values along the y-axis and genomic positions along the x-axis. Four categories, labeled 'sample 1' to 'sample 4,' are represented by different colors of the bars. Tooltips provide additional information, including start and end genomic positions, peak values, and sample names. The chart is 864 pixels wide and 156 pixels high, and features grid lines for easy data interpretation.
