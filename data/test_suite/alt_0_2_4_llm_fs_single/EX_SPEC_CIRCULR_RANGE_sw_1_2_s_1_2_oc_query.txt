A circular bar chart visualizes a vector file in a stacked layout, using the hg38 genome assembly. The circular layout spans the entire genome, with genomic positions represented on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis. Bars are colored in a light yellow shade (#EEEDA1). This static visualization maintains a minimum center radius of 0.3 and features an inner radius approximately 151 units, with an outer radius extending to about 504 units.
