The visualization is a linear line chart displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, between intervals 200,000,000 and 220,000,000. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis depicts quantitative values from a data field named 'peak.' The background is styled in a light steel blue with 10% opacity. This chart uses a multivec file from a single category, 'sample 1,' sourced online, and features a linkable interaction identified by 'linking-with-brush.' The chart's dimensions are 960 by 230 pixels, designed to visualize the assembly hg38.
