A linear ideogram depicts the human genome, using data from the UCSC.HG38.Human.CytoBandIdeogram dataset. The x-axis displays genomic intervals from chromStart to chromEnd across different chromosomes. Each chromosome is represented by rectangles color-coded according to stain types, with colors such as gray, black, and white indicating different cyto-banding. Text labels indicating chromosome names are displayed alongside. Triangles at segment ends indicate acen regions on the q and p arms, marked in maroon. The ideogram's layout allows zooming interactions to reveal or conceal certain details based on width thresholds.
