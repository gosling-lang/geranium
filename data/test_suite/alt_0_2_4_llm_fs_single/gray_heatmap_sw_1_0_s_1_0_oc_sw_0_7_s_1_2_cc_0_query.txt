A linear heat map visualization displays a genomic interaction matrix from hg38 assembly. It covers the full genome range from chromosome 1 position 0 to chromosome Y position 57,227,415. The chart uses color intensity from a warm palette to represent quantitative interaction values. Tracks are static, with intervals marked on both x- and y-axes, highlighting genomic positions with corresponding interaction frequencies. The title is absent, but it visually encodes data through rectangular marks, facilitating an understanding of complex genomic relationships.
