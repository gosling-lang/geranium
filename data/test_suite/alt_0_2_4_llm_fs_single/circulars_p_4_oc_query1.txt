A circular visualization displays genomic data across four tracks, focused on chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The layout features two horizontal views arranged vertically. The first view includes a circular heat map where color intensity encodes expression values, stratified by categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'. Adjacent is a circular bar chart illustrating genomic positions with bars colored by category, displaying expression on the y-axis. The second view shows another circular bar chart with a grid, again encoding expression data by category. Accompanying this is a composite track with overlaid line and scatter plots, where lines and points represent expression values, with point size reflecting intensity. Tooltip interactivity provides specific genomic positions, expression values, and sample classifications, enhancing the data exploration experience.
