A linear visualization composed of two stacked bar tracks displays genomic data from chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 2,000,000. Both tracks, utilizing BED files, represent genomic intervals with black-outlined rectangles of fixed height. The top track visualizes data from a BED12 file, while the bottom track uses a BED6 file. Featuring a simple layout with black strokes of width 1, this chart offers a straightforward representation of genomic positions, assisting in visual comparisons between different datasets.
