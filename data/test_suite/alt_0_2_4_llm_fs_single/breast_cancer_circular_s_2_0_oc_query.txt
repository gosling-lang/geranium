The visualization is a circular ideogram paired with two circular range annotation tracks. The outermost track represents the entire genome (hg38 assembly), color-coded by chromosomal bands: ranging from white for "gneg" to dark red for "acen." The first inner track highlights genomic regions with a minor copy number ("minor_cn_tumor") of zero in tumors, depicted in dark orange rectangles. The second track visualizes regions with a high total copy number ("total_cn_tumor") in tumors, displayed as green rectangles, filtered to show values ranging from 4.5 to 900. This comprehensive circular layout allows simultaneous exploration of chromosomal structure and copy number variations in tumor data.
