A linear area chart visualizes a multivec file displaying genomic data from the hg38 assembly. The x-axis represents genomic positions across multiple chromosomes, while the y-axis shows quantitative expression values named 'peak.' The chart's continuous yellow area indicates varying expression levels across the genome, corresponding to 'sample 1.' The layout spans 560 pixels in width and 156 pixels in height, with areas proportionally scaled to a size of 2.
