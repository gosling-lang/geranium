The visualization is a horizontally arranged linear layout depicting gene annotations on chromosome 3, ranging from 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. The top chart is a genomic range annotation track featuring gene names, aligned according to genomic positions. It uses blue right-pointing triangles for positive strands and red left-pointing triangles for negative strands, with exons marked as gray rectangles. The bottom chart highlights genomic regions with rectangles colored in gray (genes), red (exons), and light blue (introns), stratified by strand orientation. Both charts provide a detailed visual representation of gene structures, facilitating genomic analysis.
