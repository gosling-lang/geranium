The visualization consists of five parallel track views, each displaying data for chromosomes 1 to 5 in a linear layout. Each track comprises two layers: an area chart and an ideogram with annotations. The area chart shows 'peak' values for 'samples 1-3' with varying colors representing each sample. The ideogram illustrates genomic intervals with rectangles and triangles, using color to denote categories (e.g., rectangles in gradient shades indicating density and maroon triangles marking certain genomic segments). The charts are organized horizontally for a comparative view across chromosomes.
