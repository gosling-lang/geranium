A visualization with two aligned views depicts genomic data from chromosome 1 using multivec data. On the left, a circular bar chart shows the genome with expression values represented as bars, stratified into four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each category is distinguishable by color: blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis intervals have a brush for linking to the linear view.

The right view is a linear bar chart showing genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values as bars on the y-axis, similarly categorized and color-coded. The bars allow comparative analysis across samples. The brush is used interactively to link this chart with the circular view. The layout, combining circular and linear orientations, provides a comprehensive genomic overview.
