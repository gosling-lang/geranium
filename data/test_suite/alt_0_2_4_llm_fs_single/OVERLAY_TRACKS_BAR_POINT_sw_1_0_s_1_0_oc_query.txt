The visualization is a linear chart displaying genetic variant data along chromosome 3 using a BED file format. Bars and points represent the "significance" of each variant, with seven categories ranging from "Pathogenic" to "Benign." These categories are color-coded: pathogenic variants in orange, uncertain significance in black, and benign variants in green. The y-axis is categorical, showing different levels of significance, while the x-axis displays genomic positions. Bars are overlaid with points where the stroke of bars and color of points correspond to the variant categories. The chart effectively illustrates the distribution and type of genetic variants along the chromosome.
