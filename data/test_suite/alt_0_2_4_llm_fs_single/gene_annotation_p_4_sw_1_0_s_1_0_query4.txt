The visualization consists of two horizontally arranged genomic range annotation tracks focused on chromosome 3, between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The top track displays gene annotations, with genes on the positive strand shown with rightward blue triangles and those on the negative strand with leftward red triangles. The exons within genes are represented with rectangles, while gene names are displayed inside the track. The bottom track similarly shows gene annotations but uses thicker, opaque navy blue rectangles and text for gene visibility. Both tracks highlight the genomic intervals through gene alignments using directional rules and distinctive color patterns, enhancing strand differentiation.
