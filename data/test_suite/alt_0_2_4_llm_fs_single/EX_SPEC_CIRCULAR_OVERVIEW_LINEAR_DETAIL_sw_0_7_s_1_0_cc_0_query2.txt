A horizonal arrangement of two vertical stacked bar charts displays data from a multivec file, depicting genomic intervals on chromosomes 5 and 16. Each chart represents four samples, with expression values shown on the y-axis and genomic positions on the x-axis. The samples are color-coded: sample 1 in blue, sample 2 in orange, sample 3 in green, and sample 4 in red. The left chart has a blue background while the right chart has a red background. These charts allow for a detailed comparison of expression levels across different genomic positions and samples.
