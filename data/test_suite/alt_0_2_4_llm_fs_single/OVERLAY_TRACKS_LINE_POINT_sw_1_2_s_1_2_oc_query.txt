This linear layout visualization displays genomic data from a multivec file for chromosome 1, between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The chart is stratified by four samples ('sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' 'sample 4'), each represented on separate rows. Each sample row features a combination of line and point marks indicating expression peaks. The size of the points corresponds to the expression values, ranging from 0 to 6, and the colors designate distinct samples.
