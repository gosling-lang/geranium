The visualization is a linear, vertically arranged chart using multivec data to display genomic information from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. It includes four tracks, each representing a different sample labeled 'sample 1' to 'sample 4,' colored in blue, orange, green, and red respectively. The x-axis shows the genomic position, while the y-axis represents the quantitative 'peak' value. Each track displays data as both lines and points, with the size of the points corresponding to peak values. The visualization uses a tooltip for detailed information about the genomic position, peak value, and sample category.
