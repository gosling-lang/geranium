A bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, showing genomic intervals along the x-axis, with the assembly hg38. The expression values, represented by bars on the y-axis, utilize data from a field named 'peak.' The bars are sized at a fixed value of 5. The chart is centered around a genomic representation of the dataset titled 'sample 1,' with data sourced from "https://resgen.io/api/v1/tileset_info/?d=UvVPeLHuRDiYA3qwFlm7xQ." The chart measures 560 units in width and 156 units in height, illustrating genomic data with an interval bin size of 5.
