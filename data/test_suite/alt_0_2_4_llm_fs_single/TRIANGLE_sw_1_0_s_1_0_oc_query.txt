A linear genomic annotation track visualizes gene orientation across several chromosomes. Right-facing blue triangles represent genes on the positive strand, while left-facing red triangles represent genes on the negative strand. The track is organized by strand, using colors to differentiate between the two categories, with blue indicating the positive strand and red indicating the negative strand. Each triangle's position corresponds to genomic start or end positions, providing an overview of gene distribution along the genome. The visualization includes interactive elements, such as opacity settings, to enhance visibility.
