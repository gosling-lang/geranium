A circular visualization presents genomic data for chromosome 1 using two tracks. The first track is an area chart that encodes expression levels as peaks along the y-axis, categorized by 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' and 'sample 3,' each represented in different colors. The x-axis displays genomic positions, conveying data from a multivec file. The second track shows a circular ideogram derived from a CSV file, displaying genomic intervals with varied staining patterns. The layout employs a center radius of 0.6, creating a concentric arrangement where the area chart encircles the ideogram, allowing simultaneous inspection of expression levels and chromosome structure.
