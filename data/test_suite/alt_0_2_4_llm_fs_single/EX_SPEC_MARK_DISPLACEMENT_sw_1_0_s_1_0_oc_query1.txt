### Description

This genomic visualization presents a linear arrangement focusing on chromosome 3 between the coordinates 142,500,000 and 143,000,000. The visualization is an overlay of multiple tracks displaying gene annotations from a BEDDB file. The genes are represented with directional arrows indicating their transcription direction, colored blue for the positive strand and orange for the negative strand, mapped to the color domain with hex codes `#0072B2` and `#D45E00`, respectively. The track layout accommodates up to 15 rows of piled annotations to effectively visualize overlapping regions.

Text labels next to the arrows provide gene names, positioned at an offset above the genomic axis. Exons are depicted as rectangles, while the introns are visualized as lines with arrowheads, aligned according to the strand orientation. Each track includes additional geometric marks: triangles at gene ends to indicate strand directionality, and a repeating triangular pattern within lines to denote exons.

Opacity for all marks is set to 0.8, enhancing visual clarity without overwhelming. Arrows and other markers are outlined in black to provide contrast against the faint background outline.

A specific genetic region on chromosome 17 serves as the reference xDomain context. This visualization leverages interactive and dynamic filtering, adapting to the viewing scale with conditions for displaying detailed annotations, determined by the width of visual components against specified thresholds.

The design prioritizes clarity in genetic contexts, making it a valuable tool for genomic research and analysis by visually communicating complex data
