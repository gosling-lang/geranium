The visualization is a horizontal genomic range annotation track focusing on chromosome 3, spanning positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. It displays gene annotations using text, right triangles for forward strands, left triangles for reverse strands, rectangles for exons, and connecting lines for entire genes. The genomic positions are represented on the x-axis, stratified by strand direction. Positive strands are colored blue, and negative strands are colored red. This provides a clear view of gene distributions and exon positions within the specified genomic interval.
