The visualization presents a circular heat map of genomic data from chromosome 1, covering the interval from 1 to 3,000,500. It uses a multivec file to display expression values as color intensities, with darker colors indicating higher values. The layout is circular and vertical, with data stratified by rows representing four categories: 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' Each category is arranged horizontally, displaying genomic positions using rectangle marks. The map is static with a center radius of 0.5, and the color encoding uses a 'hot' range without a visible legend.
