A responsive multi-layer bar chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. Bars are stratified across multiple tracks by 16 different samples, using unique colors for each. The data for each layer is filtered to exclude a specific sample ('sample -'). The y-axis represents varying ranges of 'peak' values, providing multiple levels of detail based on the chart's height. The x-axis displays the genomic start and end positions. This chart effectively illustrates multiple time series across genomic intervals, as referenced by Javed et al. in TVCG 2010.
