A linear visualization of chromosome 12 shows a genomic range annotation track and three bar charts. The genomic track represents gene annotations with right and left triangles for strand directions, text labels, and rectangles for exons, all colored in pink. The region spans from 10,140,000 to 10,200,000 base pairs. The three bar charts illustrate quantitative data from three vector datasets, using pink bars to indicate expression levels, overlaying the genomic coordinates below. The layout is vertically arranged, maintaining a cohesive alignment linked by position on the genome.
