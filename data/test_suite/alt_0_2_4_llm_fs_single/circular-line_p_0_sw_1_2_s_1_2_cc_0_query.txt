A circular visualization represents a multivec file, showing the chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500 in a circular arrangement. The visualization includes overlaid tracks with lines and points, where both are colored based on categories 'sample 1', 'sample 2', and 'sample 3', represented in blue, orange, and green, respectively. The size of the points is proportionate to the 'peak' value, providing a quantitative representation. The x-axis encodes genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative peak values. The visualization is static and provides detailed tooltips for user interaction, indicating the position, peak value, and sample category for each data point. The chart employs a vertical arrangement within the circular layout, enhancing categorical separation.
