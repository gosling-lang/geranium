A linear line chart visualizes a multivec dataset, displaying chromosome 1 from the hg38 assembly. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis illustrates quantitative peak values. Green lines trace the expression data along the genomic coordinates. An interactive brush, colored in steel blue, overlays the chart, linking it to another visualization for enhanced exploration. The chart dimensions are 960x270 pixels.
