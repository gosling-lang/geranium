A linear heat map displays genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The data visualizes four samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4') as rows. Color intensity represents quantitative expression values from the multivec file, with darker shades indicating lower values and brighter shades indicating higher values. The x-axis is segmented to show genomic intervals, while a color legend on the right aids in interpreting the expression values.
