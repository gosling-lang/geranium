The circular bar chart visualizes genomic data from a vector file in a circular layout. It highlights various chromosomes, with positions encoded on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis. The bars, representing expression levels, are colored in pink, creating a radial pattern. The data is based on the hg38 assembly, and the layout is static, ensuring a consistent view. The visualization spans a width and height of approximately 343 pixels, with a center radius of 0.3, providing a compact yet detailed representation.
