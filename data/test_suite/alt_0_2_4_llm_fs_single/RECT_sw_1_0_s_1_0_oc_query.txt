The visualization is a linear ideogram of the human genome assembly hg38, displaying chromosome 1. It uses a rectangular mark to represent various chromosome bands, where the color of each rectangle indicates different staining categories. These categories, such as "gneg," "gpos25," and others, are shown using colors like white, light gray, and various shades of black and gray. The ideogram is styled with a gray stroke, and the genomic position is represented on the x-axis, showing intervals for chromosome 1. The visualization is interactive and flexible for zoom adjustments, facilitating detailed genomic exploration.
