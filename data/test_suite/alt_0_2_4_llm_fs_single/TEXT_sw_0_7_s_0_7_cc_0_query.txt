The visualization is a linear genomic text chart based on the hg38 assembly. It displays genomic intervals on the x-axis and quantitative expressions on the y-axis, represented by colored text. The data is sourced from a multivec file, categorizing different bases—A, T, G, and C—each assigned a distinct color palette: blue for A, orange for T, green for G, and red for C. The layout style focuses on expression values without stroke width for text, and the visuals stretch across the plot, providing a clear representation of base counts over specified genomic regions.
