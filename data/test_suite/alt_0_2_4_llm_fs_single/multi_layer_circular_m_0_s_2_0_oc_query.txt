A circular visualization shows a multivec file, displaying data from chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The data is represented as points in a circular format, with categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 8' differentiated by color. The points' positions are based on a 'peak' value, covering a quantitative range of 0 to 0.01. This visual stratification allows distinct comparison across multiple categories by color-coding them. The circular design highlights genomic data intervals along its x-axis, emphasizing patterns across different samples.
