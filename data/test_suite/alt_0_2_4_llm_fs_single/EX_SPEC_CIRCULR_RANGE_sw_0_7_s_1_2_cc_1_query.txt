The visualization is a circular bar chart in a stacked alignment, utilizing a vector file to represent genomic data from the hg38 assembly. The chart displays chromosomal positions on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis. Bars are colored in sky blue, with the layout centered around a circular space. The outer layout has a radius of approximately 294 units, while the inner layout measures around 88 units in radius. The visualization is static, with no interactive components, and the bars span the entire genome, arranged horizontally around the circular format. The chart's width and height are approximately 588 units, creating a consistent circular shape that fully encodes the genomic information.
