The visualization is a circular area chart displaying multivec data across chromosome 12 from position 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. It features stratified rows representing different samples, each colored distinctly to visualize data peaks, with categories ranging from 'sample 1' to 'sample 16.' The chart efficiently illustrates variance in peak data across specified genomic intervals using layered opacity for different value domains, allowing insights into expression patterns. This circular layout captures a comprehensive view of multiple time series data as referenced in Javed et al.'s 2010 study on graphical perception.
