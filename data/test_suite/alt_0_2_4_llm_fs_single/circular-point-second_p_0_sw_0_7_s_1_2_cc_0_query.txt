A circular scatter plot in a vertical arrangement visualizes genomic data from chromosome 1, showing the region between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The plot uses a multivec file to display data from four samples, with points representing expression values. Each point's size and position corresponds to a quantitative data field named 'peak.' The points are color-coded to indicate different samples, using a palette of distinct colors including blue, orange, green, and red. The plot is static with a central radius, and the axes are shown, providing additional insight into genomic positions and expression values. Tooltips offer detailed information for specific data points.
