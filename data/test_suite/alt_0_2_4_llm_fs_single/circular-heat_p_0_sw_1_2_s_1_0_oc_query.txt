A circular heat map visualizes genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The data, sourced from a multivec file, is stratified into four rows, representing different samples. Each radial section corresponds to genomic positions, with color intensity encoding the expression values of the 'peak' data field. The heat map features a vertical arrangement with color gradients to indicate the magnitude of values, aiding in the differentiation of expression levels across genomic intervals.
