The visualization consists of two circular charts in a vertical arrangement. The top circular chart displays genomic data as a multivec file, with bars indicating expression values along the y-axis. The bars are stratified by four categories—'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'—each marked by different colors. Interactive brushes in blue and red are applied on the x and y-axes, linking to other charts.

The bottom chart is a circular connection chart depicting genomic rearrangements. Genomic intervals on the x-axis are connected by lines, representing different types of rearrangements such as 'deletion', 'inversion', 'translocation', and 'tandem-duplication'. The categories are differentiated by stroke color. Both charts are stacked, with data filtered to show specific chromosomes ('1', '16', '14', '9', '6', '5', '3'), and feature overlapping tracks with a semi-transparent aesthetic for the connections.
