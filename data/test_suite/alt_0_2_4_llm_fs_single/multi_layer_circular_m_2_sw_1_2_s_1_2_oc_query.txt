This circular area chart visualizes a multivec file focusing on chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. It features multiple samples arranged radially, represented by different colors. Each sample's peak expression value is displayed as an area, with transparency indicating different value ranges. The chart supports interaction through dynamic opacity changes, helping to reveal patterns and trends in genomic data effectively. This visualization is inspired by Javed et al.'s study on graphical perception of multiple time series.
