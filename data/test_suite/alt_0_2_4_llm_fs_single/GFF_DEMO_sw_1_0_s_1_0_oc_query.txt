The visualization is a linear layout of genomic data from the E. coli MG1655 genome, specifically highlighting the region from positions 222,000 to 240,000. It uses data from a GFF file, depicting various gene biotypes such as 'protein_coding', 'tRNA', 'rRNA', among others. The chart utilizes color coding to differentiate these biotypes, with colors like orange for protein coding, blue for tRNA, and others. The visualization features markers including right and left triangles to denote gene strand orientation and lines to represent genomic intervals. It includes text annotations for gene names and categorizes data by strand, all presented with a smooth path styling. The whole chart maintains an opacity of 0.8 and is arranged for visual clarity and interactive examination of the genomic region.
