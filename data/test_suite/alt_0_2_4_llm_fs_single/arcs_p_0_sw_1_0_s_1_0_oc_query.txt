The visualization is a linear layout focusing on chromosome 1 from hg38 assembly, specifically displaying the region between 1 and 3,000,500. It consists of connection tracks visualizing a CSV dataset. Genomic positions from the CSV data define both endpoints of these links, forming arcs that indicate different genomic segments within the specified interval. The arcs on the chart are color-coded based on a nominal data field, with the lines having black strokes and low opacity to enhance visibility. This layout enables examination of interconnections within a specific genomic range, offering insights into potential structural variations or duplications.
