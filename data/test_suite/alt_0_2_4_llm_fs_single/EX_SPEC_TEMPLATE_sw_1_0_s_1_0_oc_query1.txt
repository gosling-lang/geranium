The visualization is a linear genomic range annotation track that illustrates data from chromosome 3, specifically the interval between 52,168,000 and 52,890,000 base pairs. It features genomic fields like start, end, and strand, with annotations displayed using directional arrows indicating gene orientations. This track employs a gene annotation template, highlighting features such as exons and genes, indicated by triangles and rectangles in gray. Gene labels are prominently displayed with a font size of 30, outlined in white for contrast. The view is stratified by strand orientation, allowing for clear depiction of gene directionality. The layout and styling enable smooth path representations for an intuitive view of the genomic region.
