A circular scatter plot displays genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The plot is arranged vertically with four categories ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'). Each category is represented by a distinct color, enhancing visual differentiation. The layout is static, utilizing a multivec dataset. Data points indicate expression values determined by their size and position within the circle, with point opacity set to 0.5. The plot includes a legend explaining the categorical colors, and tooltips provide additional information such as start and end positions, value, and sample category.
