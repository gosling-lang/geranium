A vertically arranged visualization consists of linear tracks that display genomic data for chromosome 1 using the hg38 assembly. The first track overlays a cytoBand ideogram from a CSV file, identifying chromosomal bands with rectangles and left and right triangles, colored in white. Following tracks use nominal color encoding for multiple chromosome categories. Three subsequent bar chart tracks visualize genomic position data from vector files, with peak values represented in purple bars and navy blue outlines. The concluding track overlays gene annotations from a BED database, displaying strands with navy blue rectangles and lines, separated by positive and negative strand categories. The visualization spans genomic coordinates between 109,000,000 and 112,000,000, incorporating interactive zoom and pan capabilities for user exploration.
