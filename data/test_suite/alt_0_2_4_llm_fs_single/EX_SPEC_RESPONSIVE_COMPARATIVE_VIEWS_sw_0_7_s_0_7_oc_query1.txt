The visualization is a bar chart in a linear layout, displaying genomic data from chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The height of the bars indicates quantitative peak values from a multivec data file, and the bars are colored navy blue. The chart is responsive, adapting its width based on the display size, with a default arrangement being horizontal. The specification includes interaction elements such as linking, enabling dynamic exploration within the genome coordinates.
