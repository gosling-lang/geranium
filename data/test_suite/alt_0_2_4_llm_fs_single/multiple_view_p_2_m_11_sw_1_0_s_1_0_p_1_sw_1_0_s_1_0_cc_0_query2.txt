A vertical arrangement of visualizations featuring a linear and a circular track side-by-side. The linear track depicts a genomic area on chromosome 2 using an area chart stratified by rows for categories, encoded with distinct colors. This view supports interaction through a linked brush for detailed exploration. The circular track represents the same genomic data with a line chart, also stratified by categories and similarly colored. It provides an overview with layers aligned in a circular layout, facilitating interaction with a linking brush. Data is fetched from a multivec source, and categories include samples 1 to 4, each visualized in a designated color.
