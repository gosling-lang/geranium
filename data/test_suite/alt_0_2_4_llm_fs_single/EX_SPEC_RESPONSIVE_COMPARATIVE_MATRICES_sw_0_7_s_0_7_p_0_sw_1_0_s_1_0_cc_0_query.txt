The visualization is a set of overlaid matrix heatmaps arranged in a linear layout, focusing on chromosome 10. It consists of two main genomic matrices displaying data in two color scales: grey and viridis. The axes represent genomic intervals on chromosome 10. The intensity of the colors corresponds to quantitative expression values. The heatmaps are displayed using an overlay alignment with each matrix occupying different quadrants: the lower-left is in grey, and the upper-right is in viridis. This setup allows for comparative genomic analysis across the matrices. The visualization is responsive, adapting to screen width changes for optimal display.
