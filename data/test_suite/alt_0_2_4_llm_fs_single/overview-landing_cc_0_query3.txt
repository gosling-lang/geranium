The visualization is composed of four distinct tracks arranged vertically, focusing on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. 

1. **Bar Chart**: Displays genomic data on the x-axis with peak values on the y-axis. The bars are color-coded by categories corresponding to four samples, and a legend provides sample identification. 

2. **Overlay Chart with Line and Points**: Features lines and points stratified by sample. The x-axis denotes genomic position, and the y-axis shows quantitative peaks. Point sizes represent the height of expression values.

3. **Heat Map**: Visualizes genomic intervals on the x-axis, encoding expression values through color intensity. The chart is organized by samples in rows, with categorized color representations.

4. **Row-Stratified Bar Chart**: Similar to the first chart, this bar graph is stratified by rows, using colors to differentiate categories across samples.

Each chart uses tooltip annotations to provide detailed genomic information. The data is sourced from a multivec file containing samples 1 to 4.
