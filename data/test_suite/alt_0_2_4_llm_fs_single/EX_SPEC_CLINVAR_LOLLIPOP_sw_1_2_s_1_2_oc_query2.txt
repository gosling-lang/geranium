A genomic visualization featuring two tracks in a linear layout, presenting data between the nucleotide positions 32,314,000 and 32,402,500 on chromosome 13. The top track is a genomic range annotation that displays genes and exons. It uses blue triangles, text, and patterned lines to depict gene orientations and names, stratified by strand (plus or minus). The chart represents the BRCA2 gene. The bottom track shows pathogenicity data from a BED file, visualized as light gray bars and color-coded points. Categories such as 'Pathogenic', 'Likely benign', and 'Benign' are represented by different colors, including pink, green, and blue, respectively. The layout allows for detailed representation of overlapping genomic data, utilizing color and spatial arrangement to convey multiple layers of information.
