A multi-row scatter plot in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 5 between positions 150,000,000 and 200,000,000. The data is stratified into four rows, each representing different samples ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'). Points are plotted to show genomic positions (x-axis) against expression values (y-axis). Each row is color-coded with blue, orange, green, and red, corresponding to the different samples. The chart's vertical arrangement highlights variation across the chromosome region.
