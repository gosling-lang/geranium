The visualization consists of two horizontally arranged panels, each with three main sections. They depict genomic data for chromosome 7, spanning from positions 77,700,000 to 81,000,000.

1. **Bar Charts**: 
   - In each panel, there are three bar charts showing different genomic data types:
     - The first chart displays data from a bigWig file, representing genomic peaks in purple bars.
     - The second chart uses dark green bars to represent another genomic dataset, also derived from a bigWig file.
     - The third chart overlays two datasets: orange bars from a CTCF bigWig file, and genomic annotations visualized with pink right and green left triangles indicating strand direction from a beddb file.

2. **Matrices**:
   - Below the bar charts, matrices display interaction data:
     - The matrices use a warm color scheme to encode contact strengths, with genome positions on both the x- and y-axes.

3. **Multivec Tracks**:
   - At the bottom, multivec tracks show annotations with specific categories using distinct colors, representing various genomic features like active TSS, enhancers, and heterochromatin in bar form.

This detailed genomic visualization integrates diverse data types and color schemes to highlight structural and functional elements within the specified chromosomal region.
