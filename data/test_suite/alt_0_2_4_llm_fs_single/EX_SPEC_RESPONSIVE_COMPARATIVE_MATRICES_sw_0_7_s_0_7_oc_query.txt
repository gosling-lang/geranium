This visualization features an overlaid matrix of two genomic matrices located on chromosome 10. The layout is horizontal, with two primary tracks, each displayed in separate quadrants of the chart. The first matrix, positioned in the lower-left quadrant, uses varying shades of grey to depict the genomic data, while the second matrix in the upper-right quadrant utilizes shades of pink for its data representation. Both matrices illustrate genomic interactions, with axes marking genomic intervals. The visualization adapts responsively to wide viewports, ensuring clarity and detail in its presentation.
