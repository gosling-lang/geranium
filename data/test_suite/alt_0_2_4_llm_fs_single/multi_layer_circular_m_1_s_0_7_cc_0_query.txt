The visualization is a multi-row line chart in a circular layout, displaying a multivec file that features chromosome 12 ranging from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000 base pairs, based on the hg38 assembly. Each line represents a sample category, with seven categories in total, excluding the filtered-out entries denoted as "sample -". The lines encode quantitative data fields named "peak" with values from 0 to 0.01, using different colors for each category: blue, orange, green, red, purple, brown, and pink. The circular layout highlights stratification by rows corresponding to each sample category.
