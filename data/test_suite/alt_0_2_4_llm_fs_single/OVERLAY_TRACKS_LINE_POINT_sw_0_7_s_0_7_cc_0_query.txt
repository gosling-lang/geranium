The visualization is a multivec file displayed as a combination of a line chart and scatter plot, in a linear layout, representing genomic data across chromosome 1, from position 1 to 3,000,500. The x-axis indicates genomic positions from a specified multivec data source, with each category from 'sample 1' to 'sample 4' shown in separate rows. The y-axis represents quantitative 'peak' values. Points in the scatter plot vary in size based on the 'peak' values and are color-coded according to their sample, with a palette of blue, orange, green, and red. The dataset contains detailed multivariate genomic information, allowing for insights into variations in expression levels across different samples.
