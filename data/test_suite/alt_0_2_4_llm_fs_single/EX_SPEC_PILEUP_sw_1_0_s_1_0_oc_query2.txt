The visualization is a linear layout of a pileup track using BAM data, specifically focusing on chromosome 1 between positions 136,750 and 139,450. The chart contains rectangles representing individual reads. These are stratified into rows based on the pileup method used to displace them vertically. The colors of the rectangles indicate different structural variants or read types, such as 'normal read,' 'deletion (+-),' 'inversion (++),' 'inversion (--),' 'duplication (-+),' 'more than two mates,' 'mates not found within chromosome,' and 'clipping.' The legend indicates an insert size of 300bp, and the tooltip provides additional genomic information like start and end positions, insert size, and others. The layout is made interactive with a focus on detailed inspection of genome intervals.
