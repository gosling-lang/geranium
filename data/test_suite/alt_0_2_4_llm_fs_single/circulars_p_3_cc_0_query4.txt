A circular visualization consists of two horizontally arranged tracks, each representing genomic data on chromosome 1 for the interval between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The left track displays links within a genomic range, shown as connections colored in a variety of hues indicating different categories based on the field 's1.' The right track is an area chart illustrating multivec data stratified by rows for four sample categories. Each sample is represented by colored areas, utilizing shades like blue, orange, green, and red. The visualization uses the X-axis for genomic positions and the Y-axis for quantitative values, with a radial arrangement ensuring a clear view of overlapping data points.
