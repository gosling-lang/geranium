The visualization consists of two tracks arranged in a linear layout, each displaying data from chromosome 2. The top track uses a line chart to represent genomic data, with the x-axis showing genomic positions and the y-axis displaying quantitative expression values. The data is categorized by samples, with "sample 1" in blue and "sample 3" in orange. The bottom track uses an area chart, similarly displaying genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Here, "sample 1" is displayed in blue, and "sample 2" in orange. Both tracks are differentiated by color and stratified by sample categories.
