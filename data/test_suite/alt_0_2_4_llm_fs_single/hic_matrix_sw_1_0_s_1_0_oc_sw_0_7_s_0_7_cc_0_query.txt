The visualization is a heat map in a linear layout, showcasing genomic interactions from chromosome 5 to 10 of the hg38 assembly. Both the x- and y-axes display genomic positions within the interval from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000. The data, derived from a matrix file type, encodes interaction intensity using a "hot" color range. The visualization depicts a 600x600 dimension, with color gradients representing quantitative expression values.
