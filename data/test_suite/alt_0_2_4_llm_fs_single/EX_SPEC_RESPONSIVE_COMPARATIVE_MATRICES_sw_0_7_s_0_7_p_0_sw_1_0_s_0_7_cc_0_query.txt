A pair of overlaid genomic matrices shows chromosome 10 interaction data in a horizontal arrangement. The first track uses a pink color gradient to represent quantitative data values, while the second track employs a hot color gradient. The matrices visually encode expression values through color intensity. Both x and y axes represent genomic coordinates, showing intervals along chromosome 10. The tracks are set to a linear layout with linking enabled for interactive navigation. The visualization uses a HiGlass view, displaying densely packed interaction data in two distinct color schemes to indicate varying data ranges.
