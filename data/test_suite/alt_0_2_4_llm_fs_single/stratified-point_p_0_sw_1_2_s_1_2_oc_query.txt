The visualization is a scatter plot in a linear layout, displaying a multivec file across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. It features three rows representing 'sample 1', 'sample 2', and 'sample 3'. Each row is distinguished by colors: orange, green, and blue. The positions on the x-axis are genomic, while the y-axis represents quantitative 'peak' values. The size and color of points correspond to the peak value and sample category, respectively. This chart includes interactive tooltips detailing the start and end positions, peak value, and sample information. The chart is semi-transparent with an opacity of 0.5, enhancing the visual differentiation of overlapping data points. The layout is flexible, allowing dynamic zooming and panning to explore different genomic intervals efficiently.
