The visualization is a linear ideogram of chromosome 12. It uses data from a CSV file to represent genomic intervals. The chromosomal regions are color-coded according to their stain types, including "gneg", "gpos25", "gpos50", "gpos75", "gpos100", and "gvar", displayed using shades of gray to black and a blue for variable regions. Key cytobands are highlighted with labels positioned above or below the ideogram based on track height. The red triangles indicate centromeric regions, marking the "p" and "q" arms of the chromosome. This visualization is dynamic, allowing responsive changes in width and height, and designed within the hg38 assembly framework.
