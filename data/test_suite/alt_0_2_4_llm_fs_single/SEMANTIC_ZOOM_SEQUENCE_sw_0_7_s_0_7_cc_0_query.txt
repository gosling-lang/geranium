The visualization is a horizontal linear track displaying genomic data using a multivec file. It features overlaid bar and text tracks, representing base counts ('A', 'T', 'G') across genomic positions. The bar track, without an axis, encodes quantitative base counts using different colors: blue for 'A', orange for 'T', and green for 'G'. Text annotations appear in white for intervals meeting specific zoom levels and thresholds. The full color range includes additional bases, such as 'C'. The chart spans a width of 392 pixels and height of 86 pixels, utilizing bold styling for textual elements.
