A linear genomic visualization encompassing four distinct tracks arranged vertically to explore chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The first track presents a heat map where genomic intervals on the x-axis are colored to reflect expression values, categorized by samples. Subsequent tracks include two bar charts with x-axes depicting genomic position and y-axes illustrating expression levels, differentiated by sample-based coloration. The third track features a bar chart with an additional focus on grid alignment. The final track overlays a line chart with a scatter plot, showcasing expression through lines and variable-sized points, with categorization by color for each sample row. This multi-layered display enables detailed genomic data visibility, amplified by interactive tooltips, aligning with the hg38 assembly.
