The visualization is a circular line chart displaying multiple time-series data from a multivec file. It shows genomic intervals on the x-axis with lines representing expression values on the y-axis. The data corresponds to chromosome 12, ranging from positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. Each line is colored differently to represent distinct samples, stratified into multiple rows with varying opacity levels. The chart is based on the study "Graphical perception of Multiple Time Series" by Javed et al. in TVCG 2010.
