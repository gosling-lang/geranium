A heatmap visualizes genomic data from a multivec file, displaying chromosome 1 positions between 1 and 3,000,500. The data is stratified by three samples, with each sample represented as a separate row. The color intensity encodes the quantitative values from the 'peak' field, using a 'hot' color scheme to highlight variations. The x-axis indicates genomic positions, and tooltips provide detailed information on position and value for each rectangle.
