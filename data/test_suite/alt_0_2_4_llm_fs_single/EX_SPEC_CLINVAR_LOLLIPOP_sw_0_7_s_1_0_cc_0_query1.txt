A two-track linear layout visualizes genomic data on chromosome 13, between positions 31,500,000 and 33,150,000. The top track presents a gene annotation track with directional indicators, where 'plus' and 'minus' strands are represented with blue right-pointing and orange left-pointing triangles, respectively. Exons are depicted with rectangles, and gene names are in text form, aligned with these symbols. The bottom track shows genomic variations using bars and points. The variations are categorized into 'Pathogenic', 'Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic', 'Likely pathogenic', 'Uncertain significance', 'Likely benign', 'Benign/Likely benign', and 'Benign', each with a distinct color. Points and bar heights indicate significance levels visually, where the colors correlate to variation categories, aiding in the visual distinction of genomic data significance.
