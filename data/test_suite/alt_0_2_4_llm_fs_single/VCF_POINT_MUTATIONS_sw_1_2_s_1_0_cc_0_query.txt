A linear scatter plot uses a VCF file to visualize genomic data along the x-axis, representing positions on the genome, and the y-axis indicating distance to previous mutations. Each point represents a mutation, colored by subtype ('C>A', 'C>G', 'C>T', 'T>A', 'T>C', 'T>G'), which helps distinguish different mutation types. The graphic is interactive, with tooltips displaying specific genomic positions and subtype information. It supports zooming and panning, enhancing exploration of the hg38 assembly. The visualization is formatted in an 800x160 layout, emphasizing data readability and clarity.
