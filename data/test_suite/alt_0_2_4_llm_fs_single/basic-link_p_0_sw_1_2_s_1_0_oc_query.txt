The visualization is a linear arc diagram illustrating genomic connections on chromosome 1. The connections, represented as curved lines, are formed between genomic intervals specified in a CSV file. These arcs, colored in steel blue, highlight segmental duplications or similar genomic relationships. The x-axis delineates genomic positions, allowing for easy localization of these interactions along chromosome 1. The dataset originates from a UCSC-hosted file containing genomic field specifications such as start and end points for these connections. The chart offers a comprehensive view of genomic architecture within the specified domain of chromosome 1, providing insights into structural variations.
