A circular line and scatter plot displays genomic data for chromosome 1 within the interval of 1 to 3,000,500. The layout is circular and arranged vertically with a center radius of 0.5. The visualization is static and stratified by rows across different samples, specifically 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'. The x-axis represents genomic positions while the y-axis represents quantitative peak values. Points' sizes correspond to peak values, with lines and points colored according to the sample categories. Tooltips reveal details such as position, peak value, and sample category when interacted with.
