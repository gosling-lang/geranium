A circular visualization displaying genomic data across five chromosomes (chr1 to chr5) is arranged in a spiral configuration. Each chromosome is depicted with two main tracks: an area chart and an ideogram. The area charts represent quantitative peaks for three samples, differentiated by color, plotted against genomic positions. Beneath each area chart, ideograms show cytogenetic bands with rects, text, and arrowheads denoting specific stain categories, including bands and density variations. The colors used include black for text and white to black graduation for density, while purple and maroon highlight specific band features.
