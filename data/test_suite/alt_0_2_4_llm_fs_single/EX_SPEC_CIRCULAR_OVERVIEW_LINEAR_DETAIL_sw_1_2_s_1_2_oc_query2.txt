A dual bar chart in a horizontal layout visualizes a multivec file, showing genomic data for chromosomes 5 and 16. Each chart is stratified by four sample categories, displayed in orange, green, blue, and purple. The position of bars along the x-axis corresponds to genomic intervals, while the y-axis represents quantitative values from the 'peak' data field. The charts feature a subtle background, blue for chromosome 5 and red for chromosome 16, and include a legend indicating the color associated with each sample category.
