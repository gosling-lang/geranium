A linear text plot visualizes genomic data across multiple chromosomes, showing the interval position on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis with text labels. The text colors represent different nucleotide bases: adenine (A) in orange, thymine (T) in green, and guanine (G) in blue. The genome is coded with quantitative expression counts, with larger text indicating higher counts. The visualization is assembled on hg38 and allows panning and zooming for detailed exploration.
