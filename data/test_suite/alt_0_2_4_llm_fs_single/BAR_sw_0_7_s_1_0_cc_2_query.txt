The linear bar chart visualizes genomic data from a multivec file, representing the entire genome of hg38. The chart is displayed with genomic intervals on the x-axis and quantitative values on the y-axis. Each bar is colored in lavender, indicating genomic expressions, and spans the regions defined by the 'start' and 'end' fields. The axes are positioned at the top and bottom, enhancing the readability of the genomic positions and expression values. The visualization is titled 'Genomic Data Visualization' and spans a width of 560 pixels.
