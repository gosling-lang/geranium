The visualization consists of two circular charts aligned horizontally. The left chart is a circular bar chart representing multivec data with genomic positions from chromosome 1, ranging from 1 to 3,000,500. The bars are colored based on four categories: "sample 1" (yellow), "sample 2" (green), "sample 3" (blue), and "sample 4" (pink). The height of the bars reflects the peak values.

The right chart overlays a circular line chart and a circular scatter plot using the same data. Lines represent the genomic positions and peak values for each sample, while points are sized proportionally to the peak values, adding another layer of information. The categories are distinguished by color, corresponding to the same four samples. The charts feature interactive tooltips that provide detailed genomic positions, values, and sample information.
