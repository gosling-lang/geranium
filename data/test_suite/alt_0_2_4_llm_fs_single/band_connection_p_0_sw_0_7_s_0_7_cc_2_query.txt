The visualization is a linear layout displaying chromosomal data for chromosome 1, within the interval of 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. It comprises three different track pairs, each showing genomic regions and connections between regions.

1. **Colored Rectangles**: Each pair contains tracks with rectangles, representing genomic intervals visualized in sky blue. These tracks use CSV data from a specified URL with fields such as 's1', 'e1', 's2', and 'e2'.

2. **Connections (BetweenLinks)**: Between these tracks are connections depicted with subtle line colors for differentiation (pink and purple), representing alignments or associations between genomic regions. These connections are visualized as "betweenLink" marks, adding contextual linkage.

3. **Styling Details**: 
   - The stroke around the shapes uses the color "#4C6629" with a width of 0.8.
   - Opacity is set to 0.15 for a light overlay effect.
   - Tooltips with start and end positions are available, presented in green styled text.

The visualization effectively illustrates genomic segment duplications and their connections, providing insight into structural genomics using clear color distinctions and defined intervals.
