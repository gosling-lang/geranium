A linear visualization displays genomic data overlaid with matrix and point plot tracks. The chart spans the genomic interval from 800,000,000 to 1,600,000,000. The primary dataset is a matrix displayed as bars, depicting spatial relationships across chromosome intervals with color intensity as a representation of expression values. Overlaid on this is a bar plot based on a JSON dataset featuring chromosomes 6, 7, and 8, with stroke colors differentiating categories. The third track is a point plot, also using JSON data, where the point size represents a quantitative value field "v" and the color is steelblue. The visual configuration includes various dashed line styles and styling components, such as stroke widths and opacities, giving a nuanced, structured view of the genomic data. The coordinate system adheres to human genome assembly hg38, with interactive zoom constraints.
