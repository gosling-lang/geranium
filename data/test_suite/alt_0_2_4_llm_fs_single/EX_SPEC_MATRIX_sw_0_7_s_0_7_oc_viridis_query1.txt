A genomic matrix overlay visualization displays data from multiple chromosomes in a linear layout using the hg38 assembly. The x- and y-axes represent genomic intervals from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000, showing chromosomes like chr2, chr5, and chr10. The primary overlay is a matrix where color intensity, following the 'viridis' range, encodes quantitative values. It includes red vertical and blue horizontal dashed lines, emphasizing specific genomic positions at 100,000 bp for chr2, chr5, and chr10. These lines use consistent stroke width, integrating different data sources to highlight features within the matrix.
