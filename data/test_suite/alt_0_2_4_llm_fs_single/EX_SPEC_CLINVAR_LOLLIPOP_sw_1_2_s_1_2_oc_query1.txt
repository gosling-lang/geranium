The visualization is arranged vertically and features two main tracks displaying genomic data for chromosome 13 between 32,000,000 and 32,700,000. The top track is a genomic annotation track displaying gene information with text labels for gene names and directional arrows indicating gene orientation. Exons are shown as rectangles; genes on the positive strand are in blue, while those on the negative strand are in red. 

The bottom track visualizes ClinVar data with two overlaid charts: a bar and a point chart. The bars are color-coded to indicate different clinical significance categories such as 'Pathogenic' (pink), 'Likely Benign' (green), and more. Points represent individual data points of significance, stratified by rows for each category. The bar's height indicates the significance level, with a transition in visibility based on zoom level. The track also includes a multivec layer displaying aggregated counts of significance categories as bars.
