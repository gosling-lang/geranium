The visualization is a linear genomic range annotation track, visualizing data along chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. It features gene annotations displayed with text labels and rectangles. Genes are stratified along the y-axis based on their strand orientation, with the '+' strand genes colored in blue and '-' strand genes in red. Rectangles represent both gene outlines and exons, while lines connect gene start and end positions. The width of the track is set to 350 units, and it arranges data vertically. This visualization uses the HG38 genome assembly.
