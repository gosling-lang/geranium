A circular visualization with two tracks shows genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The left track is a circular bar chart with rows representing samples 1 to 4, each colored differently. The x-axis displays genomic positions, and the y-axis shows quantitative peaks. The right track is a circular heatmap, with genomic intervals on the x-axis and color intensity indicating expression values. Both charts are stratified by rows for different samples, enabling comparison across samples. The static layout employs the multivec data type, providing a detailed view of the genomic data in a compact, visually engaging format.
