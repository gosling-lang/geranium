A linear area chart displays genomic data from a multivec file across the entire hg38 genome assembly. The x-axis represents the genomic positions, while the y-axis encodes the 'peak' values quantitatively. The area under the curve is filled with a purple color, enhancing visual distinction. This visualization uses a linear layout with a specific height and width, ensuring detailed representation and clarity.
