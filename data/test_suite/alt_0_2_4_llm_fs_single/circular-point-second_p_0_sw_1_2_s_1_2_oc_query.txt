Circular scatter plot visualization in a vertical arrangement displays genomic data on the assembly hg38 for chromosome 1, spanning from positions 1 to 3,000,500. Points are colored based on four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4.' The radius represents expression values, and point size is proportional to the expression value ('peak'). The plot includes an interactive legend, grid for the y-axis, and tooltips showing genomic start and end positions along with the numerical value of 'peak.' The opacity of the points is set to 0.5 to enhance visibility.
