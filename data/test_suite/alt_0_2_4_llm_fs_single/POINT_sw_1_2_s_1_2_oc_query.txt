A scatter plot in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, covering the entire genome of hg38. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis encodes the quantitative 'peak' values. The size of each point corresponds to the 'peak' field data. The layout is oriented horizontally with a width of 1152 units. Points are plotted in orange, providing a clear visual of expression values across different genome regions.
