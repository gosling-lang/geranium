A circular bar chart visualizes a vector file representing the entire genome of the hg38 assembly. The bars, colored in light purple, are aligned along the circumference, depicting genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative data field 'peak' on the y-axis. The layout is static with a center radius of 0.3 and a spacing of 1. The chart uses a circular alignment suitable for genome-wide visualization.
