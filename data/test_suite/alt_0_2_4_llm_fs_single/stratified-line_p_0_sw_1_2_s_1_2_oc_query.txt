The visualization consists of an overlay line-chart and scatter plot in a linear layout, displaying genomic data across chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The visualization is stratified into four separate rows corresponding to categories labeled 'sample 1' through 'sample 4', each row showcasing distinct color-coded lines and points: yellow, green, blue, and pink, respectively. The x-axis represents genomic position, capturing the chromosomal intervals, while the y-axis denotes quantitative expression values, with the height of points indicating the expression magnitude. The size of scatter plot points varies based on the expression values. Tooltips provide detailed insights, revealing genomic positions, quantitative values, and sample identifiers upon interaction.
