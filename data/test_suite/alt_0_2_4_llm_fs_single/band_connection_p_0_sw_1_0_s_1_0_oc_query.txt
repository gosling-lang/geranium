The visualization is a linear representation focused on chromosome 1 within the interval from 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. It consists of three aligned tracks displaying genomic duplication data through rectangles and connecting lines. The first and third tracks use green rectangles to indicate genomic positions with duplication, featuring thin outlines. The second track employs transparent green connections to denote relationships between duplicated segments, overlapping both up and downstream regions. The genomic data is sourced from a CSV file, and these annotations effectively highlight duplications within this specific chromosomal region using shades of green. The opacity of elements allows for the visualization of stacked overlaps.
