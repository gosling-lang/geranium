A horizontal linear visualization displays annotated genomic data for chromosome 3, spanning positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000, based on the hg38 assembly. It features an overlay of multiple marks, including black text labels for gene names and gray triangles indicating gene direction. Light gray rectangles represent gene regions, while purple rectangles with dark purple strokes indicate exons. Gray lines illustrate genetic regions, with positive and negative strands stratified across two rows.
