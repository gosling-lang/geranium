The visualization shows two coverage and pileup tracks in a linear layout using BAM data, each covering different genomic intervals on chromosome 1. The first interval is between positions 205,000 and 207,000, and the second is between 490,000 and 496,000. The coverage track is represented by silver bars indicating read depths. The pileup track displays individual reads stratified by rows for categories such as 'normal read', 'deletion (+-)', 'inversion (++)', 'inversion (--)', 'duplication (-+)', 'more than two mates', 'mates not found within chromosome', and 'clipping', each depicted with distinct colors. A legend indicates an insert size of 300 base pairs. The layout is vertical with spacing between views.
