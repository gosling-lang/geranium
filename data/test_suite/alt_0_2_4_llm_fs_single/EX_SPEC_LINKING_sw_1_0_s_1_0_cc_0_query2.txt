A visualization consisting of a circular and a linear bar chart represents genomic data from chromosome 1. The circular chart displays aggregated genomic peaks across four categories, each color-coded and stratified by rows. A brush links this view to the linear chart below, which zooms into the genomic interval between 160,000,000 and 200,000,000 base pairs. The linear chart details quantitative peak data for the same four categories, maintaining the color scheme for clarity. This composition allows for an interactive examination of genomic variations and relationships across different samples.
