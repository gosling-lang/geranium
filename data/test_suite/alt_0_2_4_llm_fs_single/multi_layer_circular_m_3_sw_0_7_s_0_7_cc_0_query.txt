The visualization is a multi-row circular bar chart, representing chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. It displays data from multiple samples, categorized by rows and colored distinctly. The data is filtered to exclude "sample -" and stratified into different layers based on the 'peak' value, providing a detailed view of quantitative variations. The outermost track corresponds to the highest peak values, decreasing inward. The rows, stratified by samples from 1 to 16 (excluding some missing samples), reveal the genomic positions on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis. Each layer's opacity varies to enhance depth and differentiation across ranges. This configuration aids in analyzing genomic variations across different samples visually within defined intervals.
