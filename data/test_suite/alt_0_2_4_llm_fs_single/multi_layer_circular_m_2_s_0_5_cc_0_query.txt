The circular area chart visualizes a multivec dataset, displaying chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The data is represented in six distinct rows, categorized from samples 1 to 8, excluding 'sample -'. Each row is colored differently to distinguish various data categories. The genomic positions are along the perimeter, with expression levels depicted by the area size within each row. The HG38 assembly data is used, offering a detailed look at the genomic interval specified in the circular layout.
