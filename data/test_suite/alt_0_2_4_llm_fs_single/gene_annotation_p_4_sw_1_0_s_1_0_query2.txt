The visualization presents a linear layout displaying genomic data for chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. It consists of three vertical panels:

1. **Top Panel**: Genomic range annotation with text labels for gene names along the x-axis. Exons are shown as purple rectangles with gray outlines. Forward and reverse strands are represented by right and left gray triangles, respectively.

2. **Middle Panel**: Genomic range annotation shows genes along the x-axis, differentiated by strand. Forward strands are blue and reverse strands are red. Exons are represented as small rectangles, while introns are depicted as thin lines.

3. **Bottom Panel**: A simple genomic range annotation displays gene positions with gray rectangles for the entire gene, red for exons, and cyan for introns.

Each panel is stratified by strand orientation, emphasizing the genomic structure and intervals of genes within the specified region.
