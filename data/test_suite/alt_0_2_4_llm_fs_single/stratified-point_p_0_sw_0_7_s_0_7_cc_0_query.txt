The visualization is a multi-track scatter plot in a vertical linear arrangement, displaying genomic data for chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. Each track represents samples categorized as 'sample 1' to 'sample 4', shown in varying colors: blue, orange, green, and red. Points encode 'peak' values, with size and position indicating quantitative data on the y-axis, while color represents categorical data. The plot allows interactive exploration through opacity settings and tooltips, conveying start and end genomic positions and value details. The chart spans a width of 294 pixels and a height of 91 pixels, with genomic positions mapped on the top axis. The layout provides a clear view of sample-specific genomic peaks.
