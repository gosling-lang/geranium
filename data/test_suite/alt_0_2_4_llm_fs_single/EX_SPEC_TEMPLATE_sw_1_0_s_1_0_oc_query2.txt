The visualization consists of two linear tracks stacked vertically. The top track is a bar chart representing multivec sequence data for chromosome 1, between positions 77,925,299 and 77,925,320. Bars display the count of bases (A, T, G, C), with color-coded categories and text labels indicating base identity. The bottom track is an ideogram of chromosome 1 from the UCSC HG38 cytoBand dataset, showing genomic regions with color-coded staining patterns. Rectangles, triangles, and text labels represent different cytogenetic bands and features. The layout emphasizes smooth path style and interactive zooming capabilities.
