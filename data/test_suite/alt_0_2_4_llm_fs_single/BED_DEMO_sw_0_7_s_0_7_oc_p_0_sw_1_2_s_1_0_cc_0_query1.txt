A linear chart in a vertical arrangement visualizes genomic intervals on chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 2,000,000. It consists of two tracks with rectangular marks. The top track displays intervals in green, representing data from a BED12 file, while the bottom track shows intervals in pink from a BED6 file. Both tracks use a consistent stroke color of black, emphasizing the genomic features.
