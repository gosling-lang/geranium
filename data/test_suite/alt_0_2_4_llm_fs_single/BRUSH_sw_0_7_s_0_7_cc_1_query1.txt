The visualization is a linear line chart displaying genomic data from chromosome 1. The x-axis represents genomic positions, and the y-axis quantifies expression values, shown as a continuous line colored in purple. The data is sourced from a multivec file with a single category, "sample 1." An overlay feature includes a selection brush, linked to other visualizations via a "linking-with-brush" ID, enhancing interactive exploration. The chart is rendered in the hg38 genomic assembly with a layout set to facilitate comparison across linear tracks.
