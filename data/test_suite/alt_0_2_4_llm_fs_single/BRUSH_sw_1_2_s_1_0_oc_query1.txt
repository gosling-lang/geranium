The visualization is a line chart in a linear layout, displaying genomic data from chromosome 1. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative expression values. Data is visualized using a multivec file with a sample from "sample 1." There is an interactive brush, colored in steel blue, allowing selection and linking to other charts. The chart spans a width of 960 pixels and a height of 230 pixels, using the Hg38 assembly.
