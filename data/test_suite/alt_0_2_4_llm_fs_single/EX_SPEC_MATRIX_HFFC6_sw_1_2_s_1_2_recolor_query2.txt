A horizontal layout visualization showing two tracks for chromosome 7, between positions 77,700,000 and 81,000,000, in the hg38 assembly. The top track is a heatmap matrix visualizing genomic data with color intensity indicating expression values, using a warm color scale. The bottom track is a categorized bar chart, displaying genomic intervals on the x-axis. The y-axis shows expression values with bar height, and the color of the bars represents different biological categories such as 'Active TSS' and 'Genic enhancers' in a palette ranging from red to gray. The background is light gray, providing a neutral backdrop for the data.
