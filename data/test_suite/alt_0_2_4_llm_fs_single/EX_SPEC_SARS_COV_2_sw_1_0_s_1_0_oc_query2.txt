A linear visualization of SARS-CoV-2 genome (NC_045512.2) depicts multiple genomic features across its 29,903 base pairs. The upper track uses rectangles to display important proteins like the "receptor-binding domain (RBD)" and "heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2)," each in distinct colors. Text annotations further identify these proteins. Below, a track shows gene symbols in navy blue rectangles with white outline, including directionality indicated by white triangle patterns. Another track visualizes nucleotide bases (A, T, G, C) as stacked bars, with colors indicating frequency. Finally, curved links represent recombination events, connecting genomic positions in light blue arcs, highlighting potential interactions.
