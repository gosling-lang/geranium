An overlaid visualization consisting of matrix charts and a scatter plot displays genomic data across chromosomes 6, 7, and 8 from a matrix file. The first overlaid track is a heat map where genome positions are shown on both axes, with color intensity depicting expression values. The second track repeats the genomic format with categories distinguished by bar strokes. Additionally, the chart includes points mapped onto the coordinates, their size reflecting specific quantitative measures. Points are illustrated in pink, providing a nuanced overlay on the matrix grid.
