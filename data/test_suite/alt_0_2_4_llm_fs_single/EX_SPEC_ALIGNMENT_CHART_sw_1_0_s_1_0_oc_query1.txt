A linear visualization displays genomic data from position 350 to 396 with three distinct charts. The first bar chart illustrates gap values with bars shaded in gray, where the bar height corresponds to the 'gap' measure. The second bar chart represents conservation values, using color to indicate different levels of 'conservation' with quantitative encoding. The third chart overlays rectangles and text, showing base sequences stratified by rows for various sequence names, each highlighted in distinct colors corresponding to the 'base' category. The visualization uses CSV datasets for data input.
