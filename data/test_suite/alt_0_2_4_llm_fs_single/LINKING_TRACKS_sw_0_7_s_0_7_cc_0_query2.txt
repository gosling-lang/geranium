A linear visualization of genomic data features two tracks: a multi-sample line chart and a single-sample area chart. Both tracks focus on chromosome 2, displayed on the x-axis, with genomic positions ranging from 1 to 242,193,529. The line chart track on top stratifies three samples—"sample 1," "sample 3," and "sample 4"—using distinct colors (blue, orange, and green). Each line represents the quantitative "peak" values on the y-axis, which range up to 0.002, reflecting expression levels across the chromosome. The bottom track visualizes "sample 2" with an area chart in blue, spanning the same genomic range, displaying quantitative "peak" values. Both tracks include white strokes for the lines or areas and have interactive elements for genomic exploration. The legend on the right aids in identifying sample-specific data representations through color coding.
