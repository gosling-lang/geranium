A linear area chart visualizes a multivec file, representing genomic data from the entire hg38 assembly. The x-axis displays genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative values of 'peak.' The filled area, colored sky blue, indicates expression levels. The chart spans various chromosomes, such as chr1, chr2, chr4, chr7, chr10, chr12, chr15, chr18, and chrX. The chart has a width of 560 and a height of 210, with axes labeled top for the x-direction and bottom for the y-direction.
