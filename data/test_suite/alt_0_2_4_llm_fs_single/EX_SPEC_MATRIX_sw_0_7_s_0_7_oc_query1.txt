The visualization is an overlaid matrix plot in a linear layout, showing genomic data from chromosomes 6, 7, and 8 of the hg38 assembly. The x-axis ranges from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000, while both the x- and y-axes represent genomic intervals. Color intensity encodes expression values, with a grey scale used to differentiate the data. Overlaid on the matrix are vertical red lines on the x-axis and horizontal blue lines on the y-axis, marking specific genomic positions (e.g., chr2, chr5, chr10). Additional overlaid bars are present within the matrix, with colors corresponding to quantitative values, displaying categories based on stroke colors, and adjusting transparency set to 0.5. The layout is styled with a dashed line pattern and a light gray background.
