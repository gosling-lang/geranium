Figure with 4 individual charts. Briefly, these are 2 different circular scatter plots, a circular chart with connections and a circular chart with area displayed.Circular scatter plot. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression values are shown with points on the y and size-axes. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the points.  Circular scatter plot. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression values are shown with points on the y and size-axes. The color of the points indicates the different categories.  Circular chart with connections. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The color of the connections indicates the different categories.  Circular chart with area displayed. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with area displayed. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the area displayed.
