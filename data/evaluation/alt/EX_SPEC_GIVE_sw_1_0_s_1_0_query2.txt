Figure with 6 individual charts. Briefly, these are a chart with rectangles and left and right triangles, a ideogram, 3 different bar charts and a genomic range annotation track and chart with rectangles.Chart with rectangles and left and right triangles. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.   The color of the rectangles, right triangles and left triangles is white. Ideogram. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The color of the rectangles indicates the different categories.  Bar chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars.  The color of the bars is purple. Bar chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars.  The color of the bars is purple. Bar chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars.  The color of the bars is purple. Genomic range annotation track and chart with rectangles. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the rectangles, rectangles, rectangles and lines is navy blue.
