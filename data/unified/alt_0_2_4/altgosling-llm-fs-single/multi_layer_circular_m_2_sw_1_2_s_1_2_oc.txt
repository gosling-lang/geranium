A circular area chart visualizes a multivec file, depicting data from chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. This visualization uses a circular layout where the genomic position is plotted on the horizontal axis, and peak values are plotted on the vertical axis. The chart is divided into multiple concentric rows, each representing different samples, with different colors used to distinguish between them. The chart highlights variations in peak intensities with semi-transparent overlays and focuses on small domains through varying opacity. The description includes a reference to the graphical perception of multiple time series by Javed et al. in TVCG 2010.
