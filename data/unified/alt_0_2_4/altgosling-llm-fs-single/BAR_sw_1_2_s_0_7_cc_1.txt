A bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, showing various genomic intervals on the x-axis. The y-axis represents quantitative peak values. The bars are colored sky blue, with the chart titled 'Basic Marks: bar' and subtitle 'Tutorial Examples'. This visualization illustrates genomic data from the hg38 assembly, using a bar mark type. The size of each bar is consistent, providing a clear representation of the data across the genome.
