A circular and linear integrated visualization showcases genomic data from the hg19 assembly, highlighting chromosome 1. The circular view includes an ideogram, a text annotation track for 'Putative Driver,' and two range annotation tracks, 'Gain' in sky blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange. It also features a connection track, displaying structural variations like 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' and 'Inversion' in various colors. The linear view mirrors these tracks but adds detailed annotations, including a point mutation scatter plot and layers for insertions and deletions. The scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' uses color to represent different mutation subtypes. Both views are interconnected by an interactive blue brush for seamless exploration between global and detailed genomic perspectives.
