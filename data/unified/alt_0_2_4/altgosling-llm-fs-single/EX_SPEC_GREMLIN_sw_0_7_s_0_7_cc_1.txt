The visualization titled "Gremlin (O'Brien et al. 2010)" presents a detailed genomic analysis focusing on chromosome 5. It utilizes a linear layout with elliptical link styles and interactive elements. The top chart displays the chromosome banding pattern with rectangles indicating different stains and text labeling specific bands. The chromosome 5 ideogram is detailed with a color scheme that includes pink for acen regions and green for text. This chart is interactive, with a brush linking to a lower chart.

Below the ideogram, two additional charts provide structural variant information. The first visualizes connection-based data with links represented by colored arcs, sorted in rows for chromosomes hs4, hs5, and hs6, each uniquely colored in blue, orange, and green. The second chart emphasizes details of the "Region of Interest," highlighting genomic interactions in sky blue and linking to detailed rearrangement patterns. The final chart, titled "Rearrangement View," narrows focus to a smaller genomic region, illustrating detailed structural rearrangements in light blue.

These linked views leverage CSV data and genomic filtering to stratify and color connections by chromosome categories, providing a comprehensive visualization of chromosomal rearrangements in chromosome 5 with an interval focus between positions 68,000,000 and 80,000,000.
