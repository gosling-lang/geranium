This visualization features a circular layout that represents data from chromosome 12, spanning positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. It utilizes a multivec file to display genomic data with points representing expression values plotted on the circular track. The circular scatter plot is stratified by category, with distinct colors assigned to each category of samples. Points are arranged radially, with genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. The chart simultaneously conveys multiple y-domains, allowing the viewer to discern different ranges of expression values and their corresponding categories. Each row illustrates a sample, with opacity levels and legends indicating different sections of quantitative data. The design's interactive nature and visual segmentation enhance comprehension of complex genomic relationships.
