The visualization presents two scatter plots in a vertical linear layout, showcasing a multivec dataset. Both plots depict genomic data across chromosome 1, spanning from base pair 1 to 3,000,500. Each point in the plots represents a sample peak, with size and vertical position encoding the peak's value. Four categories, labeled 'sample 1' to 'sample 4', are distinguished by different colors: orange, blue, teal, and pink. The top plot organizes points by category into rows, while the bottom plot displays all categories together. Opacity is set to 0.5 for transparency, enhancing visual clarity. Tooltip interactions provide genomic start and end positions, peak value, and sample identification.
