A circular and linear view are presented vertically with interactive connections. The circular view displays the genome of hg19, featuring an ideogram, putative driver annotations as text, and tracks for genomic gains, losses of heterozygosity (LOH), and structural variations. These tracks are adorned with distinct colors: blue for gains and orange for LOH. The line-connection track uses colors to differentiate categories like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.' A brush in the circular view allows linking and exploring corresponding regions in the linear view. The linear view highlights chromosome 1, showcasing tracks such as the ideogram, text annotations for putative drivers, point mutations as scatter plots, and range annotations for 'Copy Number Variants' and 'Insertion/Deletion.' Each point's color in the scatter plot indicates mutation subtype, while the range annotation tracks display quantitative data through bars in gray.
