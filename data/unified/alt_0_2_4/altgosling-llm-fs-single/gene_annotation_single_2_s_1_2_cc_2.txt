The visualization is a genomic range annotation track titled "IGV" displayed in a linear layout. It represents a segment of chromosome 3 from positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000, using data from a BED file. The track features multiple layers: gene names are displayed as text, exons as purple rectangles, and directional rules indicating gene strands. Rows are stratified by strand orientation (“+” or “−”). The text and features are colored purple, with white triangle patterns denoting strand directionality. The chart is part of a horizontal arrangement within hg38 assembly data.
