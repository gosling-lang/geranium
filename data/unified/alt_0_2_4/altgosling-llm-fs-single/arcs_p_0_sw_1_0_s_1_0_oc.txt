The visualization is a linear arc diagram titled "Visual Encoding" with the subtitle "Arcs." It spans chromosome 1, focusing on the genomic interval from 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. The arcs represent data from a CSV file, with positions and connections mapped on the x-axis. The color of each arc indicates different categories based on the 's1' field, providing a visual representation of connections across the genome. The subtle black stroke of each arc ensures clear demarcation, with an opacity of 0.2 enhancing the overlapping aesthetic. The entire diagram is 600 pixels wide and 160 pixels in height, using a center radius of 0.8 within the layout.
