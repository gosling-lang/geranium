The visualization consists of a parallel arrangement of linear views, each representing chromosomes 1 to 5 from the hg38 assembly. Each view contains two tracks: an area chart and an ideogram. The area chart displays quantitative peak values across sample categories using a multivec data type, with the x-axis representing genomic positions and the y-axis showing the expression levels. Colors in the area chart denote different samples.

The ideogram track overlays text, rectangles, and triangles to represent cytogenetic bands and densities from csv data. Rectangles vary in color based on the density field, while additional glyphs include maroon triangles for centromeric regions. The layout is static, with a defined width for each chromosome section. The stroke and text colors provide additional categorical differentiation within the ideogram.
