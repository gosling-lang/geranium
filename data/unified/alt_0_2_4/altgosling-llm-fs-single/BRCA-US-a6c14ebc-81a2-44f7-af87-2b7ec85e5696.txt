A circular and linear view are arranged vertically, portraying genomic data. The circular view displays the entire hg19 genome, featuring five tracks: an ideogram, a point annotation track, and three range annotation tracks. The ideogram offers an overview, with a blue brushing feature highlighting chromosome 1 to link with the linear view. 

Tracks include text annotations labeled "Putative Driver" and range annotations for "Gain" in blue and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in orange. A line-connection track visualizes structural variations with categories such as 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion' indicated by different colors.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, consisting of nine tracks. These tracks feature comparable data to the circular view, along with a gene annotation track, a scatterplot labeled "Point Mutation," and additional range annotation tracks for insertions and deletions showcasing distinctive colors and quantitative data. The overall arrangement provides a comprehensive visualization of genomic variations and annotations.
