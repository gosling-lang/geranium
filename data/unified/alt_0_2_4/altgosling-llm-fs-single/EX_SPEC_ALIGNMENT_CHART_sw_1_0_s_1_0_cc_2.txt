The visualization consists of four distinct charts displayed in a linear vertical layout. It includes two bar charts and two charts combining rectangles and text. The first bar chart, titled "Gap," uses sky blue bars to represent genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression levels on the y-axis. The second bar chart, titled "Conservation," shows genomic conservation with bars colored on a hot scale indicating varying expression values on both the y-axis and color dimensions.

A chart with rectangles and text presents genomic categories on the x-axis, with each rectangle and text row colored differently to signify distinct categories. Finally, the overlaid chart features multiple tracks, combining rectangles with two bar charts. The categories in the rectangles are signified by different colors, and the bars show expression levels with different color axes. A linking brush connects the top view to the overlaid chart to enable interactive exploration.
