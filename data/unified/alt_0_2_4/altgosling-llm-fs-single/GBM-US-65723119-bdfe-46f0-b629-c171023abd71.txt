A comprehensive genomic visualization, presented in a linear arrangement with a circular ideogram at the top and a linked linear view below. The circular ideogram includes tracks for genomic categories such as "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," represented in distinct colors like sky blue and dark orange. Interactive connections between genomic locations are shown based on structural variations, with categories such as "Translocation," "Duplication," and "Inversion." The bottom linear view, zoomed into chromosome 1, includes tracks for "Putative Driver" annotations with text, point mutation scatterplots colored by mutation type, and separate range tracks for "Insertion," "Deletion," and "Copy Number Variants." The visualization supports interactive exploration and provides detailed insights into genomic data, with a brush tool linking the two views for easy navigation.
