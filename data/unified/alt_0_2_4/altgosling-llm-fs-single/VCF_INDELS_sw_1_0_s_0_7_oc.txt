The visualization is a linear chart representing insertions and deletions from a VCF file with the subtitle "Insertions and deletions from a VCF file." It is designed in a horizontal orientation with row-based categorization for "Insertion" and "Deletion." The chart's genomic range is shown on the x-axis, stratified by chromosome labels like chr2, chr5, and chr8. Rectangles visualize the categories, colored distinctly: green for deletions and another color for insertions. White text indicates the transitions between reference and alternate alleles. The chart uses an overlay alignment to enhance visual clarity. The background is styled in light gray to ensure clarity.
