The visualization consists of two vertically arranged tracks displaying genomic data for chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The top track is an area chart that illustrates peak values against genomic coordinates, stratified by samples 'sample 1' through 'sample 4.' Each sample is represented by a distinct color: blue, orange, green, and red. Peak values are plotted on the y-axis, while genomic positions display along the x-axis. The bottom track is a multi-row bar chart, also stratified by the same samples. The bars represent peak ranges from minimum to maximum values along the y and ye-axes. Each sample is consistently color-coded across both tracks. The layout is linear with a center radius of 0.8 and interactive elements such as tooltips for detailed value inspection. The overall design facilitates comparison between area and bar chart representations of genomic data.
