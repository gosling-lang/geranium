A multi-layer area chart with a circular layout visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. Various samples, excluding 'sample -', are represented in multiple concentric rows, with each area shaded in distinct colors: blue, orange, green, red, purple, and brown. The area represents the 'peak' value, plotted against genomic positions.
