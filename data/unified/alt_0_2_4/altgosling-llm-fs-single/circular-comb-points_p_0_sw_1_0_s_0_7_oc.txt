The visualization features a vertical arrangement of two circular scatter plots. Both plots represent data from chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500, using a multivec file. The left chart displays expression values as points, stratified by rows for samples 1 through 4. Each sample is indicated by the color of the points, including yellow, green, blue, and pink. The right chart presents a similar scatter plot with a grid on the y-axis, highlighting the same samples in corresponding colors. Both charts share a consistent style, utilizing size to encode quantitative peak data and maintaining an opacity of 0.5 for visual clarity. The static nature and radial layout capture genomic insights effectively.
