The visualization is a horizontal linear arrangement displaying genomic ranges on chromosome 3, from positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. It features an overlaying track that includes annotations for genes, exons, and introns using rectangular marks. Genes are represented with gray rectangles, exons are shown in red, and introns in cyan. The track is stratified by strand, with positions denoted along the x-axis. The layout provides a concise view of the gene structure across specified genomic intervals.
