The visualization is a linear, vertically arranged bar chart displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. It encodes multivec data with four samples distinguished by color: sample 1 (orange), sample 2 (green), sample 3 (blue), and sample 4 (purple). Each bar's height represents quantitative 'peak' values. Genomic positions are displayed on the x-axis, with labeled intervals around 1,000,000 and 2,000,000. Tooltips provide detailed information on genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample identity, enhancing data interaction and interpretation.
