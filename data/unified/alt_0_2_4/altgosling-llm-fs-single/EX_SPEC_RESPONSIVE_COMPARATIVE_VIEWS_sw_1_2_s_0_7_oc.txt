The visualization consists of three linear bar charts aligned horizontally, each representing different genomic intervals. The data is sourced from a multivec file for chromosome 12 and 9, visualizing the genomic positions between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. Each chart employs different colors for the barsâ€”navy blue for the first track on chromosome 12, orange for the second on chromosome 9, and dark yellow for the third on chromosome 12 again. The y-axis encodes quantitative values of 'peak' from 'sample 1'. The charts are linked by a linkingId "1," allowing an interactive analysis, and the layout adjusts responsively to the screen width with a specified arrangement to switch to vertical if the width is less than 1200 pixels.
