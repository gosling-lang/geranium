A circular visualization featuring four tracks displays genomic data on the hg38 assembly. The outer track is an ideogram where chromosomal bands are color-coded based on the 'Stain' attribute, representing categories such as 'gneg,' 'gpos25,' and 'acen.' Within this, two tracks present copy number variations (CNVs) for tumors using purple rectangles, derived from a CSV file. The first CNV track filters on 'minor_cn_tumor' with a specified range, while the second focuses on 'total_cn_tumor.' The innermost track displays connections between chromosome positions, highlighting structural variants like 'tandem-duplication' and 'translocation,' with distinct colors and strokes for each category. This configuration overlays tracks for compact viewing.
