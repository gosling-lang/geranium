The visualization titled "Visual Linking" consists of interconnected charts showcasing genomic data from chromosome 1, in a vertical arrangement. The top chart is a scatter plot where colors represent different samples ('sample 1' in blue, 'sample 2' in orange, 'sample 3' in green, 'sample 4' in red). It plots genomic positions (x-axis) against quantitative peak values (y-axis), stratified by sample type. Below, a circular line chart similarly represents each sample with colored lines that trace genomic intervals. A brush feature allows users to select regions and update the detailed views dynamically, linking the scatter plot and line chart. Additionally, a third chart, depicted as an area chart, uses colors to show expression levels across genomic intervals. The design allows seamless interaction between views, enhancing detailed analysis of specified genomic regions.
