This circular visualization presents genomic data using a variety of tracks arranged in parallel. There is a notable circular bar chart for expression values, colored green, representing peaks. The track uses a multivec file to show genomic data, specifically from the hg38 assembly. Two circular ideograms depict chromosome bands colored according to different categories like "gneg" and "gpos" with diverse colors, such as blue and orange. A central circular chart features numerous connection lines representing genomic links, varying in shades from light gray to black, indicating data transformation from different chromosomes. The entire arrangement is stacked with precise spacing and aligned to emphasize connections between genomic intervals. The visualization is static, maintaining a focus on aesthetic clarity and easy interpretation of complex genomic relationships.
