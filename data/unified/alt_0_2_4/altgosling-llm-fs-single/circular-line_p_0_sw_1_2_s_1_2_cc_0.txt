A circular line and scatter plot in a genomic setting represent multivec data for chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500. The multivec data is visualized, with peak values encoded by the size of points and lines illustrating trends. The plot is segmented into rows corresponding to 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Lines and points are color-coded with blue, orange, green, and red, respectively, aligned with each sample. The layout features a vertical arrangement within circular dimensions, with an interactive legend denoting sample categories.
