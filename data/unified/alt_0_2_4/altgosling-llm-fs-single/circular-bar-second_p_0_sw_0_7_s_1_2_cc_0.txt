The visualization is a circular bar chart in a vertical layout, using data from a multivec file to display genomic information for chromosome 1, spanning 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. It features four tracks, each representing a different sample ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4'), differentiated by distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. Each track consists of bars that represent quantitative expression values aligned along the circular genome axis. The layout is static with the center radius set at 0.5, and it includes a tooltip displaying genomic positions and values. The color legend is visible, helping to distinguish the samples by color. The overall appearance is facilitated by dimensions specified as approximately 294x294, with circular orientation and a defined spacing parameter.
