The visualization is a dual-track layout displaying genomic data from chromosome 2. The top track is a line chart depicting the expression values for samples 1, 3, and 4. Each sample is represented with distinct colorsâ€”blue, orange, and green, respectively. The bottom track is an area chart displaying expression values for samples 1 and 2, also using blue and orange colors. Both tracks are stratified by samples, with x-axes representing genomic positions and y-axes showing expression levels. The data originates from a multivec file, and the layout is linear with consistent styling across tracks, including white strokes and a stroke width of 0.5.
