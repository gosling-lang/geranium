The visualization consists of two scatter plots arranged vertically, showing genomic data from chromosome 1 within the interval 1 to 3,000,500. Each plot displays data points where the genomic position is mapped to the x-axis and the peak values to the y-axis. Both plots use point size and color to encode quantitative and categorical information, respectively, based on 'peak' values and 'sample' categories ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'). The top plot stratifies data by sample categories using different colors, providing a comparative view of distribution across samples. In the bottom plot, the points are more densely packed, offering a detailed view. The plots incorporate transparency for overlapping points and provide interactive tooltips with genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample identifiers. The layout is linear with a specified center radius and spacing, enhancing visual clarity.
