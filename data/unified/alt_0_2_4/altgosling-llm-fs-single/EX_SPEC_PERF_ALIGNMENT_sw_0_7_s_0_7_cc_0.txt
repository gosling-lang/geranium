The visualization comprises two linear alignment tracks, each coded with colored rectangles representing genomic data. The title "Smoother Zoom" suggests an emphasis on optimizing rendering during zoom interactions, avoiding redrawing by dynamically scaling existing elements. In the upper track labeled "New Approach: Stretching Tiles," tiles stretch across genomic positions 350-396 without frequent redrawing. The lower track, labeled "Original Approach," follows a conventional overlay rendering. Both tracks utilize the same CSV dataset accessed from the web, mapping genomic fields 'pos' to nominal data fields, divided into rows per 'name.' Rectangles are color-coded by 'base' using a ten-color palette, with black text annotations becoming visible at lower zoom levels. These linked views enable comparative analysis of rendering strategies.
