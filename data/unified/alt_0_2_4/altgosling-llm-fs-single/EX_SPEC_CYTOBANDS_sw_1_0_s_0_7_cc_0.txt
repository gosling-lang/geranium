A sequence of linear area charts, representing multivec data across chromosomes 1 to 5, displays genomic positions on the x-axis with quantitative peaks on the y-axis. Each area chart is stratified by the 'sample' field with colors: blue, orange, green, red, and more. Under each genomic area, a cytogenetic band ideogram is overlaid. The ideograms use text labels for bands and colored rectangles for density. Red triangles highlight centromere positions. This visualization combines genomic data and cytogenetic features in parallel views for each chromosome.
