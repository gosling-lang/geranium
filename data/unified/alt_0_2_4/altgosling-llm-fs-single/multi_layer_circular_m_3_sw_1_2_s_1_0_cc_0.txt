This visualization is a circular bar chart showing genomic data for chromosome 12, visualizing positions between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. It is composed of multiple tracks layered in a circular format. Each track maps a sample dataset, where the bars represent quantitative values (peak) stratified by categories. The categories (sample 1 to sample 16) are indicated by different colors such as blue, orange, green, and red. The data is filtered to exclude certain samples, enhancing clarity. The layout is designed to portray differences across categories in a compact circular visualization. The description is referenced from Javed et al.'s study on graphical perception in time series visualization.
