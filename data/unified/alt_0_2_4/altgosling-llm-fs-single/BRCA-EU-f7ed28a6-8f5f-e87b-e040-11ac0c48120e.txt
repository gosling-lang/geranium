The visualization consists of a circular view and a linear view arranged vertically. A blue interactive brush in the circular view links the two views. The circular view represents the entire genome of hg19, featuring tracks like an ideogram, point annotation, genomic range annotations titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' and a line-connection track. Connections between genomic positions are colored based on structural variations such as 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.'

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, linked through the brush, displaying charts similar to the circular view. It includes an ideogram, 'Putative Driver' annotations, and gene annotations. Additional tracks include a scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation,' indicating distance to previous mutations. Range annotations show insertions and deletions, with rectangles for copy number variants in gray. Each component is interactive, offering detailed information about genomic features through hover and click actions.
