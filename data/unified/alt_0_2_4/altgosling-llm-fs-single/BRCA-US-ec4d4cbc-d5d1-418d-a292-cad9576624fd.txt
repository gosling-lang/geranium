A circular view and a linear view are arranged vertically, linked by an interactive brush in the circular view. The circular view displays the entire genome, and the linear view shows a detailed region of chromosome 1. The circular view includes five tracks: an ideogram, a point annotation track, two range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' (colored blue) and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' (colored red), and a connection track showing lines between genomic positions in different colors based on 'svclass' categories, such as 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' 'Inversion (TtT),' and 'Inversion (HtH).' 

The linear view mirrors these elements, featuring a gene annotation track, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation,' visualizing mutations from a VCF file with points represented by distance from previous mutations, and colored by 'SUBTYPE.' It also includes two additional range annotation tracks: one for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' visualized with rectangles in yellow and green, and another titled 'Copy Number Variants' that represents quantitative data in gray rectangles.
