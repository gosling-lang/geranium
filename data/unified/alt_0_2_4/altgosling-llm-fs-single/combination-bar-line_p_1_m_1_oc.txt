The visualization consists of a linear layout with a vertical arrangement, focusing on the genomic interval of chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track features a combination of a scatter plot and bar chart. It displays genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis as points and bars. Expression levels are also indicated by the size of the bars, with stratification into four separate rows by sample, corresponding to categories 'sample 1' through 'sample 4.' Each category is visually distinguished by unique colors.

The bottom track is an area chart that similarly maps genomic positions on the x-axis and expression levels on the y-axis, with areas filled according to categories, aligning with the same sample color coding as the top track. This track emphasizes the trend of expression levels over the specified genomic interval with color-coded sample representation. The visualization integrates interactive tooltips for detailed data exploration, which include genomic position, expression peak value, and sample category. This comprehensive view enables a comparative analysis of expression patterns across different samples within the specified genomic region.
