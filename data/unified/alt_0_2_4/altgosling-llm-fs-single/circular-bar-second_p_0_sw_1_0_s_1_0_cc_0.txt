A circular bar chart displays genomic data for chromosome 1, from positions 1 to 3,000,500. This visualization is divided into four concentric rows, each representing a different sample: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The y-axis encodes quantitative values with bars, while the color of the bars corresponds to the sample categories, using distinct colors such as blue, orange, green, and red. Tooltip functionality provides additional genomic information, including start/end positions, peak values, and sample names. This chart uses data from a multivec file and includes an interactive legend for category identification.
