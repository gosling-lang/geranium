The visualization consists of two horizontal linear tracks illustrating genomic data. The upper track, "New Approach: Stretching Tiles," employs a novel method that scales existing elements to ensure smoother zoom transitions. The lower track, "Original Approach," retains a conventional depiction without scaling adjustments. Both tracks feature alignments from a genomic CSV file, focusing on positions between intervals 350 to 396. Rectangles represent individual nucleotide bases, each colored uniquely, denoting different categories. Text annotations provide base information, visible predominantly at higher zoom levels. The layout emphasizes comparability between different approaches to genomic data representation, with the overall assembly context remaining unspecified.
