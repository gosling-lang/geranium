Based on the provided specifications, the visualization consists of two tracks arranged vertically in a linear layout, depicting genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500.

The top track is a bar chart displaying genomic intervals on the x-axis. Expression values are represented by the height of the bars on the y-axis. This chart is stratified by rows representing four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each category is represented by a different color, with black strokes outlining the bars.

The bottom track is an area chart, also showcasing genomic intervals on the x-axis. Expression values are visualized through the filled area on the y-axis. This track maintains the same categorical stratification as the bar chart, with colors depicting each sample and white strokes outlining the area chart.

Both charts include tooltips providing genomic positions and expression values for each sample, and the data is derived from a multivec file hosted online. The specification is based on hg38 assembly with interactive features for detailed exploration.
