The visualization consists of two stacked linear charts focusing on a multivec file. The top track is a bar chart showcasing genomic intervals from chromosome 1 (positions 1 to 3,000,500). Expression values are depicted with bars, where the height of each bar is dictated by the 'peak_min' and 'peak_max' values. Categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4' are displayed in separate rows and color-coded with blue, orange, green, and red, respectively.

The bottom track is an area chart reflecting genomic intervals along the same chromosomal region. It shows expression values as filled areas. The categories are similarly stratified and colored as in the bar chart. Both charts enhance interpretability through interactive tooltips that display detailed genomic positions and expression values. The overall layout is vertical, allowing for a comprehensive view of the genomic data.
