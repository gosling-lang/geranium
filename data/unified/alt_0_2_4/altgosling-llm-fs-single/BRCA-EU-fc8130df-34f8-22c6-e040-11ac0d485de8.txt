The visualization is composed of two views, arranged vertically, linking a circular and a linear layout. The circular view displays an ideogram, chromosome markers, and tracks for genomic data on a complete genome scale. Key tracks include 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in blue and orange, respectively, as well as connections indicating structural variations such as 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' and 'Deletion' using variable colors and lines. An interactive blue brush connects the circular and linear views, focusing on chromosome 1 in the linear section.

The linear view drills down to chromosome 1, showcasing multiple tracks such as gene annotations, putative drivers in black text, and point mutations depicted by colorful dots in a scatter plot. Each point mutation is categorized by mutation subtype, indicated by color. Additional linear tracks display insertion and deletion events, and copy number variants as gray rectangles. The view concludes with range annotations highlighting 'Gain' and 'LOH,' using distinct color schemes consistent with the circular view. This multifaceted genomic visualization integrates CSV and VCF data to provide detailed structural and mutational insights.
