A linear view visualization depicts genomic data from chromosome 1, between 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. It consists of seven charts: four rectangle charts and three connection charts. The rectangles are colored pink, purple, and green, representing genomic intervals, while the connections link these intervals. These elements are visually distinguished by differing color codes: pink for the top track, purple in the middle, and green at the bottom, with a stroke color of #4C6629 and an opacity of 0.15. The visualization uses a CSV file from a specified URL and highlights genomic positions with interactive tooltips.
