A linear heat map displays a multivec file, visualizing genomic intervals on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The color intensity encodes expression values across four samples. The rows represent different samples, and the color range is based on a quantitate field named 'peak,' using a hot color scheme. This visualization includes a genomic scale on the x-axis and color legend for intensity values.
