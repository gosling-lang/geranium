A vertically arranged linear layout depicts four genomic tracks representing different BED file specifications, spanning chromosome 1 from 1 to 2,000,000. Each track visualizes data using rectangles with consistent height and stroke. The first track, titled 'BED12: All 12 standard fields,' displays purple rectangles. The second track, 'BED6: A file with the first 6 BED fields,' uses pink rectangles. The third track, 'BED6+6: A file with the first 6 BED fields, and 6 custom fields,' also shows pink rectangles but with custom field positioning. The fourth track, 'BED12+1: A file with all 12 standard fields, and a single extra custom field,' features green rectangles.
