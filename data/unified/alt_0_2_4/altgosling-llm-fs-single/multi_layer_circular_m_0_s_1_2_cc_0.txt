A circular scatter plot visualizes a multivec file, displaying data for chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000 base pairs. The plot includes eight concentric rows, each representing different samples, with points colored according to the sample category. This visualization uses points to encode quantitative values based on the field 'peak', ranging between 0 and 0.01. The track layout is circular with x-axis intervals showing genomic positions and y-axis values as expression levels, without explicit axes for y-values. The eight categories are distinguished by distinct colors, such as blue, orange, green, red, purple, and brown.
