The visualization displays a section of the E. coli genome in a linear layout, specifically from bases 222,000 to 240,000 on chromosome U00096.3. Each gene is represented with arrows indicating the strand direction: rightward triangles for positive and leftward for negative strands. Gene features are annotated with their names and visualized using GFF3 data, classified by gene type such as protein coding, tRNA, and rRNA, each colored differently (e.g., orange, blue, green). The chart's title is "GFF3 file" with a subtitle explaining the genome is colored by gene type, emphasizing the visualization of genetic components based on functional categorization.
