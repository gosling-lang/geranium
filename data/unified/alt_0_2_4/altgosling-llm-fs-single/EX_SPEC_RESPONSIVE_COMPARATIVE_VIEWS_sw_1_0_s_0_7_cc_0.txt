A horizontal arrangement of three linear bar charts visualizes genomic data across chromosomes 9 and 12 in the hg38 assembly. Each chart represents a segment ranging from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000 base pairs. The data is sourced from a multivec file, focusing on a single category named 'sample 1'. The 'peak' data field determines the bar height, reflecting quantitative values, while bars are colored sky blue with white strokes of 0.5 width. The layout is responsive horizontally, aligning with a linking ID for interactivity.
