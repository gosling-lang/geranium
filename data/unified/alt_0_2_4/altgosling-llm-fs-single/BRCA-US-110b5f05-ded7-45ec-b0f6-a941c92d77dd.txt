The visualization presents a combination of circular and linear layouts, displaying the hg19 assembly. It features a circular ideogram of the entire genome with blue interactive brush links, connecting the circular and linear views. The circular view includes five tracks: an ideogram, a point annotation track titled 'Putative Driver,' two range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' (blue rectangles) and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' (red rectangles), and a line-connection track. The line-connection track illustrates various structural variations like 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion' with different colors for each category. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, consisting of a detailed ideogram, annotation tracks, a scatterplot for point mutations, and tracks for insertions, deletions, and copy number variants. The scatterplot visualizes VCF data, displaying the 'SUBTYPE' with colored points. The entire visualization employs interactive features, including mouse events for detailed data inspection.
