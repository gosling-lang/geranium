A linear genomic visualization titled "Basic Marks: Rect" depicts chromosomal banding patterns. The track represents chromosome 1, highlighting different stain categories as colored rectangles along the x-axis. The x-axis is marked at chromosomal intervals, with colors indicating various genomic stain types like gneg, gpos, and gvar. The chart has a white outline, gray strokes, and thin stroke widths, emphasizing distinct stain bands without acen type. The subtitle is "Tutorial Examples," providing basic educational context.
