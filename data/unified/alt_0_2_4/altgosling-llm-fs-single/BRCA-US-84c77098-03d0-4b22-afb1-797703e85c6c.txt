A circular and linear genome visualization display related genomic data from the hg19 assembly. The circular section features an ideogram showing chromosomal bands, with a blue brush tool linked to the linear view's chromosome 1 region. It includes tracks for 'Putative Driver' annotations in text, 'Gain' in blue rectangles, 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange rectangles, and connections color-coded by structural variations like 'Translocation', 'Duplication', and 'Inversion'. The linear section extends these details into tracks for point mutations like 'C>A', 'Copy Number Variants', and rows showing 'Insertion' and 'Deletion', visualized as colored points and rectangles. Genomic annotations appear in black text, with data transitions visualized through linking lines. The whole visualization enables dynamic interaction with genomic locations and complex data overlays.
