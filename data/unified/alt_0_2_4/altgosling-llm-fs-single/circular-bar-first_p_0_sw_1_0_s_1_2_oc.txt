A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec dataset, focusing on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The layout is vertical within a static circular view, depicting genomic positions on the x-axis. The chart features four samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4') represented by bars, their colors corresponding to categorical data. Peaks of genomic expression are shown on the y-axis with grid lines for clarity. The inner radius is set at 105, and the outer radius at 210, enhancing aesthetics. A legend facilitates category identification. Tooltips provide additional data details like start and end positions, peak value, and sample name.
