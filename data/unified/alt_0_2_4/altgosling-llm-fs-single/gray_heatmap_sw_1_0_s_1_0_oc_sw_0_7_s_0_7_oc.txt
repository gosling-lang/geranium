The visualization depicts a heatmap in a linear layout, illustrating a genomic matrix file within the context of the hg38 assembly. The x and y axes represent genomic intervals, and the expression values are encoded using varying intensities of the color grey. The heatmap is static and oriented horizontally, with the top axis displaying genomic intervals on the x-axis and the left axis on the y-axis. The visualization is defined by a HiGlass matrix dataset, with the specified dimensions of 226 by 310 pixels.
