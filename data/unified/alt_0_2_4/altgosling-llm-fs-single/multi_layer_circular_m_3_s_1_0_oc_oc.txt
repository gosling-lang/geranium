A circular bar chart in a circular layout visualizes a multivec file, depicting chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. This chart has multiple rows, each representing different samples such as 'sample 1', 'sample 2', and 'sample 3', among othersâ€”excluding 'sample -'. The heights of the bars indicate quantitative expression values measured by the 'peak' data field. Each row is colored differently to indicate categories, with distinct colors assigned to each sample.
