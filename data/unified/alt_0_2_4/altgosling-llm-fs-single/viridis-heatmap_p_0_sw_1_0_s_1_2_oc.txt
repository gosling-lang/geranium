A linear heatmap visualization arranged vertically displays genomic data for chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. The chart shows expression values encoded by color intensity, with the x-axis representing genomic intervals and the y-axis stratified by samples. There are four rows for 'sample 1' through 'sample 4,' and color intensity reflects quantitative values from a multivec file. The layout is part of the hg38 assembly, with interactive elements displayed for genomic start and end positions.
