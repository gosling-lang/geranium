The visualization, titled "Basic Marks: Triangles," presents a genomic track with triangle marks in a linear layout. This track uses data from a BEDDB file, displaying gene annotations with right and left triangles to represent genomic start and end points. The chart is stratified by strand, with colors corresponding to either positive (blue) or negative (orange) strands. The triangles indicate gene direction and are sized consistently across the visualization, enhancing clarity. The subtitle "Tutorial Examples" provides context as an educational demonstration.
