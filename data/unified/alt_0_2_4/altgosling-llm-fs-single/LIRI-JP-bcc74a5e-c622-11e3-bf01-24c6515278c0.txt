This visualization consists of a circular and linear view. The circular view presents the entire genome using an ideogram, a point annotation track titled "Putative Driver," and two range annotation tracks labeled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)." The range annotations are visualized with rectangles in sky blue and dark orange, respectively. A line-connection track displays structural variations, including translocations and duplications, indicated by different colors based on the category 'svclass.'

A blue interactive brush links the views, with the linear view zooming into chromosome 1 from the circular view. In the linear view, tracks include detailed annotation, such as gene annotations with triangles marking gene boundaries and connecting lines. The "Point Mutation" scatterplot displays positions in color-coded points according to the 'SUBTYPE,' describing various point mutations. Additional tracks include "Insertion" and "Deletion" annotations, represented with rectangles in yellow and green, and "Copy Number Variants" shown in gray. These views collectively illustrate an integrated analysis of genomic data using multiple data types and visual encodings.
