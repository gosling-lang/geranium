The visualization titled "Visual Linking" demonstrates interactive genomic data analysis, allowing users to change the position and range of brushes to update a detailed view. The layout is vertical and features two primary views: a linear scatter plot and a combined linear and circular overview. 

1. **Linear Scatter Plot**: Located at the top, it displays genomic data for chromosome 1 between 160,000,000 and 200,000,000. Points represent peak values on the y-axis, stratified by samples (sample 1 to 4) and colored distinctly in blue, orange, green, and red.

2. **Detailed View**: Below, an interactive area and circular line charts represent the entire chromosome 1. The circular chart, static and overlaying, shows peak values with lines and provides an overview of genomic intervals, color-coded similarly. An area chart accompanies it, displaying expressions as filled areas. 

Brushes link both views, ensuring seamless navigation from overview to detail and vice versa, enhancing interactive exploration of the genomic data. The assembly used is hg38, reflecting the genome version.
