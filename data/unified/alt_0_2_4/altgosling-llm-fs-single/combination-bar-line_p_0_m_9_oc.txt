The visualization consists of two stacked charts displaying genomic data on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top chart is an area plot showing expression levels on the y-axis, with different colors representing four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The bottom chart is an overlay of line and area plots, stratified by sample rows, using the same categories and colors. Height encoding is used to represent expression values, with additional information provided via tooltips. Both charts are interactive and share the same x-axis for genomic positions, offering a comparative view of expression patterns across samples.
