A circular line chart in a circular layout visualizes multiple time series, spanning chromosome 12 from positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The data is stratified into rows, each representing a different sample category, excluding those labeled 'sample -'. Lines of varying colors correspond to different categories, while the y-axis indicates expression values ranging from 0 to 0.01. The chart features multiple tracks with overlapping lines, where opacity varies to enhance clarity. This visualization is associated with Javed et al.'s study on graphical perception of time series, offering insights into genomic data trends across samples.
