The visualization presents a horizontal matrix layout comparing Micro-C and Hi-C data for HFFc6 cells across chromosome 7 from 77,700,000 to 81,000,000 base pairs. It includes two main views with a total of 19 tracks featuring bar charts and genomic annotations.

In the left view, bar charts depict the HFFc6_H3K4me3 and HFFc6_ATAC data, shown as peaks against a dark green and orange background, respectively. Overlaid bars and triangular annotations represent gene annotations, with navy-blue bars for the HFFc6_CTCF data and genic strand markers in pink and green triangles. Below these, a matrix chart shows the HFFc6_Micro-C interactions with color intensity: darker hues indicate higher interaction values.

On the right view, similar tracks illustrate HFFc6_Hi-C data. The Epilogos (hg38) track at the bottom uses multicolored bars to indicate different chromatin states within the same genomic intervals.

The visualization uses different colors to distinguish between data types and features, with the main genomic data encoded through color intensity and bar height. The overall styling features a light gray background for clarity.
