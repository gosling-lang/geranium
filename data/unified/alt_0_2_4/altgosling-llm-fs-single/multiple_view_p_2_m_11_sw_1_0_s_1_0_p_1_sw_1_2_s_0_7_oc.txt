The visualization consists of three interconnected charts displaying genomic data on chromosome 1. The main chart is a scatter plot with points color-coded by category, representing genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Below it, a horizontal arrangement features an area chart with overlapping data series, each colored by category, and uses a brush for interactive selection within the genomic interval. Adjacent to this is a circular line chart, also color-coded by category, with lines representing expression across genomic intervals. This chart includes a brush linked to the detail view. The visualization's title, "Visual Linking," highlights interactive capabilities, allowing for dynamic exploration of genomic detail by adjusting the brush positions.
