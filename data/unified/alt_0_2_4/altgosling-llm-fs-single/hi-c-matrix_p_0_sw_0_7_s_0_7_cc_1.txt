A Hi-C matrix in a linear layout visualizes genomic interactions using a matrix representation, highlighting a region between 800,000,000 and 1,800,000,000 base pairs. The visualization includes multiple overlaid tracks: a bar matrix track with color intensity representing expression values, vertical and horizontal pink lines for genomic positions, additional bar annotations with stroke color denoting different categories, and a point annotation track using size to denote expression levels. The hot color range is used to differentiate quantitative data values. The matrix is styled with a dashed outline and has a light gray background. The title is "Hi-C Matrix," with the subtitle "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations."
