A circular and a linear view are stacked vertically, linked by a blue brush tool in the circular ideogram. The circular view provides a genomic overview with five tracks: an ideogram, a text track for 'Putative Driver,' and three range annotation tracks for 'Gain' (sky blue) and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' (dark orange), as well as structural variations. The linear view zooms into chromosome 1 and shows similar tracks plus additional details like gene annotations and mutational insights. A scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' highlights varying colors based on mutation subtypes, while range annotations present 'Insertions' and 'Deletions' in distinct hues. The tracks representing Copy Number Variants use gray bars to display quantitative data. The visualization effectively combines interactive and detailed layers for in-depth genomic analysis.
