A circular bar chart displays a multivec dataset spanning chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The chart uses a vertical arrangement with a center radius of 0.5. It includes a bar track where the x-axis represents genomic positions, and the y-axis represents quantitative peak values. Each bar's color varies across four categories: 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4,' with a legend for category identification. This visualization is static and set within a defined interval on the chromosome, showing expression data as bar heights.
