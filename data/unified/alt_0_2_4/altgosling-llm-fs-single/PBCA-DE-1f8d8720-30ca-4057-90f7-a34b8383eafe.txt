The visualization comprises a circular and a linear view aligned vertically. The circular view encapsulates the whole genome with highlighted annotations across several tracks: an ideogram, a text track for putative drivers, colored rectangle tracks to depict gains and losses, and connection tracks indicating structural variations. These connections, distinguished by color, represent categories like 'Gain,' 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.'

An interactive blue brush in the circular view links to the linear view, which focuses on a specific chromosome region. The linear view mirrors the data types of the circular view and adds detailed genomic features such as a gene annotation track, scatterplot, and variant tracks. The scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation' displays mutations with points colored according to 'SUBTYPE.' Copy number variations are shown in gray rectangles, with quantification on the y-axis. This comprehensive configuration aims to present a detailed genomic landscape using multiple data layers.
