The visualization titled "Visual Linking" includes a vertical arrangement of views illustrating interactive genomic data. The top portion comprises a circular bar chart linked to a horizontal bar chart. These charts display data from chromosome 1, with expression values represented by colored bars corresponding to four categories: 'sample 1' (blue), 'sample 2' (orange), 'sample 3' (green), and 'sample 4' (red). The circular view features an interactive brush that updates the detailed linear view below.

The lower linear bar chart details the genomic intervals from 160,000,000 to 200,000,000 on chromosome 1, reflecting the focused range selected by the brush. The visualization uses a multivec file from a specified URL, showing position data on the x-axis and quantitative peaks on the y-axis, with each categorical row color-coded to enhance clarity. The subtitle encourages users to interactively explore the data by adjusting the position and range of the brushes.
