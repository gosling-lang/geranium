A circular visualization displays two tracks side by side. The left track is an area chart with genomic data stratified by samples, using distinct colors for 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' The x-axis shows genomic position, while the y-axis reflects quantitative peak values. The right track is a connection chart illustrating genomic intervals within chromosome 1, from positions 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. This track uses colored connections to represent different categories. The layout centers around a circular arrangement with a static configuration.
