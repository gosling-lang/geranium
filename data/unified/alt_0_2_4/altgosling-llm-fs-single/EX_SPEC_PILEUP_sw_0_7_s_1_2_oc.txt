The visualization consists of two tracks in a linear layout, depicting sequence alignment using a BAM file for chromosome 1, from positions 136,750 to 139,450. The top track shows a coverage bar chart, where the heights represent the number of reads aligned to regions, with bars colored in silver. The bottom track is a pileup chart displaying individual reads in various colors for different structural variations such as 'normal read', 'deletion (+-)', 'inversion (++/-+)', and others. Each color represents a specific category of structural variation. The title is "Pileup Track Using BAM Data".
