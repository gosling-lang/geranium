A visualization featuring a circular and a linear arrangement, showcasing genomic data for hg19. The circular view, titled "Ideogram," includes tracks like point and range annotations. Text tracks display gene information, while range tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' highlight genomic variations. Connections between genome locations are color-coded by categories such as 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.' The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, including tracks for mutations, 'Copy Number Variants,' and annotations with triangles and rectangles representing different genomic features. The scatter plot "Point Mutation" uses color to represent mutation subtypes.
