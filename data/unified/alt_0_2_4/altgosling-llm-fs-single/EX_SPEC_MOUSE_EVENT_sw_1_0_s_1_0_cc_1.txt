The visualization titled "Custom Mouse Events" consists of multiple tracks, each with a distinct focus on genomic data represented through bar charts and an ideogram. The dataset visualizes a multivec file across chromosome 1, with data divided into categories such as "sample 1" to "sample 4." The bar charts titled "Individual Marks," "Group Marks By Sample," and "Group Marks By Genomic Position" exhibit genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Each category is color-coded with a predefined palette.

The track titled "Group Marks By Gene," focused on chromosome 3, displays genomic range annotations with text, showing gene structures and labels. Interactive elements allow for mouse hovering and range selection, featuring styles like blue for hovering and red or purple for selection. The final track, "Group Marks By Chromosome," presents a cytogenetic band ideogram with text and graphical annotations, allowing grouping by chromosome. Mouse events such as hovering and clicking enhance the user interaction experience. This visualization effectively utilizes color, text, and interactivity for comprehensive genomic data representation.
