A circular layered chart visualizes multivec data, focusing on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The chart displays four samples named 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each shown in different colors with lines and points. The size of the points varies based on quantitative data from the 'peak' field, with a range from 0 to 2. The chart uses a circular, vertical layout and is static, enhancing the comparison of genomic positions among samples. A legend is included to distinguish between samples by color.
