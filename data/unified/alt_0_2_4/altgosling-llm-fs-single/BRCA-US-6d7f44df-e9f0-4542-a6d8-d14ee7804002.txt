The visualization consists of two main views, one circular and one linear, aligned vertically. The circular view encompasses an ideogram of the entire genome from assembly hg19, featuring interactive elements with blue brushes. This view includes tracks displaying a "Gain" layer in blue and a "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in orange, alongside connections representing structural variations like translocations, duplications, deletions, and inversions, each uniquely colored according to type.

The linear view complements the circular representation by focusing on chromosome 1. It includes multiple annotation tracks, such as a gene track with labeled exons, a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" highlighting mutations by subtype, and additional tracks depicting insertions and deletions. Color-coded rectangles indicate copy number variations, with quantitative data on "total_cn" demonstrated through varying rectangle heights and grey shading.

Both views are interconnected, allowing synchronized exploration, with axes representing genomic ranges. The styling emphasizes clarity and detail, with annotations and legends providing context. The visualization is a comprehensive tool for genomic data analysis, enabling detailed examination of chromosomal features and variations.
