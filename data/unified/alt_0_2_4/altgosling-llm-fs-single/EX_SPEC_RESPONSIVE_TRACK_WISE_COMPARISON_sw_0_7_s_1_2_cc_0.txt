The visualization features two sets of genomic data tracks arranged vertically. The first set exhibits genomic range annotations and expression profiles for chromosome 12, spanning intervals [10,140,000 to 10,210,000]. It includes a gene annotation track rendered in pink, displaying gene locations with directional arrows and gene names. Below, three bar charts for Samples 1, 2, and 3 display expression levels as green bars.

The second set focuses on chromosome 8, between [127,734,000 and 127,744,000], showcasing expression profiles and gene annotations. The bar charts for Samples 1 and 2 are presented in sky blue, while Sample 3 is in pink. Each bar chart visualizes the expression values along the y-axis, representing quantitative peaks.

The gene track is illustrated in blue with arrows indicating gene directionality. Both sets incorporate linking mechanisms through IDs, allowing interactive navigation between aligned genomic regions. The design employs a responsive layout with consistent spacing, background styling, and visibility settings to ensure clarity across varying display conditions.
