The visualization is a rectangular chart titled "Basic Marks: Rect" displaying chromosome 1 of the hg38 assembly. It employs a linear layout and uses genomic intervals on the x-axis. The different genomic stains are indicated by distinct colored rectangles, associated with a nominal field named "Stain" from a CSV dataset. The chart's subtitle is "Tutorial Examples." Each rectangle's color corresponds to a specific stain category, with colors including blue, orange, green, red, and more. The rectangles have a gray stroke with a width of 0.5, and the chart extends to a width of 560 and a height of 70 pixels. The genomic domain focuses on chromosome 1, enhancing clarity for genomic visualization tasks.
