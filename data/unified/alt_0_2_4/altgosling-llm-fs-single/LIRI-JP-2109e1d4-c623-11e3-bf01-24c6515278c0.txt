A visualization composed of a circular and linear layout displays genomic data of hg19. The circular view contains multiple tracks, including a chromosomal ideogram with an interactive brush, aligning it with the linear view. It features a text with "Putative Driver," and two tracks, "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," highlighted in sky blue and dark orange, respectively. A link track connects genomic positions displaying structural variations in varied colors, representing categories such as "Gain," "LOH," "Translocation," "Duplication," "Deletion," "Inversion (TtT)," and "Inversion (HtH)." The linear view further includes a gene annotation track, a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation," showing distances to previous mutations with points colored by mutation subtype. Plus, there are tracks for "Insertion" and "Deletion," and a "Copy Number Variants" track in gray.
