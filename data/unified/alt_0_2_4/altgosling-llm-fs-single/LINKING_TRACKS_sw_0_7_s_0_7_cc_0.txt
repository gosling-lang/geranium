A linear genomic visualization on chromosome 2, hg38 assembly, consists of two tracks. The top track is a line chart displaying multivec data across three samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. These are visualized with blue, orange, and green lines, respectively. The bottom track is an area chart covering 'sample 1' and 'sample 2' shown in blue and orange. Both tracks use the x-axis for genomic positions and the y-axis to express quantitative peak values, with colors distinguishing samples. The charts are hierarchically organized by sample categories.
