The visualization is a circular plot displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. It shows expressions of four samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4') using both lines and points. The plot employs a multivec data type for representing the peaks, with the peak value influencing the size of the points. Different colors represent each sample, with a legend available for identification. The circular layout has a center radius of 0.5, and the expression values are encoded on the y-axis. The visualization facilitates interactive exploration through tooltips showing detailed information about position, peak value, and sample.
