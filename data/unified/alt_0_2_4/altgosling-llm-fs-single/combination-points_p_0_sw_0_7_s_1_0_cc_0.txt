In this linear layout visualization, two vertically arranged scatter plots display multivec data for chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top scatter plot is stratified by rows for samples 1 to 4, with points depicted using colors—blue, orange, green, and red—representing different samples. The size and position of the points along the y-axis reflect the quantitative 'peak' value.

The bottom scatter plot also represents the 'peak' value but is not stratified by rows. Instead, it combines samples into a single view, still using color to distinguish between them. Both plots feature a grid on the y-axis and use opacity to enhance visualization clarity. Interactive tooltips provide detailed information, including genomic start and end positions, 'peak' values, and sample identifiers.
