A circular bar chart visualizes vector data, representing genomic positions and their associated peak values. The chart is focused on a circular arrangement with a center radius of 0.3, displaying the genome on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis through bars. Each bar is colored pink, providing a stacked alignment view of the data. The visualization uses data from a specified URL, incorporating a genomic x-axis with a quantitative y-axis. The chart is static, with specific dimensions and a defined range, rendering an overview of the genomic dataset in a visually compact form.
