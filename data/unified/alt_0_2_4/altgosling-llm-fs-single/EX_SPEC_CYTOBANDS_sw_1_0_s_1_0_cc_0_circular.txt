A circular visualization in a parallel arrangement illustrates genomic data across chromosomes 1 to 5. Each track displays genomic intervals with an area chart representing expression values, colored categorically. An ideogram overlays each circular layout, featuring band names in black text. Band density is indicated by shades of gray rectangles, while variable regions are highlighted in purple. Centromeres are marked with maroon triangles on both ends. The visualization uses genomic positions for the x-axis and quantitative expression on the y-axis, emphasizing differences among categories with distinct colors. The assembly is hg38.
