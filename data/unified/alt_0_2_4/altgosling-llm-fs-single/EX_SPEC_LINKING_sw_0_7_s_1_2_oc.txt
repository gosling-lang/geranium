The visualization features a vertical arrangement of two primary views linked by interactive brushing. The top view comprises a circular bar chart and a horizontal bar chart. The circular chart shows genomic data for chromosome 1, with bars colored according to categorical values from four samples. The brush is interactive, allowing users to select specific genomic intervals, which are reflected in the details shown in the lower horizontal bar chart. 

The detail view at the bottom displays a linear visualization of a specific region of chromosome 1, defined by the brush. It includes a detailed breakdown of the genomic data with bars representing quantitative values for each sample category. The linking enhancement provides a seamless overview-to-detail exploration of genomic data, effectively illustrating data relationships across different scales and formats. The subtitle, “Change the position and range of brushes to update the detail view on the bottom,” guides the interactive usage of the visualization.
