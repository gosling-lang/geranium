A circular bar chart in a vertical arrangement visualizes a multivec file, depicting the entire human chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The height of the bars represents quantitative data from the field named 'peak,' with categories 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4' differentiated by color. The chart includes a legend describing these sample categories. The static design has a centered radius of 0.5, offering a compact layout around the genome circle. The tooltip displays additional details for each genomic range represented by the bars.
