The visualization comprises a circular ideogram and a detailed linear representation linked by an interactive brush on the circular view. The circular section showcases the entire hg19 genome, highlighting structural variations like 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' with blue and red annotations, respectively. The central circular track displays connections representing different variations such as 'Deletion' and 'Inversion,' using distinct colors for categories like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.' 

The linear view expands the chromosome 1 region, including a text overlay for 'Putative Driver' genes, and a scatter plot displaying 'Point Mutation' data. The scatter plot points, representing mutations, are colored according to 'SUBTYPE.' Below, gain and LOH annotations appear in bars, with explanatory differences marked in shades of blue and orange. The 'Copy Number Variants' track beneath visualizes changes in copy numbers with grey bars delineating the total number of copies in selected genomic intervals. The design employs dynamic styling to accommodate zoom-level changes and ensure clarity across different genomic scales.
