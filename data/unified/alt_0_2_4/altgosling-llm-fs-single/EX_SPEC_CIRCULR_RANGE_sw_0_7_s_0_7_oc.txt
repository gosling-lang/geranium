A circular bar chart in a stack layout displays a vector data file, representing genomic positions across the entire genome of hg38. The height of bars corresponds to a quantitative measure named 'peak,' while the color of the bars is a pale yellow (#EEEDA1). The chart uses a genomic scale on the x-axis and a quantitative scale on the y-axis, with outer and inner radii defining the bounds. The visualization is static with a central radius and spacing creating an organized circular visualization.
