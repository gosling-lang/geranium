A series of three juxtaposed linear bar charts visually encode a multivec file across different genomic intervals. Each chart represents specific genomic regions from chromosome 9 and chromosome 12, spanning the interval 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The first chart displays bars in pink, representing data associated with chromosome 12, using peak values on the y-axis. The second and third charts depict data for chromosome 9 and chromosome 12 respectively, with bars in a light purple hue. All charts share a genomic x-axis, with data dynamically linked through an interactive responsive design tailored for varying screen widths. Each bar chart incorporates a thin white stroke to distinguish individual bars, enhancing visual clarity.
