The visualization consists of an overlaid matrix showing data from chromosome 10, represented on both x- and y-axes. Two tracks are overlaid: the first track displays data in grey using the 'lower-left' style, and the second track uses the 'upper-right' style colored with the viridis color scheme. The expression values are encoded by color intensity. Both tracks share the same width and height, reflecting a focus on genomic interactions. The visualization is interactive and dynamically adjusts its size based on the display width, optimizing the view for screens wider than 1000 pixels. Data is sourced from matrix files, each linked by a common identifier, allowing for synchronized exploration of the genomic intervals shown.
