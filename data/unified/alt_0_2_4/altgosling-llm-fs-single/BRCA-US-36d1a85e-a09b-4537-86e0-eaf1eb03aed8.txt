A visualization featuring a circular and linear genomic layout. The circular view contains five tracks: an ideogram, text annotations, two genomic range annotations titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' and a connections track showing structural variations. Intervals on the genome are linked with colored connections representing 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion' events. The circular ideogram includes a blue brush linking to the linear view.

The linear view consists of nine tracks, showcasing detailed insights into chromosome 1. It includes:
- An ideogram with left and right triangles indicating segment boundaries.
- A detailed text annotation track titled 'Putative Driver.'
- A scatter plot called 'Point Mutation,' with points colored by categories such as 'C>A' and 'C>T.'
- A genomic range annotation track for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion,' displayed in yellow and green respectively.
- A 'Copy Number Variants' chart featuring linear bars with quantitative data represented in shades of gray.
- Additional genomic interactions illustrated through horizontal and vertical lines.

The views are intricately linked, enabling seamless exploration of genomic coordinates, mutations, and structural variations across the circular and linear representations, with detailed categorical color encoding providing quick insights.
