A linear genomic range annotation chart visualizes a BED file for chromosome 3, from positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. The chart displays data as horizontal bars representing genes, exons, and introns. Genes and introns are colored in pink, while exons are highlighted in green. The chart is divided into two rows based on strand orientation, denoted by '+' and '-'. Each feature is outlined in gray, emphasizing its region. The layout is horizontal, aligned vertically with width 350 and height 130 on assembly hg38.
