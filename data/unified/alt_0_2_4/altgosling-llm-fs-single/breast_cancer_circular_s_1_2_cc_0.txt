A circular ideogram visualization depicts genomic data from hg38. The outermost track shows a band of colors representing genomic intervals, with purple and green rectangles highlighting specific features such as copy number variations in tumors. The purple rectangles indicate regions with zero minor copy number in the tumor, while green rectangles indicate regions with total copy numbers ranging from 4.5 to 900 in the tumor. The inner track contains colored connections denoting structural variants, including tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions. The connections are varied in color and stroke, providing a comprehensive view of genomic variations.
