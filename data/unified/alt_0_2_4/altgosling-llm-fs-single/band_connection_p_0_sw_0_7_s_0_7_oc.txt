The visualization is a linear genome browser layout displaying genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. The data is from a CSV file focusing on segmental duplications. It consists of a total of seven tracks: four tracks with rectangles and three connection tracks. Each track uses a green color scheme with a low opacity of 0.15 for visual clarity.

- The rectangle tracks mark genomic intervals using rectangular bars, with each bar representing a unique genomic segment. 
- The connection tracks illustrate relationships between segments using green lines linking pairs of genomic positions. 
- Both types of tracks share a consistent style, with thin strokes of width 0.8 displayed in a light green color (#85B348).
- Tooltips provide additional context by showing genomic start and end positions for each segment in a distinctive green text color.
  
This setup effectively demonstrates repetitive sequence alignments and emphasizes segmental duplications within the defined genomic range using visual connections.
