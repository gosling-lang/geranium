A visualization featuring circular and linear views showcases genomic data in a vertically arranged linear layout. The circular view includes a genome ideogram across its outermost track, highlighted by a blue interactive brush linking to the linear view's chromosome 1. Inside, it has tracks for a 'Putative Driver' annotation, a 'Gain' range annotation in blue, a 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' range annotation in orange, and a link track depicting genomic structural variations like 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversions', represented in different colors. The linear view starts with an ideogram of chromosome 1, followed by tracks for putative drivers, point mutations visualized as scatterplots with various colored points representing mutation subtypes, and range annotations for insertions and deletions. Finally, there is a copy number variant track with gray rectangles. The layout effectively allows for detailed genomic examination, with interactive elements enhancing exploration.
