A multicolored circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file spanning chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. It is configured to adapt between circular and linear layouts based on aspect ratio, showing multiple samples across different tracks. Each bar represents genomic data, with colors denoting different sample categories. The chart is stratified by rows for these categories, adjusting opacity and y-domain scaling to accommodate varying heights. This visualization references "Graphical perception of Multiple Time Series" by Javed et al., illustrating responsive design in visualizing genomic intervals.
