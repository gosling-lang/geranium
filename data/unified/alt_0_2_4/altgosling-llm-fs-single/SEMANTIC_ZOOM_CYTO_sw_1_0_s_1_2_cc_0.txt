The visualization showcases a semantic zooming feature within a linear layout, displaying an ideogram of the human genome (assembly hg38). The chart is titled "Example: Semantic Zooming" with the subtitle indicating that text and triangle marks will appear upon zooming in for additional details. The x-axis represents chromosomes, with each chromosome region visualized as a rectangle. Chromosome positions are denoted by the fields "chromStart" and "chromEnd." Rectangles vary in color based on categorical attributes: chromosomes are colored in shades of gray, while regions are distinguished by stain categories in colors ranging from white to black.

Additional markers include text labels for chromosome bands and maroon triangles indicating special regions ("acen") that point right for 'q' and left for 'p'. The visualization dynamically reveals more details at different zoom levels, allowing an in-depth exploration of chromosomal structures.
