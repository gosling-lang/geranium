The visualization is a vertically arranged, multi-layer plot in a linear layout. It depicts four samples across chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. Each sample is displayed in separate rows with lines and points indicating the genomic position (x-axis) and expression values (y-axis). The lines represent continuous genomic data, while the points vary in size based on the quantitative 'peak' value they represent. Each line and corresponding points are color-coded (blue, orange, green, red) based on the sample category. The plot includes tooltips providing detailed information about genomic positions, expression values, and sample categories.
