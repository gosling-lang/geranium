The visualization shows a genomic data representation titled "Visual Linking," featuring an interactive design with three main components. At the top, a scatter plot displays chromosome 1 between 160,000,000 and 200,000,000 base pairs. Points represent expression values stratified by categories, indicated by different colors such as orange, teal, blue, and pink. 

Below, a circular line chart provides an overview, with the entire range of chromosome 1 displayed. Lines represent data trends, with categories differentiated by color. This chart includes a brush interaction that links to other charts, allowing users to refine their view.

To the right, an area chart shows expression values with regions highlighted by different colors corresponding to categories. Here, the brush interaction from the circular chart updates the detail view, enabling users to explore specific genomic intervals further.

The arrangement emphasizes dynamic interaction, with the circular chart allowing real-time updates of the linear detail view based on selected genomic ranges. The charts' stratification by category enables focused analysis of selected data segments.
