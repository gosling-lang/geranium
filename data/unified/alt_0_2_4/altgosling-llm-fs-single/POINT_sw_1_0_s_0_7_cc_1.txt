The visualization is a scatter plot in a linear layout that displays a multivec file of the complete genome of hg38. The genomic positions are represented on the x-axis, while the y-axis encodes quantitative expression values, denoted by 'peak'. The size of each point also represents the 'peak' value, enhancing the data's visibility. The scatter plot uses a sky blue color for the points. The visualization is titled "Basic Marks: point" with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples."
