A circular area chart visualizing a multivec dataset, focusing on chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart contains multiple tracks with opacity variations, displaying quantitative data from the field 'peak' along the y-axis with separate domains for each range. Different rows represent categories based on samples, excluding 'sample -'. Colors encode different samples across 16 layers, without a legend display. The chart is constructed in a circular layout with a linking mechanism for genomic positions, fostering interaction and engagement.
