The visualization is a linear bar chart showing genomic data from chromosome 1, within the interval from 1 to 3,000,500. It uses multi-layer bars to represent expression levels from four different samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is depicted in a distinct color. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis shows quantitative expression values, with a grid for reference. The chart includes a tooltip that provides details on the start and end position, peak value, and sample name, enhancing interactivity. The layout is vertical with a center radius set to 0.8, designed in the hg38 assembly.
