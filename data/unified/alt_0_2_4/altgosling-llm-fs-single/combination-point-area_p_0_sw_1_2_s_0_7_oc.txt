The visualization consists of two vertically arranged tracks displaying genomic data for chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500 in a linear layout. The top track is a scatter plot representing expression values with points whose position, size, and color are determined by the genomic position, peak value, and sample category, respectively. The points are semi-transparent and colored by sample, facilitating the identification of different sample categories. The bottom track is an area chart, where genomic expression is shown by the area size. Each sample category is displayed in a separate row, with areas filled in distinct colors to match the corresponding sample category. The visualization includes interactive tooltips providing detailed information on genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample categories. The tracks are linked, sharing a common genomic x-axis.
