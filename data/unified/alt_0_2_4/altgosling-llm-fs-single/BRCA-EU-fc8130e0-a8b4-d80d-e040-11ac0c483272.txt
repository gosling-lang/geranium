A visualization consisting of a circular and a linear view displays genomic data with chromosome details from hg19. In the circular view, an ideogram track outlines chromosome positions with color-coded rectangles indicating different categories. Overlaid onto this is a text annotation track for 'Putative Driver' and multiple circular tracks for 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)', using blue and orange rectangles respectively. Connections between genomic positions are depicted by lines, with color and stroke varying by categories such as 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion'. The linear view expands into the region detailed on chromosome 1, featuring an ideogram, and text for 'Putative Driver'. A scatter plot labeled 'Point Mutation' illustrates VCF data, each point colored by mutation type. Additional tracks reveal insertions and deletions with rectangles, and a track titled 'Copy Number Variants' visualizes CSV data as gray rectangles. An interactive brush in the circular view links the two visualizations, enhancing the exploration of genomic variations.
