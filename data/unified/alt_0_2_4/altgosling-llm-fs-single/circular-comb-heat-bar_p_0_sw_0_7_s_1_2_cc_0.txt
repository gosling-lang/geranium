The visualization displays two circular charts arranged vertically. The left chart features a circular heat map that encodes genomic data on the x-axis in intervals, with color intensity representing expression values. The chart is stratified into rows based on categories. The right chart is a circular bar chart where the x-axis also represents genomic data, and bars on the y-axis depict expression levels. Each row corresponds to a category indicated by the color of the bars. Both charts use a multivec dataset and focus on chromosome 1, covering an interval from 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. The tracks in each chart are differentiated by samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4'), visualizing variations through distinct colors.
