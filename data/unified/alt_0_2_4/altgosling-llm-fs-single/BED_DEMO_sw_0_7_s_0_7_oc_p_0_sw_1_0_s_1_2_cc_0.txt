A vertical, linear visualization composed of four tracks represents different BED file specifications on chromosome 1, ranging from 1 to 2,000,000. The first track, "BED12: All 12 standard fields," displays genomic intervals with green rectangles. The second track, "BED6: A file with the first 6 BED fields," uses sky blue rectangles for intervals. The third track, "BED6+6: A file with the first 6 BED fields, and 6 custom fields," also uses sky blue rectangles, showcasing additional custom fields. The final track, "BED12+1: A file with all 12 standard fields, and a single extra custom field," mirrors the sky blue color and structure of genomic intervals. This demonstration showcases the utility of BED files for genomic data representation.
