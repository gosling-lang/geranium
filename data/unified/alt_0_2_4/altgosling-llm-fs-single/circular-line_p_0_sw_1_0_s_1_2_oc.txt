A circular visualization in a vertical arrangement shows genomic data from chromosome 1 (1 to 3,000,500 bp) for four samples. The chart includes circular line and scatter plots, with the genome on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Points and line colors correspond to 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each with distinct hues. The point size reflects expression levels, enhancing value comparison. Interactive tooltips offer detailed insights into genomic positions, peak values, and sample categories. The layout utilizes static, circular encoding for compact and continuous genomic region representation.
