The visualization consists of a vertical arrangement with two main views: a circular and a linear view linked by an interactive brush. The circular view presents the entire genome using the hg19 assembly, featuring five tracks: an ideogram (highlighted by a blue brush), a point annotation track visualizing CSV data in black text, and two range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' shown in sky blue and dark orange, respectively. A line-connection track displays genomic interactions with colored lines representing structural variations such as 'Translocation' and 'Inversion.'

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and includes similar tracks: an ideogram, a gene annotation track labeled 'Putative Driver' with text annotations, and a scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation' indicating mutation distances with color-coded points representing mutation subtypes. Additional range annotation tracks display insertions and deletions in separate rows with yellow and green rectangles, and 'Copy Number Variants' visualized as gray bars. The chart integrates interactive elements, such as clicking and mouseover, enhancing the exploration of genomic data.
