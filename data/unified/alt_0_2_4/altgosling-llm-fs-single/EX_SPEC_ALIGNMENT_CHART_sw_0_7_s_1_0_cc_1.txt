The visualization consists of two main views in a vertical linear layout, detailing genomic alignment data. The first view has three tracks: a bar chart titled "Gap," colored in green, representing gap data along genomic intervals on the x-axis, with quantitative values on the y-axis; a bar chart titled "Conservation," utilizing a color gradient to depict conservation intensity across genomic intervals; and a rectilinear chart with colored rectangles and text representing genomic sequences, stratified by categories. Colors denote different sequence categories, with text in black indicating base pairs.

The second view is an overlay of multiple tracks: a chart with rectangles depicting genomic sequences, followed by overlaid bar charts for conservation and gap data across the entire genomic range. A translucent blue interactive brush allows linking and exploration between views, emphasizing alignment regions, zooming into specific sections. The data is sourced via CSV from an external server, and the entire setup is styled with a light gray outline for visual organization.
