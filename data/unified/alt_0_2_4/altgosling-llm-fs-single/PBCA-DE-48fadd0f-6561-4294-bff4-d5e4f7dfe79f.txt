A visualization displaying the human genome assembly for hg19 in a circular view linked to a linear view. The circular view features five tracks: an ideogram, text annotations for putative drivers, a gain annotation track in blue, a loss of heterozygosity annotation track in orange, and connections representing various structural variations, including translocations and duplications. The linear view expands chromosome 1 with additional tracks: an ideogram, putative driver annotations, point mutations color-coded by subtype, and genomic range annotations for insertions and deletions. A range track shows copy number variations, with light grey rectangles indicating the frequency of variants. The views are interconnected, allowing for exploration and detailed inspection of genomic data.
