The visualization is a linear layout featuring coverage and pileup tracks using BAM data. It spans chromosome 1 between positions 136,750 and 139,450. The top track, a bar chart, shows coverage with the height of bars representing the number of reads aligned in each region, colored silver. The bottom track, a pileup chart, displays individual reads as rectangles, stratified by rows for different structural variation categories. Variations such as 'normal read', 'deletion', 'inversion', 'duplication', 'more than two mates', and 'clipping' are depicted in distinct colors, as shown in the legend titled "Insert Size = 300bp". The title of the chart is "Pileup Track Using BAM Data".
