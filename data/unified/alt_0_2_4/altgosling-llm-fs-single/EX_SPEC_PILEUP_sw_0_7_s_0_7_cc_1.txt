The visualization, titled "Pileup Track Using BAM Data," presents coverage and pileup tracks in a linear layout. It uses a BAM file to display data for chromosome 1 between positions 136,750 and 139,450. The top track is a bar chart representing read coverage, with bars colored in silver. Below, the pileup track displays individual reads as rectangles, stratified by rows, and uses colors to differentiate the structural variations within the data, including types like 'normal read', 'deletion (+-)', 'inversion (++)', 'inversion (--)', 'duplication (-+)', 'more than two mates', 'mates not found within chromosome', and 'clipping'. The legend indicates these categories, and the pileup rows are padded to accommodate the variable insert sizes, up to a maximum of 300 base pairs.
