The visualization is a comprehensive genomic representation divided into a circular and a linear view. The circular view covers the full genome with tracks including an ideogram, text annotations, and variation annotations like "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)." The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, displaying similar tracks in detail. Genomic positions are identified, and variations are marked with colors: blue for "Gain," and orange for "LOH." Connections indicate structural variations such as translocations and deletions, each with distinct colors and strokes. Data interactions are facilitated by a brush linking between views.
