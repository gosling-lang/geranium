The visualization features a circular and linear layout, presenting genomic data from the hg19 assembly. The circular view includes an ideogram, putative driver annotations, gain and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) tracks, and structural variation connections such as translocations and inversions. The linear view complements this with detailed annotations of chromosome 1, showcasing tracks for putative drivers, point mutations, insertions, deletions, and copy number variants. Color coding distinguishes categories like 'Gain' in blue, 'LOH' in orange, and various structural variations. An interactive brush links the circular and linear views, enhancing exploration of genomic information.
