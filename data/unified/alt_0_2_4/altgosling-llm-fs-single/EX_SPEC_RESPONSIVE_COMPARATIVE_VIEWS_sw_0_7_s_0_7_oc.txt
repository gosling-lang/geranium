The visualization consists of three bar charts, each representing genomic intervals on different chromosomes. Each chart spans from position 5,000,000 to 15,000,000 on its respective chromosome. The first chart shows data for chromosome 12, with bars colored in navy blue. The second chart presents data for chromosome 9, with bars in orange. The final chart returns to chromosome 12, with bars in dark yellow. Each bar's height corresponds to quantitative data for the "peak" field, with white stroke outlining the bars. The layout is in a vertical arrangement, ensuring that as the viewport width changes, the charts stack accordingly. These visualizations display data using a multivec file, showcasing different expression levels across the specified genomic intervals.
