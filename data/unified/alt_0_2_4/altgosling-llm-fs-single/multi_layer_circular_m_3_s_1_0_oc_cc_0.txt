The visualization is a circular bar chart showing a genomic range from chromosome 12, spanning from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The circular layout consists of multiple rows, each representing a different data category, termed 'samples'. The rows are color-coded distinctively using a palette including blue, orange, green, red, purple, and brown. Each bar's height corresponds to the quantitative value of 'peak', representing expression levels. The dataset originated from a multivec file accessed via a URL. The chart's dimensions are 800x800, it features a central radius of 0.3, and employs a filtering transformation to exclude certain samples.
