A linear layout visualization shows genomic duplication data from chromosome 1 between 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. It consists of multiple tracks using CSV data. Rectangles and links illustrate genomic intervals. Rectangles are colored in sky blue, pink, and purple, indicating different sets of data. The links connect the intervals across tracks, with strokes in similar shades. Opacity provides a layered, transparent view for overlap visualization, with the stroke color adding structure to this representation.
