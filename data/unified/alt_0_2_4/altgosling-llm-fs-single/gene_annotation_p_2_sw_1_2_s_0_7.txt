A horizontal layout visualizes the genomic region of chromosome 3 from 52,168,000 to 52,890,000 using six different tracks. Each track provides a unique view of gene annotations.

1. **Cyverse-QUBES Track**: This track features a genomic range annotation with gene names in black text. Directional indicators are represented by gray triangles, light gray rectangles for genes, and purple rectangles for exons.

2. **Basic Genomic Range Annotation**: Displays genes as gray rectangles. The track is stratified by strand orientation.

3. **GmGDV Track**: Gene names are shown in blue and red based on strand direction, with triangles and rectangles encoding gene structures. Exons are indicated with rectangular markers.

4. **HiGlass Track**: Displays gene information using directional triangles and text, with strand-specific coloring in light blue and light red.

5. **IGV Track**: Uses navy text and rectangles for gene representation, with white dashed directional lines.

6. **Corces et al. Track**: Combines text and rectangle markers to show gene annotations, with distinct colors for strands (blue for positive, red for negative).

The visualization effectively conveys gene distribution and orientation across different representations for the specified genomic interval.
