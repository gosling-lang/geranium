A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file, showing data for chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000 using the hg38 assembly. The chart consists of multiple concentric rows, each representing different samples labeled as 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 6', 'sample 7', and 'sample 8'. Bars within each row encode quantitative values from a field named 'peak'. Each sample is represented in a distinct color, including shades of blue, orange, green, red, purple, and brown, providing a visual differentiation. The layout is oriented horizontally, with a center radius of 0.3, covering a circular area with outer and inner radii of 400 and 120 pixels, respectively.
