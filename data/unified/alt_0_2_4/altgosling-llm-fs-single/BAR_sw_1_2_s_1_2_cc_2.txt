A linear bar chart displays genomic data from a multivec file, focusing on sampled data across the entire hg38 genome assembly. The x-axis is divided into genomic intervals, while the y-axis represents quantitative values from the 'peak' field. Bars are uniformly colored in light purple, with a standardized size of 5 units. The chart is titled 'Basic Marks: bar' with the subtitle 'Tutorial Examples', and it spans a width of 1152 pixels and a height of 246 pixels.
