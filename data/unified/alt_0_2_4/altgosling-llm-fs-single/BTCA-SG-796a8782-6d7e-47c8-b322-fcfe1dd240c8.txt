A visualization featuring two views: a circular and a linear genomic view. The circular view displays the entire hg19 genome, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1, linked by an interactive blue brush. 

The circular view has five tracks:
1. An ideogram with a blue brush.
2. A text annotation track titled "Putative Driver."
3. Two genomic range tracks: "Gain" in sky blue rectangles and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in dark orange rectangles.
4. A line-connection track visualizing structural variations with categories like 'Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversions' in various colors.

The linear view includes nine tracks:
1. An ideogram with left and right triangles.
2. A text annotation track titled "Putative Driver."
3. Vertical lines as chromosome boundaries.
4. A gene annotation track.
5. A scatter plot titled "Point Mutation," using a VCF file with points colored by mutation subtype.
6. A range annotation track showing 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' rows from a VCF file with yellow and green rectangles.
7. A bar track for Copy Number Variants from a CSV file, colored light grey.
8. Two additional genomic range tracks for "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" with corresponding colors.

This visualization effectively compares structural variations and other genomic data across different regions and types.
