The visualization titled "Example: Semantic Zooming" features a linear layout demonstrating semantic zooming functionality. It displays genomic data with base counts for categories A, T, G, C in a multivec format. The x-axis represents genomic positions across multiple chromosomes, while the y-axis shows expression counts using colored bars. As users zoom in, white text marks of base pairs appear, adhering to a semantic zoom approach. The bars are color-coded for each category: blue for A, orange for T, green for G, and red for C. The visualization includes an interactive chart with bold text for improved readability.
