The visualization consists of two tracks, arranged vertically in a linear layout, displaying multivec files over the chromosome 1 interval of hg38 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track combines a bar chart and a scatter plot, with genomic positions on the x-axis. The y-axis represents expression values shown as bars and points, with point sizes indicating peak values. Data is stratified by rows for four samples, each differentiated by color: orange for 'sample 1', green for 'sample 2', blue for 'sample 3', and pink for 'sample 4'. The bottom track shows a bar chart visualizing expression with color-coded bars corresponding to the same sample categories. This representation emphasizes variances in expression across genomic regions, providing comparative insight into the data through distinct visual elements.
