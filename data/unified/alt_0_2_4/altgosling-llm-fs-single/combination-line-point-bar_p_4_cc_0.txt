A multi-track visualization in a linear layout showcases data from a multivec file along chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. The first track displays a combination of line and scatter plot, representing the genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis. Points vary in size based on the peak value. The visualization is stratified by rows for four samples, each distinguished by unique colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The second track features a scatter plot where points are also sized by peak values with varying opacities, maintaining the sample-based color differentiation. The third track illustrates a bar chart, showing min and max peak values with bars. The categories are represented through color-coded bars corresponding to each sample. The visualization integrates interactive tooltips that provide genomic position, peak values, and sample information.
