A circular and linear genome visualization, linked by an interactive blue brush. The circular view covers the whole genome, highlighting chromosomes in text, with tracks like an ideogram, a "Putative Driver" text track, and the "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" tracks represented in blue and orange rectangles respectively. A line-connection track visualizes structural variations such as "Translocation" and "Duplication," with connections colored by category. The linear view, focused on chromosome 1, includes additional tracks like a gene annotation, "Point Mutation" scatterplot, and "Copy Number Variants" bar chart. The positions and categories are consistent with the circular view, enhancing genomic insights. The design uses hg19 assembly and facilitates in-depth genomic exploration through diverse data types, visualizations, and interactivity.
