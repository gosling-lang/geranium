A visualization titled "Visual Linking" presents an interactive setup to explore genomic data. The arrangement is vertical, comprising three main views. At the top left is a linear chart with genomic intervals on the x-axis, represented by areas colored according to categories 'sample 1' through 'sample 4.' This chart includes a gray brush to select specific regions.

Adjacent to it is a circular line chart, displaying the same categories in curved lines over the chromosome 1 domain, also equipped with a brush for selection. Below these, a detailed horizontal linear scatter plot shows genomic positions along the x-axis and quantitative values on the y-axis, stratified by categories, using distinct point colors for each sample. The scatter plot updates dynamically based on the brush positions from the upper charts, providing a closer view of specific genomic intervals on chromosome 1 between 160,000,000 and 200,000,000 bases.
