**Description:**

This visualization is a multi-category scatter plot in a linear layout that represents genomic data for chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500 using a multivec file. Each of the four categories, labeled 'sample 1' through 'sample 4,' is represented by rows of points. The x-axis depicts genomic positions, while the y-axis and the size of the points encode quantitative 'peak' values. Each category is color-coded for clarity and identification: 'sample 1' in yellow, 'sample 2' in green, 'sample 3' in blue, and 'sample 4' in pink. The points are semi-transparent with an opacity value of 0.5. Tooltips provide detailed information such as genomic position, value, and sample when hovering over points. This scatter plot is designed for interactive exploration of genomic intervals and quantitative data.
