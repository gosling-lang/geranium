A linear visualization of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is presented with a detailed multi-track view. The data is sourced from the WashU Virus Genome Browser, NCBI, and GISAID. Five distinct tracks are aligned vertically, each revealing specific genomic features of the NC_045512.2 reference assembly, spanning positions 1 to 29,903.

The first track, titled "NC_045512.2 Genes," illustrates genomic intervals with green rectangles, each accompanied by a pink triangle pattern indicating the reading frame direction. Gene names are labeled in pink text, clearly legible due to text bounding.

The second track is "S Protein Annotation," stratified by key protein domains and motifs, including the receptor-binding domain, receptor-binding motif, S1/S2 cleavage site, and heptad repeats. Each is color-coded accordingly, and black text labels are positioned adjacent to relevant regions.

Following is the "NC_045512.2 Sequence" track, showcasing base counts in a bar graph format where the y-axis represents count values. Bases 'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C' are encoded with different colors, facilitating identification. White text overlays display the base where space allows.

The fourth track depicts "TRS-L-Dependent Recombination Events," visualizing connections between recombination sites as soft blue arcs, highlighting connections across genomic positions. These arcs are subtly colored to maintain clarity without overshadowing colored details.

Together, the tracks offer a comprehensive genomic
