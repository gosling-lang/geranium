A circular and a linear arrangement visualize genomic data for hg19. The circular view includes an ideogram with a blue interactive brush, linking to the linear view that focuses on chromosome 1. The circular track comprises five layers: an ideogram, a text annotation track titled "Putative Driver," two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" with blue and orange rectangles, respectively, and a link track showing genomic connections colored by categories like "Translocation," "Duplication," and "Deletion." The linear view presents additional detail: a gene annotation track, a scatterplot titled "Point Mutation" showing mutation data with points colored by "SUBTYPE," and a "Copy Number Variants" track depicting quantitative data as gray rectangles. Each track is connected, allowing integrated exploration across different genomic features.
