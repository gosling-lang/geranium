A complex visualization comprising a circular and a linear view. The circular view depicts the entire human genome, highlighting various features such as an ideogram and genomic annotations. Key tracks include a point annotation track showing "Putative Driver" text annotations, and two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," visualized with colored rectangles. Connections between genomic positions are illustrated with lines differing in color according to structural variations like 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.'

The linear view, linked to the circular one via an interactive blue brush, focuses on chromosome 1. It encompasses similar tracks, with additional layers like a scatterplot titled "Point Mutation," which portrays mutations using a VCF file, with each point's position reflecting the distance to the previous mutation. The plot also includes a gene annotation track, another VCF-visualized range track showing 'Insertion' and 'Deletion,' and a CSV-visualized track for Copy Number Variants. Color coding in both views highlights categorical data from fields like 'svclass' and 'SUBTYPE'.
