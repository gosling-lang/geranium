A linear layout visualization depicts segmental duplications on chromosome 1 between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. It features multiple tracks, each showing green rectangles representing genomic intervals, connected by semi-transparent links of the same color. These links highlight the duplications between different genomic segments. The outlines and connecting lines are in a slightly darker green (#4C6629) with an opacity of 0.15, adding depth and visibility to the parallel connections across the chromosome. The data is sourced from a CSV file specifying the genomic fields, ensuring detailed genomic annotation in a genomic browser view.
