This complex visualization features both circular and linear views to represent genomic data. The circular view displays an ideogram of the entire genome, highlighting tracks for "Gain" in blue and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in orange, using rectangles to show genomic ranges. It includes a line-connection track with connections of various colors representing categories such as "Translocation", "Duplication", "Deletion", "Inversion (TtT)", and "Inversion (HtH)" based on the data field 'svclass'. The linear view, corresponding to chromosome 1, includes multiple tracks: an ideogram, a text annotation track labeled "Putative Driver", a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" showing mutation points, and tracks for copy number variants and indels ('Insertion' and 'Deletion') depicted with colored rectangles. Rectangles and line connections' colors indicate different genetic mutations or variations. An interactive brush in the circular view links the linear view to specific regions, enhancing data exploration.
