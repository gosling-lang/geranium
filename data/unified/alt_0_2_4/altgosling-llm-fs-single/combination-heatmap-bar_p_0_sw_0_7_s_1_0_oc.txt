A vertically arranged visualization features two charts in a linear layout, showing genomic data across chromosome 1, from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top chart is a heatmap, where genomic intervals are presented on the x-axis. The intensity of colors encodes expression values, stratified by rows representing four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The bottom chart is a multi-row bar chart with bars on the y-axis representing expression values for each sample. Each sample is color-coded distinctly, corresponding to the sample categories. Both tracks utilize a multivec data source for genomic peak values.
