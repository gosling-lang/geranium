The visualization is a linear layout displaying genomic annotations across chromosome 3, from positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. It consists of six individual tracks, each labeled with titles such as 'GmGDV', 'Corces et al.', 'Cyverse-QUBES', and 'HiGlass'. The tracks use different visual encodings to represent genomic features like genes and exons, with visuals including text labels, rectangles, and direction indicators. Colors indicate strand orientation, with features on the positive strand colored blue and those on the negative strand in red. The visualization is styled to highlight text annotations, directional triangles, and exon rectangles, with specific color assignments for various genomic structures.
