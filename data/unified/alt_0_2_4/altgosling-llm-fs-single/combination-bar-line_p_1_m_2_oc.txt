The visualization comprises two tracks laid out in a vertical arrangement, depicting multivec data across chromosome 1 from base 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a bar chart organized into four distinct rows, each representing 'sample 1' to 'sample 4.' The genomic positions are plotted on the x-axis, while peak expressions are displayed on the y-axis and encoded within the bar sizes. The color-coding of the bars corresponds to the different samples, enhancing categorical distinction. The bottom track features a line chart where genomic positions align with the x-axis, displaying peak data on the y-axis through connecting lines, again color-coded to distinguish between samples. The charts incorporate tooltip interactivity to reveal details about positions, peak values, and sample names. The data is rendered in a linear layout within a horizontal orientation using the hg38 assembly. The dynamic interaction with zoom capabilities and the provision of genomic tooltips facilitate a detailed exploration of the dataset.
