The visualization is a linear layout displaying genomic data for chromosome 1 using the hg38 assembly. The top track is an ideogram showing cytoband patterns with different colors representing categories like "gneg," "gpos," and "acen." Below is a gene annotation track, with blue and orange triangles indicating gene direction based on strand orientation. Two tracks display copy number variations (CNVs) using pink and purple rectangles for tumor-specific genomic ranges. The bottom track illustrates structural variations with lines connecting genomic positions. Different colors and strokes represent various structural variant classes, such as "tandem-duplication" and "translocation."
