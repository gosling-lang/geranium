The visualization consists of two horizontally arranged linear genomic tracks, titled "HiGlass" and "Cyverse-QUBES," overlaying the same genomic region from chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. Each track displays gene annotations using arrows to represent gene direction and rectangles for exon regions. The "HiGlass" track uses color coding for strand orientation, with strands "+" in blue and "-" in red. Arrows indicate gene direction, with triangle markers denoting start and end points. The "Cyverse-QUBES" track visualizes genes and exons in purple with gray arrows, and additional styling for exons includes purple strokes. Both tracks are vertically arranged by strand and display gene names along the genomic regions.
