A dual scatter plot visualizes multivec data in a linear, vertical arrangement, covering chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500. Both tracks use points to represent genomic position on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. The top track stratifies points into rows by 'sample,' while the bottom track overlays them. Points vary in size based on 'peak' value and are colored to distinguish categories, including 'sample 1' (blue), 'sample 2' (orange), 'sample 3' (green), and 'sample 4' (red). Opacity of 0.5 enhances visualization. Tooltips provide detailed genomic and categorical information.
