A visualization with a linear layout displays genomic data of chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a heat map, where the intensity of color represents 'peak' values for samples 1 to 4, depicted in a sequential color range from light to dark. The bottom track consists of a bar chart with bars for each sample, representing the 'peak' values. Rows are categorized by sample, each highlighted in distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. Information regarding genomic positions and peak values is accessible via tooltip interactions.
