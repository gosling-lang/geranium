A circular line chart in a circular layout visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. It displays expression values across four different samples, visualized with distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. Each line represents data points for different samples arranged in rows. The x-axis represents genomic intervals, and the y-axis shows expression values ranging from 0 to 0.01.
