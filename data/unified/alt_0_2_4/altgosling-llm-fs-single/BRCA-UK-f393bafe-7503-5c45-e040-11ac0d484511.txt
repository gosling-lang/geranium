A visualization combining a circular and a linear view. The circular view provides a complete overview of the genome with an ideogram, annotation tracks, and line connections, depicting data fields such as 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' using color-coded rectangles. The linear view zooms into chromosome 1 and includes tracks for gene annotations, point mutations, and copy number variants. The scatter plot, titled 'Point Mutation,' shows the distance to previous mutations with color differentiation based on mutation subtype. Line connections indicate structural variants across the chromosome, with categories like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.' Both views are interactively linked via a blue brush in the circular ideogram.
