A genomic visualization captures transcript data on chromosomes 3, 2, and 17, using mark displacement to resolve visual overlaps. The top view, titled "hg38 | Transcript (Max. 15 Rows)," displays rows of blue and orange arrows representing transcripts on chromosome 3, differentiated by strand direction and spread to avoid overlap. The central view, "Likely Benign," visualizes genetic variants on chromosome 2 with green points and colored text based on nucleotide variants; parallel connections indicate relationships between gene loci. The bottom view shows chromosome 17's pathogenic significance using a stacked point chart; points are color-coded to represent variant classifications such as "Pathogenic" or "Benign." The layout utilizes linear tracks, varying mark types, and stratified rows to depict complex genomic data across specified chromosome intervals.
