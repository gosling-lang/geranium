A circular and linear visualization displays genomic data for hg19 assembly. The circular view includes an ideogram and tracks for categories such as 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)', using blue and orange rectangles. A connection track shows links of structural variations colored by type: 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', 'Inversion (TtT)', and 'Inversion (HtH)'. An interactive brush links this with the linear view, focusing on chromosome 1. 

The linear view includes an ideogram with colored bands and tracks for gene annotations, point mutations, and structural variations. The point mutation track titled 'Point Mutation' displays variations as points in different colors for 'C>A', 'C>G', 'C>T', etc. The track for 'Copy Number Variants' uses gray rectangles. Rectangles for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' are displayed below point mutations. Tooltips provide additional details on genomic positions, mutation types, and other attributes. The overall layout uses interactive features for exploring genomic intervals and detailed annotations.
