A pair of line charts in a linear layout display genomic data from a multivec file for chromosome 1 of hg38. The top track uses a green line to represent expression values across positions, featuring an interactive steel blue brush that links to the bottom track. The bottom track, titled "Example: Brushing and Linking," highlights expressions in pink lines within the brushed region, with a lighter steel blue background. The visualization emphasizes the dynamic interaction between the two views through brushing and linking.
