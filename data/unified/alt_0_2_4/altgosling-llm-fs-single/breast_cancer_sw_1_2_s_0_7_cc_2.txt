A linear genomic visualization displaying data for chromosome 1, with five distinct tracks. The first track is an ideogram that shows the chromosomeâ€™s bands in various colors, including blue, orange, green, red, and purple, indicating different staining properties. The second track is a gene annotation track, featuring right and left triangles to represent genes on different strands, color-coded in blue and orange. The third and fourth tracks are rectangular charts visualizing copy number variation data, with green rectangles indicating regions with alterations. The final track, a linkage diagram, displays connections between genomic regions using curved lines categorized by structural variations like tandem duplications and translocations, each represented by distinct colors and strokes.
