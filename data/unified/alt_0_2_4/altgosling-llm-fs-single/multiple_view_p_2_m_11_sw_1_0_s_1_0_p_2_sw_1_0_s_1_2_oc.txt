The visualization titled "Visual Linking" consists of a circular line chart and a linear area chart, followed by a scatter plot. These are organized vertically, focused on chromosome 1. The circular chart, showing the whole chromosome, uses lines colored according to different categories ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'). An interactive brush can be moved to update the views. The linear chart displays genomic intervals in an area format with corresponding category colors. The scatter plot at the bottom provides a detailed view of a specific region on chr1 (160,000,000-200,000,000), plotting 'peak' values against genomic positions, colored by category. The design allows users to explore genomic data interactively.
