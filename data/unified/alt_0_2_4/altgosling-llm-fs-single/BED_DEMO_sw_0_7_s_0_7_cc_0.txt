A linear genomic visualization showcases BED files over chromosome 1, from positions 1 to 2,000,000. It includes four distinct tracks:

1. **BED12**: Displays all 12 standard BED fields with green rectangles, covering genomic intervals.
2. **BED6**: Shows the first 6 BED fields, also in green, marking similar genomic regions.
3. **BED6+6**: Combines the first 6 BED fields with 6 custom fields, using blue rectangles to highlight specified positions.
4. **BED12+1**: Features all 12 standard fields and one additional custom field, with regions denoted in green. 

Each track's data is linked to specific genomic start and end fields, visualized as rectangular marks along the x-axis.
