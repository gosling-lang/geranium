The visualization titled "Visual Linking" features an interactive genomic data representation using a multivec file. The arrangement is vertical, emphasizing the concept of data linkage controlled by brushes.

The upper section showcases a linear scatter plot of chromosome 1, focusing on the interval between 160,000,000 and 200,000,000. The y-axis represents expression values with points, stratified by categories such as 'sample 1' to 'sample 4', colored in blue, orange, green, and red respectively.

Below, the layout splits into two components: a horizontal chart with displayed areas and a circular line chart. The horizontal area chart displays genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression levels on the y-axis across samples. It features a brush tool that links and updates detail views between these representations.

On the right, a static circular line chart displays the same genomic data, with lines colored by sample categories. The chart's x-axis is linked to the linear views through a brush, enabling dynamic range selection and enhanced detail view control.

The subtitle "Change the position and range of brushes to update the detail view on the bottom" highlights the visualization's interactive nature, allowing users to explore genomic data efficiently.
