The visualization is a circular parallel layout consisting of five concentric rings, each representing a different chromosome from chr1 to chr5. Each ring displays genomic data using an area mark to show quantitative values of peaks, colored according to four distinct categories labeled as 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'. Additionally, the rings include an ideogram track with text labels for cytogenetic bands, and rectangles and triangles indicating different band densities and specific stains. Rectangles are color-coded based on density, ranging from white to black, while gvar regions are highlighted in purple. Acen regions are marked with red triangles on either end. The overall static circular design provides a compact representation of multiple datasets in a single view.
