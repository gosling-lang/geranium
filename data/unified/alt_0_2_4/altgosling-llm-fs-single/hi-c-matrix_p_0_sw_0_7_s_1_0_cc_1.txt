A visualization titled "Hi-C Matrix: Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations" displays genomic data in a linear layout covering an interval from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 base pairs. This visualization overlays multiple tracks:

1. **Heatmap Matrix**: Positioned on both x- and y-axes, it represents genomic intervals with color intensities indicating expression values using a "hot" color range, with a light gray background. The assembly used is hg38.

2. **Vertical and Horizontal Lines**: The chart includes vertical lines colored sky blue and horizontal lines in purple, marking specified genomic positions (e.g., at 100,000 on chr2, chr5, chr10) with a stroke width of 2.

3. **Bar Annotations**: Alongside the matrix, bars exhibit categories with strokes varied by chromosome (chr6, chr7, chr8), indicating their quantitative values with opacity set at 0.5.

4. **Point Chart**: Points plotted over the matrix have sizes representing quantitative values and are colored green with an opacity of 0.5. These use genomic coordinates and extend along specified intervals.

Overall, the visualization is dynamic, featuring a dashed line styling and supporting interaction by linking specific genomic intervals within the hg38 human genome assembly.
