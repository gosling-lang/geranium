The visualization presents an ideogram of the human genome (assembly hg38) along with text and triangle marks. This chart, titled "Example: Semantic Zooming," uses a linear layout to display chromosome positions on the x-axis. As you zoom in, additional details such as text labels and triangle markers for specific genomic features become visible. Rectangles represent chromosome bands with colors indicating different categories; categories not classified as "acen" are shown in varying shades of gray and black, while triangles appear in maroon for "acen" regions. This semantic zooming functionality allows for detailed exploration of chromosomal data as more information becomes apparent with closer examination.
