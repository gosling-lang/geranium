The visualization is a multi-track genomic data display in a linear layout, focusing on chromosome 1 from base 1 to 3,000,500. It contains four distinct charts layered vertically. 

1. The first chart is a combination of a line chart and scatter plot, highlighting peak values for four samples across genomic positions. Lines and points are color-coded by sample, with point size indicating peak magnitude.

2. The second chart is a scatter plot showing the distribution of peak values for the same samples, with points sized by peak value and semi-transparent for visual clarity.

3. The third chart is a bar chart that presents peak ranges as bars, stratified by sample category. The chart uses top and bottom axes for genomic intervals.

4. The fourth chart is a heat map, encoding peak values with color intensity across genomic intervals. Rows represent different samples, with color gradients indicating varying expression levels.

Consistent color coding across charts aids in comparing datasets, and each row represents data from different samples, enhancing the detailed multiperspective genomic analysis.
