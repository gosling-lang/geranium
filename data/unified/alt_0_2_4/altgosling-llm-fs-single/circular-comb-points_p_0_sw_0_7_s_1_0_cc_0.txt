A pair of circular scatter plots visualizes genomic data for chromosome 1 ranging from 1 to 3,000,500. The plots display points representing samples 1 to 4, stratified by color with a semi-transparent effect. The left chart shows rows for different categories with varied colors for each sample. The right chart adds a grid, maintaining the same color scheme. Both plots use size encoding for the field 'peak.' The x-axis represents genomic position, while the y-axis conveys quantitative values. Each plot is interactive, providing tooltips with detailed data insights.
