A linear layout visualization uses BAM data to depict genomic coverage and variations on chromosome 1, spanning positions 136,750 to 139,450. The top track is a bar chart titled "example_higlass.bam", showing coverage with bars in silver. The bottom track, also titled "example_higlass.bam", uses rectangles to illustrate structural variations, stratified into categories such as 'normal read', 'deletion (+-)', and 'inversion (--)'. Each category is color-coded for clarity. The chart's interactive elements allow detailed exploration of genomic features, with a legend highlighting insert sizes of 300bp.
