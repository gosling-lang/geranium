A comparative visualization demonstrates two approaches to zooming within genomic data. The top chart, "New Approach: Stretching Tiles," contrasts with the "Original Approach" beneath it. Both charts use a linear layout to display genomic sequences within the domain interval of 350 to 396. The display leverages a CSV file comprising genomic positions and base categories. Each chart employs rows categorized by nominal names and showcases colored rectangles, where each color represents a different base. Text annotations are in black, enhancing readability. The visualization suggests improvements in rendering efficiency by scaling existing elements instead of redrawing them. The title, "Smoother Zoom," encapsulates the aim of enhancing user interaction with genomic data through visual optimization.
