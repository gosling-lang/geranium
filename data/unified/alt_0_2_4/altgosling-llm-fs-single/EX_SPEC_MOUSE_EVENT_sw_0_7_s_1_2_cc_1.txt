A linear layout with vertical arrangement showcases five distinct visualization tracks, each illustrating different genomic aspects. The first three tracks are bar charts representing grouped peak values across chromosome 1. The "Individual Marks" chart organizes these values by position, while "Group Marks By Sample" aggregates by sample categories, and "Group Marks By Genomic Position" uses genomic coordinates. The fourth track, "Group Marks By Gene," is a range annotation featuring gene layout and expression data on chromosome 3, employing gray triangle and rectangle marks to denote gene start, end, and exons. The final "Group Marks By Chromosome" track acts as an ideogram with colored rectangles and triangle markers, delineating cytogenetic bands for an overarching genomic context. Enhanced interaction includes mouse events like hover highlighting and range selection customization. The visualization is integrated with multi-sample and detailed annotation data, aiding in comprehensive genomic analysis.
