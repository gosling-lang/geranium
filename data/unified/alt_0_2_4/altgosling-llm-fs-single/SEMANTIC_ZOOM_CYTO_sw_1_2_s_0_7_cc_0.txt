A linear ideogram chart presents an overview of human chromosomes using the HG38 assembly. Each chromosome is represented by rectangles with varying shades of gray, indicating different categories. Text labels and triangle markers appear as part of a semantic zooming interaction to provide finer details. The title is "Example: Semantic Zooming," with a subtitle emphasizing detail visibility upon zoom. The chart spans a width of 672 pixels and a height of 47.5 pixels. Rectangles for chromosomes are outlined in gray with a stroke width of 0.5, and different stains present distinct colors including black, white, and shades of gray based on their classification.
