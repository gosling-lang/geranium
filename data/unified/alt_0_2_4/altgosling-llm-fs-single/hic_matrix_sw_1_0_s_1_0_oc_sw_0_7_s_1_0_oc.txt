The visualization is a heat map displayed in a linear layout, representing a matrix file from the human genome (hg38) assembly. The x- and y-axes show genomic intervals ranging from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 base pairs, with chromosomes labeled along both axes. Genomic regions are represented by rectangles, and the color intensity encodes quantitative values, with a grayscale color scheme. This visualization provides a comparative view of genomic interactions, useful for identifying patterns such as similarities and differences in genomic sequences across different chromosomal regions.
