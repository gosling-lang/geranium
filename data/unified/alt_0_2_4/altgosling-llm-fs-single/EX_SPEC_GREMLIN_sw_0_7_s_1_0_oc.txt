The visualization consists of multiple views in a linear layout, displaying chromosome 5. The top track includes an ideogram of chromosome 5 with distinct bands colored in shades of gray and pink to represent different staining regions. Text annotations display the names of the bands. A brush is present on the x-axis for interactive exploration of the data. Below the ideogram, there are tracks with colored rectangles indicating different chromosomal regions. The rectangles are colored based on their categories: blue, gold, and green, corresponding to other chromosomes (hs5, hs4, hs6) and displayed with reduced opacity. Connections between these regions are shown using arcs, with strokes colored similarly to the rectangles. The middle view titled "Region of Interest" highlights a specific segment of chromosome 5, emphasizing connections with blue and green strokes. Another segment, titled "Rearrangement View," focuses on a smaller region within the same chromosome, displaying a large blue arc indicating a rearrangement. The entire visualization spans chromosome 5, emphasizing genetic structures and variations. The title is "Gremlin (O'Brien et al. 2010)," and the visualization is styled with elliptical links and light gray outlines.
