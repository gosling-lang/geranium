A circular visualization titled "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements" features four stacked tracks. The outermost track is a purple bar chart representing genomic expression levels. Inside, two circular ideograms display genomic intervals, with colors indicating different categories related to genomic stain. The innermost track consists of connection links between genomic positions, with links displayed in light gray and black to differentiate categories. Data is derived from multivec, CSV, and Circos formats. The design is static with a center radius, organized in a parallel arrangement.
