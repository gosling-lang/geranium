The visualization titled "SARS-CoV-2" with the subtitle "Data Source: WashU Virus Genome Browser, NCBI, GISAID" presents a linear layout showcasing the genomic features of the NC_045512.2 assembly, encompassing a length of 29,903 bases. The top chart illustrates the genes of NC_045512.2, represented by sky blue rectangles, pink vertical lines, and sky blue text. It includes an interactive brush on the x-axis linked to the other charts. Below, the "S Protein Annotation" chart is stratified into rows for different protein domains, such as receptor-binding domain (RBD) and S1/S2 cleavage site, each assigned distinct colors. Following is another NC_045512.2 gene track, this time displaying navy blue rectangles, white vertical lines, and black text. The "Sequence" track features a bar chart indicating genomic positions, with colors representing nucleotide categories (A, T, G, C), accompanied by text annotations. The "TRS-L-Dependent Recombination Events" track visualizes connections between genomic intervals, with arcs shaded in green.
