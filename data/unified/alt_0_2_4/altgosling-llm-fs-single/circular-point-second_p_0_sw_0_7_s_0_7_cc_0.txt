A circular scatter plot visualizes multivec data across chromosome 1 (positions 1 to 3,000,500) in a vertical arrangement. The plot consists of points that represent genomic positions ('position') on the circular x-axis, with expression values ('peak') displayed on the y-axis. Points vary in size and are colored distinctively based on categories ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4') in shades of blue, orange, green, and red. The plot features a semi-transparent opacity level set at 0.5 and includes interactive tooltips that offer detailed information for each genomic position, such as start and end positions, peak values, and sample names. The visualization is static and uses the hg38 genome assembly, with visual enhancement through grid lines and a legend for categories.
