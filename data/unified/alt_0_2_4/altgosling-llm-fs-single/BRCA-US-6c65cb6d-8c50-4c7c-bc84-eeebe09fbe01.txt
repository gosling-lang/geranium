The visualization consists of a circular and linear layout, displaying genomic data from the hg19 assembly. The circular view contains multiple tracks: an ideogram, a text annotation track labeled "Putative Driver," and tracks illustrating genomic ranges for "Gain" in sky blue and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in orange. Connections between genome positions are shown with lines of varying colors, indicating structural variations such as Translocation, Duplication, Deletion, and various Inversions.

The circular and linear views are linked via an interactive blue brush. The linear view, focused on chromosome 1, includes an ideogram, another "Putative Driver" text track, and additional tracks such as gene annotations and a scatter plot for "Point Mutation." The scatter plot visualizes point mutations from a VCF file, with points colored by subtype. Rectangular tracks titled "Copy Number Variants," "Insertion," and "Deletion" represent genomic variations, with quantitative values encoded by bar lengths. The arrangement effectively highlights structural and copy number variations across different genomic regions.
