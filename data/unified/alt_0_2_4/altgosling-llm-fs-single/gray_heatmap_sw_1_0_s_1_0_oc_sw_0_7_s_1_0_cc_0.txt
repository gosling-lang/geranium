A static linear heat map visualizes a genomic matrix file (hg38 assembly). The x- and y-axes represent genomic positions across the whole genome, with a focus on hg38. The matrix is displayed using rectangular marks, where the intensity of the color follows a "hot" color scheme, reflecting values within the data. The layout is horizontal, and the visualization spans a width of 310 and a height of 430 pixels.
