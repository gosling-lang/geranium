The visualization consists of two charts in a linear layout. The first track displays a multi-row area chart, showing genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. Each row represents one of four samples, and the area indicates expression values. The samples are distinctively colored (orange, green, blue, and purple) to differentiate them. The second track is a scatter plot featuring the same dataset. Points plot expression values in the y-axis corresponding to genomic positions on the x-axis. Each sample is color-coded consistently with the area chart, allowing for comparison across the two views. The visualization effectively displays variations in expression values across genomic positions and samples.
