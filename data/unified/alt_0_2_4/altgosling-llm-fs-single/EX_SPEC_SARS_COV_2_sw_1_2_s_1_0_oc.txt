A genomic visualization in a linear layout showcases SARS-CoV-2 data sourced from the WashU Virus Genome Browser, NCBI, and GISAID. The entire genome NC_045512.2 is displayed in five tracks. The first track, "NC_045512.2 Genes," uses navy blue rectangles to represent genomic regions. An interactive white brush links to other tracks. The second track, "S Protein Annotation," layers information based on categories like receptor-binding domains. It uses distinct colors for each protein. The third track, "NC_045512.2 Sequence," is a bar chart with colors for nucleotide bases. The fourth track shows TRS-L-dependent recombination events through blue curved connections between genomic positions.
