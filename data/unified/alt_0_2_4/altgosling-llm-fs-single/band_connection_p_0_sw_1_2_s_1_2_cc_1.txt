The visualization is a linear layout depicting genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. It consists of seven individual tracks with three types of elements: rectangles and connections (betweenLinks). Rectangles represent genomic intervals, colored in purple, sky blue, and purple again, indicating different data segments. Connections (betweenLinks) visualize relationships between these intervals, with strokes in green and purple colors, showing interconnections across genomic locations. The opacity of all elements is set to 0.15, with stroke widths of 0.8. Identified as track elements, tooltip annotations provide start and end genomic positions, enhancing interaction with the data.
