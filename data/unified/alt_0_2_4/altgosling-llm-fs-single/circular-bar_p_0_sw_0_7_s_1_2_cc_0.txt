The circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file, representing genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The data consists of two samples, 'sample 1' and 'sample 2', each represented by a different color. The bars are stratified by rows corresponding to the samples and indicate the minimum and maximum peak values along the radial axes. The color legend highlights the samples in distinct colorsâ€”blue for 'sample 1' and orange for 'sample 2'. This chart, arranged in a circular layout with a vertical arrangement, provides an interactive visualization of genomic intervals using a center radius of 0.5 and outlined in black strokes for clarity.
