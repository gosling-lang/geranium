A circular heatmap visualizes genomic data between positions 1 and 3,000,500 on chromosome 1. The data is represented using a "multivec" file format across four samples labeled 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'. The heatmap is organized in a circular layout with a vertical arrangement and a central radius of 0.5. The intensity of the color in each segment indicates the "peak" value, with a color range mapped to a 'hot' color scheme. The x-axis displays genomic intervals at the top, while rows are stratified for each sample with corresponding legends. The visualization is static with an assigned circular dimension for both width and height. The title is 'Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts' with a subtitle 'Heatmap'.
