The visualization is a linear ideogram chart titled "Basic Marks: Rect," displaying genomic data from chromosome 1 of the human genome assembly hg38. The x-axis represents genomic intervals, starting at 1 and ending at 248,956,422. The chart uses rectangles to indicate different cytogenetic bands, with colors corresponding to six categories: gneg (white), gpos25 (light gray), gpos50 (medium gray), gpos75 (dark gray), gpos100 (black), and gvar (pale lavender). The data is sourced from a CSV file and filtered to exclude 'acen' regions. The chart emphasizes visual clarity with light gray outlines for each rectangle.
