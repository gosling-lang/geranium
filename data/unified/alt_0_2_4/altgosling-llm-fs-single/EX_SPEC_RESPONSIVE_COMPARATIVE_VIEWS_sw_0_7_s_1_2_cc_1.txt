The visualization consists of three horizontally arranged bar charts. Each chart represents genomic data extracted from the hg38 assembly. The data maps to specific chromosomes and intervals: chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000 for the first and third charts, and chromosome 9 for the second chart. 

Each track uses a multivec file with a bin size of 8, featuring the genomic field "peak." The y-axis encodes quantitative peak values, while the x-axis shows genomic positions. The color of the bars varies between sky blue for the first and last charts and purple for the middle chart. Bars have a white stroke of width 0.5 to outline their structures. The charts adjust to screen width, forming a vertical layout if the width is below 1200 pixels, ensuring responsive design.
