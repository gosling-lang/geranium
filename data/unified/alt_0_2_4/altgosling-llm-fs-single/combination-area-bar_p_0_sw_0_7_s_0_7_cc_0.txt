A linear layout visualization displays genomic data on chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top chart features an area plot with samples categorized into 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is displayed in a distinct color: blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The y-axis represents quantitative expression values, differentiating samples by row and color. The bottom chart is a bar plot, with bars representing minimum and maximum expression values for each sample over the same genomic interval. The tooltips provide genomic positions, expression values, and sample identifiers for further insight.
