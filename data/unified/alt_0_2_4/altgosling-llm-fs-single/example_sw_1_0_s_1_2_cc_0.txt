**Description:**

The visualization showcases various visual encoding methods in Gosling, arranged in a linear vertical layout. It covers chromosome 1, focusing on the interval between 1 and 3,000,500 base pairs.

1. **Heat Map:** Displays genomic intervals on the x-axis, with rows representing samples. Color intensity encodes expression values.

2. **Bar Charts:** Three different bar charts depict genomic data on the x-axis and expression on the y-axis. Categories are shown by bar colors, with one chart displaying grid lines for enhanced readability.

3. **Line and Scatter Plot:** Overlaid line plot and scatter plot, showing genomic data on the x-axis. Expression values are denoted by y-axis positions and point sizes, with color indicating categories.

4. **Scatter Plots:** Two scatter plots represent expression on y and size axes with genomic intervals on the x-axis. Categories are visualized using unique point colors.

5. **Area Chart:** Displays expression as shaded areas on the y-axis, stratified by categories, with the genome on the x-axis.

6. **Additional Bar Chart:** Shows genomic intervals on the x-axis with minimum and maximum expression limits on y and ye-axes. Color and rows separate the categories.

7. **Connections Chart:** Displays genomic intervals with connections, where colors represent different categories.

Each chart is interactive, providing tooltips with genomic positions and expression values for deeper data inspection. The title is "Visual Encoding," and the subtitle is "
