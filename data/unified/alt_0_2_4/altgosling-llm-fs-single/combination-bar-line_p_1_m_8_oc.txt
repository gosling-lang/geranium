A linear visualization displays genomic data for chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top track shows a combination of line and bar charts, stratified into four rows representing 'sample 1' to 'sample 4.' Each row is color-coded, showing genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. The lines and bars are different sizes, indicating expression levels. The bottom track features an area chart, overlaying the expression of the four samples. The colors in the area chart correspond to the samples, depicting quantitative variations over genomic positions. The visualization effectively uses category color coding and spatial arrangement to provide insights into genomic expression patterns.
