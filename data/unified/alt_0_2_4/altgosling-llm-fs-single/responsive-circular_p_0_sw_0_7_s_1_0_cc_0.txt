The circular bar chart visualizes genomic data from chromosome 12, within the interval of 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The chart is composed of several concentric circles, each corresponding to different samples. The data is represented using bars, with each bar's height proportional to the 'peak' value. The colors of the bars differentiate categories, and the visualization adapts responsively to the view's aspect ratio. The chart also includes interactive features like visibility changes based on the track's height, providing different opacity levels and domain ranges for quantitative Y values. The overall design references the graphical perception of multiple time series.
