A circular visualization is displayed with five parallel tracks, each representing a different chromosome, from chromosome 1 to chromosome 5. The layout is static and circular, with a center radius of 0.2. Each chromosome layer contains two main tracks. The first track displays genomic intervals as an area chart, where the x-axis represents genomic positions and the y-axis indicates quantitative values, such as peak expression levels. The colors correspond to different samples and include shades like blue, orange, green, and red. These tracks are visualized using a multivec data file.

The second track in each layer consists of circular ideograms, showing cytogenetic bands by visualizing CSV data. These ideograms include text labels for band names, colored rectangles for density categories, and annotations like purple right and left triangles, representing centromeric regions. Rectangles are colored to illustrate categories, with hues like white, gray, and black depending on density levels. The colors of the annotations and text include black for labels and maroon for triangle markers. Each layer represents different genomic regions for chromosomes 1 through 5, presented in a visually parallel format across the circular layout.
