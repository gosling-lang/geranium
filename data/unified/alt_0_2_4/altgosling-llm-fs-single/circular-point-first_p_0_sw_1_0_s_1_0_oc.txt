A circular scatter plot visualizes genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500 in a circular layout. The plot contains four stratified rows representing different samples, 'sample 1' to 'sample 4,' each differentiated by unique colors. Points in the scatter plot encode the peak values of the data, with both the y-axis and size reflecting quantitative values linked to 'peak.' The opacity of points is set to 0.5 for better visual distinction. The interactive tooltip provides additional genomic and quantitative details, including start and end positions, peak values, and sample identity.
