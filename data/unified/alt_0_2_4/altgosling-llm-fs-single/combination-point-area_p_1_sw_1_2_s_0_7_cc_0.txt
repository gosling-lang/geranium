A composite visualization consisting of two vertically arranged charts displays genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top chart is an area plot, stratified by samples. It features four rows representing 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4,' with distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The x-axis denotes genomic positions, while the y-axis shows quantitative peak values. The bottom chart is a scatter plot where points represent expression values, with size indicative of the peaks' magnitude. Each point is color-coded based on sample categories, maintaining consistency with the area chart. Both charts are overlaid with genomic intervals, including axes for precise data interpretation.
