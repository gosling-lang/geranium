The "Visual Linking" visualization showcases multivec data across three distinct charts in a vertical arrangement. At the top left, a circular line chart displays genomic intervals from chromosome 1 on the x-axis, with expression values on the y-axis. The data is categorized into rows by sample type, each represented by a unique color. This chart features an interactive brush that links to other charts for dynamic detail updates. In the top right, an area chart illustrates the same genomic data linearly, preserving the brush interaction for refined detail viewing. At the bottom, a scatter plot provides a detailed view of a specific chromosome 1 region, presenting expression values via colored points according to sample categories. This composition facilitates an interactive exploration of multivec data by dynamically linking overview and detailed representations through user-driven brush adjustments.
