The visualization titled "Hi-C Matrix" displays genomic data using overlaid matrix and annotations. The x-axis spans from chr5 to chr10, while the y-axis lists chr6 through chr10, focusing on an interval between 800,000,000 and 1,800,000,000. The main matrix shows interactions between genomic regions, with color intensity representing expression values in shades of grey. Overlaid vertical red and horizontal blue lines indicate genomic positions. Additional annotations include bars representing genomic intervals and points visualizing quantitative data in steel blue, with size proportional to their values. The layout aligns in a linear fashion, emphasizing the relationships between different chromosomal regions.
