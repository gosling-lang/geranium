The visualization consists of a circular and linear view, integrated for a genomic data analysis. The circular view displays the entire hg19 genome, highlighting specific tracks such as an ideogram, a point annotation track labeled "Putative Driver," and range annotation tracks for "Gain" (sky blue) and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" (dark orange). A connection track links genomic positions using different colors to represent categories like 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' and 'Deletion.' The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, providing a detailed ideogram, gene annotation track, scatterplot titled "Point Mutation" showcasing VCF file data, and a range annotation track titled "Copy Number Variants" showing quantitative data. The circular and linear views are linked through an interactive brush, enabling synchronized exploration across scales.
