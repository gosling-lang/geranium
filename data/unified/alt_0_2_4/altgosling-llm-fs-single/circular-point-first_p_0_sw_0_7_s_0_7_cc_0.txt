A circular scatter plot in a vertical arrangement displays a multivec file focusing on chromosome 1, from position 1 to 3,000,500. Each point represents a peak value, with the position on the circle indicating its genomic location. The plot is stratified by rows corresponding to four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each colored differently with blue, orange, green, and red. The size and y-position of the points depict quantitative peak values. The chart includes a legend and tooltips showing start and end positions, values, and sample identifiers. The opacity of the points is set to 0.5.
