The visualization is a scatter plot in a linear layout, representing genomic data from a multivec file related to the entire genome of hg38. The plot displays points colored in a light purple hue, each corresponding to genomic positions on the x-axis and peak expression values on both the y-axis and through their size. The title of the chart is "Basic Marks: point," and it is subtitled "Tutorial Examples." The data focuses on a single category labeled "sample 1," and uses a multivec data source available from a specified URL.
