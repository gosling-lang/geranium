A linear visualization in Gosling.js showcases various genomic data tracks. The top track is a gene annotation for chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000, using the gene annotation template. The track utilizes a BEDDB data file, with gene names represented in text and strand information indicated by color. The second track visualizes base-level sequence data for chromosome 1 from positions 77,925,299 to 77,925,320, displayed as a bar chart with text. Each base ('A', 'T', 'G', 'C') is color-coded. The third track is a whole-genome ideogram for chromosome 1, showing cytobands with a color scheme representing different stain types. The title is "Track Template In Gosling.js" with the subtitle emphasizing the ease of creating complex visualizations using track templates.
