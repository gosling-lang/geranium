The visualization is a linear layout chart titled "Rule Mark" with the subtitle "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines." It overlays multiple tracks. The first track is a bar chart displaying genomic data where positions are on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, with bars colored light gray. The second track adds rule marks with horizontal and vertical lines showing genomic data points from JSON values, displayed as red lines. Finally, blue vertical lines indicate genomic positions with fixed stroke width. The chart is styled with dashed lines and spans chromosomes to exhibit a range of data.
