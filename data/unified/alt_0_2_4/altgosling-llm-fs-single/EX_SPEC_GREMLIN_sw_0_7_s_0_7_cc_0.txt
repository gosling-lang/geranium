A visual overview of chromosome 5 showing genetic features and segmental duplications. The top chart depicts an ideogram of chromosome 5 spanning from 0 to 80,000,000 base pairs, highlighting various chromosomal bands with colors corresponding to stain types. A brush links to a detailed region of interest displayed below. The middle chart visualizes segmental duplications as green and blue arcs, categorized by interconnected chromosomes. The bottom chart, titled 'Rearrangement View,' focuses on a tight genomic segment, illustrating genomic rearrangements with a distinct purple arc. The title is 'Gremlin (O'Brien et al. 2010).'
