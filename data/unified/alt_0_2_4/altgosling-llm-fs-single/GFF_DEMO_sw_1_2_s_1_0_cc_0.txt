The visualization is a linear layout chart depicting a section of the E. coli genome between positions 222,000 and 240,000 on chromosome U00096.3. It uses a GFF3 file to display genomic features as arrows that indicate gene direction, colored by gene type such as protein-coding, tRNA, rRNA, ncRNA, pseudogene, and unknown categories. The chart is titled "GFF3 file," with the subtitle "E. coli genome, colored by gene type." Gene names are annotated above the arrows, with arrows on the top row indicating positive strand genes and those on the bottom row indicating negative strand genes. The visualization emphasizes gene biotypes using distinct colors like blue, orange, and green.
