A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec dataset, representing chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 of the hg38 genome assembly. The chart displays data as bars, with the height of each bar representing the 'peak' value, a quantitative field. The x-axis shows genomic positions, and the y-axis indicates expression levels on a grid. Bars are colored based on the 'sample' field, differentiating categories such as 'sample 1' (blue), 'sample 2' (orange), 'sample 3' (green), and 'sample 4' (red). A legend provides a guide to these categories. The layout is static and set in a circular configuration with a center radius of 0.5. Tooltip functionality displays genomic start and end positions, peak value, and sample category for each bar.
