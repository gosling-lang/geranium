The visualization is an area chart in a linear layout depicting genomic data from a multivec file. It spans the entire genome assembly hg38, showcasing the "position" on the x-axis and "peak" values on the y-axis, with the size of the mark set to 2. The chart is titled "Basic Marks: area" with a subtitle "Tutorial Examples." Data points are represented as continuous areas without specific category coloring, emphasizing the distribution and intensity of expression levels across the genome.
