A linear bar chart visualizes a multivec file, showing the genome of hg38. The position of the bars is encoded using the fields 'start/end' with genomic values, representing intervals on the x-axis. The height of the bars, representing 'peak' as quantitative data, is shown on the y-axis. The title is 'Basic Marks: bar' and the subtitle is 'Tutorial Examples.' Bars are set with a fixed size value of 5.
