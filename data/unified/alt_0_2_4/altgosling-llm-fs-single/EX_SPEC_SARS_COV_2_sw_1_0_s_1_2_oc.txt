A comprehensive linear visualization of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, sourced from the WashU Virus Genome Browser, NCBI, and GISAID, is presented over two main tracks. The first track highlights the NC_045512.2 genes, represented as navy blue rectangles with white outlines, accompanied by gene symbols in black text. The sequence is a complete view from position 1 to 29,903. The second track features a detailed S Protein annotation aligned with the genome, indicating specific domains such as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) in various colors. Additionally, a multivec heat map displays base counts ('A,' 'T,' 'G,' 'C') in corresponding colors, enriching the sequence layer. A set of TRS-L-Dependent Recombination Events is also visualized as light blue connection arcs, linking genomic regions. This visualization efficiently facilitates genomic exploration and annotation comprehension within the context of COVID-19 research.
