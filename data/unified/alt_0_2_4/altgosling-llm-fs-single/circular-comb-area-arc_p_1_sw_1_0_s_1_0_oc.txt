The visualization consists of two circular charts, both displaying genomic data from chromosome 1. The left chart features connections indicating genomic intervals, where color represents different categories. The right chart is an area plot with rows stratified by 'sample' categories, showing genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis. On the right, each row is colored differently, corresponding to the legend displaying samples 1 to 4. This layout provides an overview of genomic variations and peak distributions within specified intervals of the chromosome.
