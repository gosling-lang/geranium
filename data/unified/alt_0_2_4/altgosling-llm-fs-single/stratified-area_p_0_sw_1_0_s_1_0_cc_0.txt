The linear area chart visualizes genomic data from a multivec file for chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. The chart consists of four rows, labeled 'sample 1' through 'sample 4,' each represented by a distinct colorâ€”blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The x-axis represents genomic position, while the y-axis indicates the quantitative measure 'peak.' Each row stratifies the data by sample, displaying the area under the curve. Colors correspond to sample categories, and white strokes outline each area, enhancing visibility. Tooltips provide genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample names.
