A genomic visualization is presented in both circular and linear layouts, illustrating data on the hg19 assembly. The circular view includes tracks such as an ideogram, a text track titled "Putative Driver," two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and a connection track visualizing structural variations with categories like 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' and 'Inversion.' Interactive features link the circular and linear views, with a brush highlighting chromosome 1.

In the linear view, various tracks detail chromosome 1. An ideogram with arrows marks significant regions. A text track labeled "Putative Driver" displays genomic positions. Gene annotations appear as triangles and rectangles, showing strands and exons in grayscale. A scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" indicates mutation types using colorful dots. Additional tracks visualize insertions, deletions, and copy number variations, with bars representing total copy number. The visualization supports user interaction, highlighting regions and details through tooltips and clickable elements.
