A visualization comprises both a circular and linear view, highlighting genomic data from the hg19 assembly. The circular view, featuring an ideogram, displays the entire genome with a focus on chromosomes, using color-coded tracks for categories such as 'Gain,' 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' and various structural variations. Interactive elements like a blue brush connect this view to the linear representation below.

The linear view illustrates detailed genomic data for chromosome 1, including tracks for gene annotations, point mutations, and other structural variations. Key elements include a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' showing variant data with points colored by subtype, and range tracks visualizing insertion, deletion, and copy number variants. Each track is color-coded, facilitating the distinction of categories and structural variations. The interactive setup allows for smooth transitions and deep dives into specific genomic intervals.
