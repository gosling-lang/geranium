The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view, both displaying genomic data from the hg19 assembly. The circular view, positioned above, features a genomic ideogram with categories indicated by color, displaying a blue interactive brush for linking to the linear view. This view includes an ideogram track, a track titled 'Putative Driver' with genomic positions annotated in black text, a 'Gain' track with sky blue rectangles, and a 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' track with dark orange rectangles. A line-connection track displays genomic connections with colors representing categories like 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Duplication,' and 'Deletion.'

The linear view at the bottom focuses on chromosome 1. It replicates circular view tracks along with additional tracks such as a gene annotation track displaying genes and exons in grey, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' showing VCF data, and a track for copy number variants with light grey rectangles linked to quantitative values. Tracks are organized with rectangles and lines, and connections are illustrated with distinct colors and strokes. This comprehensive arrangement provides a detailed genomic overview, highlighting structural variations, gene mutations, and copy number alterations across the entire genome.
