A circular visualization displays genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The visualization consists of two circular views placed side by side. The left track features a circular line chart overlayed with a scatter plot, stratified by category with different colors for each sample ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'). The genome positions are on the x-axis, while peak values determine the y-axis and the size of scatter plot points. The right track presents a circular bar chart where genomic positions are shown on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis, with bar colors indicating different samples. This static visualization employs a multivec file and spans 350 by 130 units in dimension.
