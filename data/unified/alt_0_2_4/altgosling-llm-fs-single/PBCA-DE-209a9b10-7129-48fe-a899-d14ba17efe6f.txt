The visualization consists of two main views: a circular ideogram and a linear view, both displaying genomic data from the hg19 assembly. The circular ideogram provides an overview of genomic data across different chromosomes with interactive brushing that links to the linear view. It includes tracks such as a labeled ideogram, “Putative Driver” annotations, range annotations for "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in blue and orange, respectively, and connection lines representing structural variations. 

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, featuring an ideogram with centromere marks, driver annotations with black text labels, and a scatterplot titled "Point Mutation" illustrating point mutations with color-coded subtypes. Additional tracks include “Insertion” and “Deletion” annotations, each displaying within separate rows. Copy number variants are shown as gray bars indicating total copy number. The range annotation tracks highlight "Gain" in blue and "LOH" in orange, matching the circular view. Overall, the visualization employs color and shape to differentiate between genomic features and variations.
