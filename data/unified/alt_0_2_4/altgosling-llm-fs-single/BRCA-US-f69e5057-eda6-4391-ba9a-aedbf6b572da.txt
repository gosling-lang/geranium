A circular and linear genomic visualization displays the human genome assembly hg19. The circular layout presents the entire genome, with a focus on specific features using multiple tracks. An ideogram track shows chromosome bands with diverse shading for regions like 'gneg' and 'gpos'. A text-annotated track, named 'Putative Driver', highlights specific genes based on genomic positions, using black text. Rectangular tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' present regions of genomic variation in sky blue and dark orange, respectively. Link tracks illustrate structural variations, such as 'Translocation' and 'Duplication', using colored lines.

In the linear view focusing on chromosome 1, additional tracks offer detailed insights. Gene annotations are visualized with triangles and rectangles depicting strand directions and exon structures. A scatter plot, titled 'Point Mutation', represents mutation distances with color-coded points for different substitution types, like C>T and A>G. Tracks on insertions and deletions provide further insights into genomic variations, represented in green and brown. This detailed visualization serves as a comprehensive tool for genomic analysis.
