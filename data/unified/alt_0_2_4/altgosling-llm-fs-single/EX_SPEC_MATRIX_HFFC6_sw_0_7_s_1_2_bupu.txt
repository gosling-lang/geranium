The visualization titled "Matrix Visualization" compares Micro-C and Hi-C data for HFFc6 cells, focusing on chromosome 7 between positions 77,700,000 and 81,000,000. It is arranged horizontally and includes two main sections, each with vertical and horizontal tracks. The vertical tracks display bar charts representing genomic data for HFFc6_H3K4me3, HFFc6_ATAC, and HFFC6_CTCF. The colors of the bars vary, with dark green for HFFc6_H3K4me3, orange for HFFc6_ATAC, and navy blue for HFFC6_CTCF. Genomic position annotation tracks use pink and green triangles to represent strand information. The horizontal tracks consist of matrix representations titled "HFFc6_Micro-C" and "HFFc6_Hi-C," displaying genomic interactions via color intensity. Additionally, an Epilogos track categorized by various genomic features is included, showing data via a multicolor bar chart. The visualization uses hg38 assembly and applies specific styles like background color #F6F6F6 for clarity.
