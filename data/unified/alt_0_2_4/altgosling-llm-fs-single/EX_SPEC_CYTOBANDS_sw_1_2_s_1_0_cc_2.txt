The visualization consists of multiple area charts arranged in parallel, each representing a different chromosome from 1 to 5. The x-axis of each chart displays genomic positions, while the y-axis shows quantitative expression values. The area is colored to indicate different sample categories, with colors including blue, orange, green, and red, among others. Below each area chart, an ideogram presents cytogenetic band information along the same genomic axis. The bands are visually encoded using rectangles, text, and right and left triangles. Color variations within the rectangles signify different stain densities, ranging from white to black. Maroon triangles denote special regions, while blue and purple rectangles highlight distinct cytogenetic bands across the chromosomes. The visualization provides a comprehensive view of genomic data along with cytogenetic context.
