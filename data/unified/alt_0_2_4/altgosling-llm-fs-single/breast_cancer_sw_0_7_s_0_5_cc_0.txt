The visualization presents a linear layout of various genomic tracks for chromosome 1, using human genome assembly hg38. The ideogram track at the top displays cytobands in a spectrum of colors according to their stain type, with intervals denoted using rectangles and triangles. Below, a gene annotation track stratified by strand uses arrowheads to indicate directionality: rightward for the positive strand and leftward for the negative strand. Two subsequent tracks showcase copy number alterations in tumor data, with variations marked by blue and green rectangles representing specific genomic intervals. Lastly, a complex connections track displays structural rearrangements, visualized with curved lines connecting different genomic regions. These lines are colored and styled according to structural variant classes, providing insights into chromosomal alterations.
