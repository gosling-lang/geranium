A circular scatter plot visualizes genomic data across chromosome 12, covering positions from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. This plot utilizes a multivec file to depict expression values (peaks) on the radial axes, with rows categorizing different samples. There are multiple overlays to highlight various expression domains, such as 0 to 0.0025 and 0.0075 to 0.01, stratifying the data into distinct opacity levels for clarity. Each point on the plot is colored according to its category among samples â€” including samples 1 through 16, each depicted in unique colors like blue, orange, and purple. The plot is accompanied by detailed annotations from the TVCG 2010 study by Javed et al., focusing on graphical perception in multiple time series.
