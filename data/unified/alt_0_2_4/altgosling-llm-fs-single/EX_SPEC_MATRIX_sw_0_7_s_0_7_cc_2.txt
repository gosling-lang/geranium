The visualization is a Hi-C matrix in a linear layout, showcasing genomic interactions across various chromosomes. The matrix employs a color scheme to represent expression values, where intensity correlates with interaction frequency. The primary data range stretches from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 on the genomic axes. Overlaid tracks include vertical and horizontal lines with distinct colors for annotation, and bars with categorical strokes. Additionally, a scatter of points on the x and y genomic axes highlights specific features. The blue lines and points indicate annotations and values, respectively, with sizes reflecting quantitative variations. Additional styling features include light gray backgrounds and dashed grid lines, contributing to the overall readability and organization of the visualization. The title is "Hi-C Matrix" with the subtitle "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations," emphasizing the interactive exploration of genetic data.
