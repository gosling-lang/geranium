A multi-track genomic visualization consists of two main views for chromosomes 12 and 8, displaying detailed information on genomic intervals from positions 10,140,000 to 10,210,000 and 127,734,000 to 127,744,000, respectively. Both views include an annotation track with gene names represented as text, and icons indicating strand direction: right-facing and left-facing triangles, alongside dashed lines representing gene boundaries. There are three bar charts per chromosome, highlighting expression peaks from three samples. The bars' colors differentiate samples: green for the first two samples and blue or pink for the third, depending on the chromosome. The visualization enables comparative analysis across samples and annotated genomic features, facilitating insights into variations within the specified regions.
