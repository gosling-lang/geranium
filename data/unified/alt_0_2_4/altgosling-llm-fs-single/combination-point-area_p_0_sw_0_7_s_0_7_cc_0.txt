The visualization consists of two tracks arranged vertically. The top track features a scatter plot, mapping genomic positions of chromosome 1's range from 1 to 3,000,500 on the x-axis, with quantitative expression values displayed both on the y-axis and as varying point sizes. Points are semi-transparent, with colors representing different samples. The bottom track is an area chart stratified by samples, showing similar genomic position data on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Each sample is represented by a distinct color, with areas and stroke colors enhanced by thin white lines for separation. Tooltips provide detailed data insights, including start and end positions, peak values, and sample identification.
