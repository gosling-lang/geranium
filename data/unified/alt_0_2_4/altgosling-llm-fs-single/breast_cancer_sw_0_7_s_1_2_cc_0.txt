The visualization is a linear layout featuring five distinct tracks. The first track is an ideogram displaying chromosome 1, with colored rectangles and triangles indicating genomic regions and categories. The second track is a genomic annotation track showing gene orientations with blue right-facing triangles for forward strand genes and orange left-facing triangles for reverse strand genes. The third and fourth tracks are range annotation tracks using rectangular markers, colored sky blue for minor copy number variations and green for total copy number variations, respectively. The fifth track exhibits connections between genomic positions, represented by lines colored according to structural variant classes like tandem-duplication and inversion. The color and stroke of these connections further differentiate the structural variations, enhancing the genomic landscape comprehension.
