The visualization consists of two vertically arranged tracks depicting genomic data on chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500 in a linear layout. The top track is an overlay of line and bar charts, stratified by four sample categories ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'), with each category color-coded (blue, orange, green, red). This track represents the 'peak' values along the y-axis. The bars' heights are proportional to these expression values. The bottom track displays an area chart for the same genomic range, with areas filled according to the same categorical color scheme, visualizing the 'peak' values smoothed across the genome. The charts are synchronized in x domain to facilitate comparison, and both tracks use multivec data from a specified URL. Tooltips provide detailed information, including the genomic position and peak values for each sample.
