The visualization depicts a set of genomic data across chromosome 12 and chromosome 8. It features eight individual charts, organized into two groups based on chromosome and position intervals. 

For chromosome 12, the data spans from 10,140,000 to 10,210,000, and for chromosome 8, it covers from 127,734,000 to 127,744,000. Each group contains an annotation track with gene-specific text and a series of bar charts, showing data from three samples.

### Genomic Range Annotation Tracks:
- **Chromosome 12:** 
  - A genomic annotation track with pink color highlights gene exons and text labels, using right and left triangles, rectangles, and lines to indicate gene strands and regions.
  
- **Chromosome 8:** 
  - A similar genomic annotation track displayed in orange, representing gene information similarly with an emphasis on strand direction and exons.

### Bar Charts:
- **Expression Data:**
  - For both chromosomes, three samples (Sample 1, 2, and 3) are depicted using stacked bar charts. The expression levels shown on the y-axis vary, with pink bars for chromosome 12 and orange for chromosome 8.
  - Each sample chart uses consistent colors and intervals to convey quantitative peak data, illustrated with bars, emphasizing data differences and patterns across loci.

The orderly arrangement of tracks allows for a comprehensive view of genomic data and expression across different samples and regions, making the visualization
