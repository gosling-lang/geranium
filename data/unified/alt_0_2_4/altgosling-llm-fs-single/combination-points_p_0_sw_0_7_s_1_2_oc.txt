A vertical arrangement of two linear tracks visualizes a multivec file covering chromosome 1 from base 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a stratified scatter plot using the 'point' mark, displaying samples 1, 2, 3, and 4 in individual rows. Each sample category is identified by a unique color (yellow, green, blue, pink), with transparency set to 50%. The x-axis represents genomic positions, whereas the y-axis encodes 'peak' values. Tooltip data includes start and end genomic positions, peak value, and sample name. The bottom track is a similar scatter plot that overlays all samples in one view, highlighting comparative distribution across the same chromosomal interval. The plots are interactive, allowing data examination through tooltips. Both tracks are rendered in the hg38 assembly.
