The visualization titled "Breast Cancer Variant (Staaf et al. 2019)" showcases genetic characteristics of RAD51C- and PALB2-altered TNBCs using a combination of circular and linear layouts. The top section features a circular ideogram depicting the entire genome in chromosomal intervals, supplemented by overlay tracks for patient overview, putative driver genes, LOH, genetic gains, and structural variants, each distinguished by unique colors like black, orange, green, and multicolor connections representing SV classes like tandem duplications and translocations.

The bottom section consists of two linear views linked by interactive brushes. The first displays an ideogram of chromosome 1, driver gene annotations, and a detailed gene structure featuring exon and strand information. It includes LOH and Gain tracks highlighting affected genomic regions, and a structural variant track visualizing genomic connections with points indicating specific positions.

Two additional linear views present coverage and pileup tracks from a BAM file, focusing on chromosome 1 regions, displaying coverage as bar heights and individual reads as colored rectangles for different SV types. The integrated approach allows comprehensive exploration of genomic alterations associated with breast cancer variants, facilitating robust insights into structural and copy number variations.
