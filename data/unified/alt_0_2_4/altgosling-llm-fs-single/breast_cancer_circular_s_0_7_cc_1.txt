A circular representation of genomic data using the hg38 assembly shows four tracks. The outermost track is an ideogram that visualizes the genome's cyto-band patterns with different colors representing distinct categories. The second track shows genomic segments marked in purple, filtered to display regions with specific tumor characteristics (minor copy number equals zero). The third track highlights genomic regions in green, representing significant tumor copy number variations (total copy number within 4.5 to 900). The innermost track displays connections between genomic regions using curved lines, depicting structural variations. Different colors and strokes indicate categories such as tandem duplication, translocation, deletion, and inversion. The layout effectively combines color and spatial position to represent complex genomic relationships.
