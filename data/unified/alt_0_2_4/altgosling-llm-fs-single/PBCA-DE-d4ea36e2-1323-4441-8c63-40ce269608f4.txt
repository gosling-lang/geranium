A circular and linear genomic visualization illustrates diverse genomic data on the hg19 assembly. The circular view presents an ideogram track, indicating chromosome bands with distinct colors and a blue brush linked to the linear view. This view includes tracks like 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' displayed using blue and orange rectangles, plus a track for structural variations using colored connections. The associated linear view, displaying selected chromosome 1, features an ideogram with band patterns, putative driver genes annotated as text, and a scatterplot for point mutations with varying colors representing mutation types. Additional tracks cover insertions, deletions in rectangles, and a 'Copy Number Variants' track in grey, along with links showing different structural variants through color-coded connections. The setup enables analyzing genomic variations with interactive and categorized visual encodings.
