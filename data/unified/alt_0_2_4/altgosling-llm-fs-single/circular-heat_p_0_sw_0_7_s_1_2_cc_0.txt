The visualization is a circular heatmap depicting genomic data for chromosome 1, from position 1 to 3,000,500, using data from a multivec file. It displays four samples as separate rows, encoded with color intensity representing expression values. The color scale ranges from light to dark, indicating lower to higher values in the 'peak' field. The layout is circular with a center radius of 0.5, and quantity is visualized on a spectrum of hot colors. This design facilitates the viewing of genomic intervals and variations within a compact, circular layout. The title, “Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts,” and subtitle, “Heatmap,” describe the overall theme and type of data visualization.
