The visualization consists of a series of linear layouts displaying multivec data over chromosomes 1 to 5. Each section contains two tracks: an area chart representing expression data and an ideogram with cytogenetic band information. The area charts use different colors to differentiate between categories like 'sample 1' to 'sample 4.' The underlying ideograms use combinations of text, rectangles, and triangles to display chromosomal bands, with adjustments such as color filters to highlight specific stains. The visualization features specific domain adjustments for each chromosome, ensuring that each segment appropriately represents genomic data accurately.
