The visualization is a linear layout designed to showcase genomic links using a CSV file. Set on the hg38 assembly, the display focuses on chromosome 1, with genomic positions illustrated on the x-axis. The arcs, representing linked genomic positions, are styled in a green stroke. The chart is titled "Basic Marks: Link," and provides a concise tutorial example. The visualization's width is 1152 pixels, and it maintains a static, horizontal orientation with configurable zoom limits, allowing for detailed genomic examination.
