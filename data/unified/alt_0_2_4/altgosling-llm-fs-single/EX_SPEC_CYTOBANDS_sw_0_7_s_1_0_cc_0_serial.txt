The visualization is a linear arrangement of multi-channel area charts, depicting genomic data across chromosomes 1 to 5 in the hg38 assembly. Each area chart represents expression levels shown on the y-axis, with positions along each chromosome on the x-axis. The colors of the areas encode different sample categories, including blue, orange, green, and red. Below each area chart is an ideogram with text, rectangles, and triangles indicating cytogenetic bands. The rectangles have varying shades of gray to black, indicating different band densities, while the maroon triangles mark centromeric regions.
