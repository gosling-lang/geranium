The visualization titled "Custom Mouse Events" illustrates genomic data with mouse interaction capabilities in a linear layout across five distinct tracks. The first three tracks display multivec data as bar charts, each colored by sample categories and positioned along chromosome 1. These tracks enable user interaction, allowing hover and range selection with varying brush colors, providing visual feedback in blue, red, and other colors depending on the interaction type.

The fourth track, "Group Marks By Gene," focuses on chromosome 3, presenting a gene annotation with text labels. This track employs interactive elements tailored for gene-related data, with mouse events configured to alter visualization upon interaction.

The final track, "Group Marks By Chromosome," presents an ideogram of chromosomes 1 through 5 with labels and annotations represented by colored rectangles and trianglesâ€”indicative of cytogenetic bands and density. This track also supports rich interactive features, enabling grouping based on chromosomes when user interactions occur. Overall, this visualization effectively combines genomic data representation with customized user interactivity for enhanced data exploration.
