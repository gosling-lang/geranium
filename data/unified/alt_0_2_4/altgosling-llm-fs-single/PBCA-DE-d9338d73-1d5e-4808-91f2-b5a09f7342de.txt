A circular view and a linear view are arranged vertically and linked by an interactive brush in the circular view. The circular view shows the genome with tracks including an ideogram, text annotations, genomic ranges, and line connections. Key tracks are 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' showing data in sky blue and orange, respectively. The linear view details chromosome 1, featuring an ideogram, genetic annotations, a scatter plot 'Point Mutation,' and copy number variants. Colors represent mutation types and structural variations.
