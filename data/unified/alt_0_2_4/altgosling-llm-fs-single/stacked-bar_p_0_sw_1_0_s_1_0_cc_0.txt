The visualization is a linear, vertically arranged bar chart displaying multivec data for chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 with a center radius of 0.8. It features genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peaks on the y-axis, with gridlines and a legend indicating categories through color. Four samples are color-coded in blue, orange, green, and red. Tooltip data includes start and end genomic positions, peak values, and sample categories. The chart is rendered in hg38 assembly with a 600x160 dimension.
