A circular bar chart and two linear bar charts visualize genomic data from a multivec file. The circular chart shows chromosomal intervals with bars for categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4' across various chromosomes, colored in blue, orange, green, and red. Overlaid connections illustrate genomic rearrangements between selected chromosomes, with connections colored green and categorized by 'deletion', 'inversion', 'translocation', and 'tandem-duplication.' Two linear bar charts focus on chromosomes 5 and 16, providing detailed views with interactive brush selections linking to the circular view. The title and subtitle are absent, but the assembly used is 'hg38'.
