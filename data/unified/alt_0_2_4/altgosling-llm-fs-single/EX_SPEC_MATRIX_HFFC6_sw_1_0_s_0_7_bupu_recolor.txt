A horizontal layout matrix visualization compares Micro-C and Hi-C data for HFFc6 cells, focusing on chromosome 7 from approximately 77,700,000 to 81,000,000. The visualization includes multiple vertical and horizontal bar tracks representing different datasets, such as H3K4me3, ATAC, and CTCF, each encoded with distinct colors like purple, dark green, and orange. These tracks use bigWig data to show genomic intervals, while annotation tracks utilize BED data to differentiate strand directions with pink and green triangles. Additionally, matrix tracks display chromatin interactions with a color gradient in the 'bupu' range, emphasizing quantitative differences. The Epilogos track categorizes data with multi-color bars. This setup allows a comprehensive analysis of genomic interactions and expression levels across various conditions.
