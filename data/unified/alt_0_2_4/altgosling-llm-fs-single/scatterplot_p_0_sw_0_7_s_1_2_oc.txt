A point chart in a linear layout visualizes data from a multivec file, displaying chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. Each point represents 'peak' values, with size and position encoding quantitative data. Points are colored by categories 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', shown with a legend. The chart features a transparent style and includes a tooltip that details genomic positions and peak values.
