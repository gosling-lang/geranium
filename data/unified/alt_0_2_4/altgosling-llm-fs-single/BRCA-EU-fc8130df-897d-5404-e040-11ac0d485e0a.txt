The visualization features a circular and a linear genomic view, linked by an interactive brush. The circular view displays the entire genome as an ideogram with additional tracks: a labeled point track showing putative driver genes, two range annotation tracks depicting genomic gains and losses, and a line-connection track illustrating structural variations in different colors coded by type. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, including ideograms, gene annotations, a point mutation scatter plot, and additional range annotations for insertions, deletions, and copy number variants. The connections and categories in the circular view are visually distinguished by color and stroke variations, highlighting different types of genomic variations.
