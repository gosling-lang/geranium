This visualization features two horizontally arranged circular charts, displaying genomic data from chromosome 1 over an interval of 3,000,500 base pairs. On the left, a circular bar chart represents expression values on the y-axis with bars, categorized by color into four samples. The right chart combines a circular line chart and a circular scatter plot, stratified by rows representing different samples. Expression values are shown on the y-axis with lines and points, and point sizes vary based on expression values. Each category is distinguished by its color in both line and point representations, with interactive tooltips providing genomic positions, values, and sample information.
