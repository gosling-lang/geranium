A circular view and a linear view are displayed in a vertical arrangement with an interactive blue brush to link them. The circular view covers the entire human genome (hg19) and includes multiple tracks: an ideogram and annotation tracks. It visualizes datasets such as genomic ranges (blue for 'Gain' and orange for 'Loss of Heterozygosity' or LOH), text annotations for putative driver genes, and connection paths illustrating structural variations like translocations and inversions. The connections and annotations are color-coded by structural variant types, including translocation, duplication, deletion, and inversion. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1. It has similar tracks as the circular view and additional ones, such as a scatter plot of point mutations, with colors representing various nucleotide changes, and copy number variants displayed as gray rectangles. The scatter plot's exploration of a VCF file shows mutation distribution, with higher Y-axis values indicating greater distances between mutations. The interactive design allows exploration by zooming and panning specific genomic regions.
