A multi-row bar chart in a linear layout visualizes genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500 using a multivec file. The data is displayed across four rows, each representing a sample: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is shown in a distinct color: blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis shows genomic intervals, and the y-axis represents the minimum and maximum expression values ('peak_min' and 'peak_max') for each bin. The bars have a black outline with a stroke width of 0.2. Tooltip information includes position, minimum, and maximum peak values and sample identification. The chart utilizes hg38 assembly for the genomic data.
