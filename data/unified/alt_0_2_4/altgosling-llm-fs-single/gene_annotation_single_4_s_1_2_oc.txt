The visualization is a linear genomic range annotation track titled "GmGDV," focusing on chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. It shows gene annotations using text labels, right and left triangles for gene directions, rectangles for exons, and lines for entire gene spans. The track distinguishes forward and reverse strands by stratifying rows and using blue and red colors, respectively, to enhance clarity for genomic orientation and gene location.
