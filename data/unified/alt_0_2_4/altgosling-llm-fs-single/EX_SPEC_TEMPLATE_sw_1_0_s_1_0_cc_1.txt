The visualization presents a linear layout using track templates in Gosling.js. It consists of multiple genomic tracks arranged vertically for chromosome regions. The first track is a gene annotation view for chromosome 3, showing genomic features like exons and genes with directional arrows in gray. The second track focuses on a detailed sequence view of chromosome 1, displaying nucleotide counts with colored bars for bases A, T, G, and C. The third track is an ideogram representing the full chromosome 1, with dark and light banding patterns indicating cytogenetic bands. The visualization emphasizes ease of complex design using Gosling.js track templates.
