A genomic visualization titled "Gremlin (O'Brien et al. 2010)" presents a detailed analysis of chromosome 5 using several linked views. The main linear view, titled "Chromosome 5," spans from 0 to 80,000,000 base pairs. It consists of an ideogram with labels and categorized banding patterns, with a pink highlight for selective regions. Overlaying tracks display colored connections representing genomic relationships.

Below, two additional linear views, aligned vertically, focus on specific regions. The "Region of Interest" view displays a detailed section between 68,000,000 and 71,000,000 base pairs with connections distinguished by stroke colors. The "Rearrangement View" further zooms in, depicting rearrangements in a 60,000 base pair range, with blue arcs illustrating specific genomic positions. This visualization uses colors to differentiate categories and includes interactive elements such as brushes linking related views for dynamic exploration.
