The visualization consists of two vertically arranged tracks using a linear layout, focusing on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a bar chart visualizing a multivec dataset, where each bar height represents the peak value from samples 1 to 4, colored in various shades (blue for sample 1, orange for sample 2, green for sample 3, and red for sample 4). The x-axis represents genomic positions, and the y-axis displays quantitative peak values, with grid lines for clarity. The chart includes tooltips providing genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample names.

The bottom track features both line and area charts overlaying the same data, stratified by samples. Each line and area in the chart corresponds to a different sample, maintaining the same color scheme as the top track. The area beneath each line is shaded, with the size axis representing peak height. Tooltips here also provide additional insights into sample data and genomic positions. Both tracks include legends explaining the sample colors and categories, allowing for easy comparison across genomic positions.
