The visualization comprises a circular and a linear view arranged vertically and interconnected by an interactive brush on the circular ideogram. The circular view displays the entire genome with tracks including "Ideogram," "Gain," and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" annotated by color-coded rectangles. Structural rearrangements are shown as connections, categorized by types such as "Translocation" and "Inversion." The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, providing detailed genomic annotations such as gene positions and point mutations. These are represented with text labels, colored scatter points, and rectangles, indicating variations like "Insertion" and "Deletion." The integration allows for comprehensive genomic insights aligned along coordinating axes.
