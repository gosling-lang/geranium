The visualization includes a circular view and a linear view arranged vertically. The circular view displays the entire genome with an ideogram as one of the tracks. In addition to the ideogram, it features tracks with genomic annotations for categories like 'Gain' (in blue) and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' (in orange). The connections between genomic positions, shown as lines in different colors, represent various structural variations like 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion'.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, linked interactively with the circular view using a blue brush. It consists of multiple tracks including an ideogram, annotation tracks, a gene annotation track, and a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' which depicts the distance to previous mutations. This plot uses a VCF file where each point's color represents mutational subtype. Additional tracks show copy number variants and various mutation types like insertions and deletions, visualized with colored rectangles.
