The visualization is a linear layout depicting genomic data for chromosome 1, between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. It includes seven individual tracks alternating between rectangles and connections, visualizing a CSV file. Rectangles represent genomic intervals, colored pink for s1-e1 regions and sky blue for s2-e2 regions. The connections, or links, are drawn between these intervals, shown in purple for s1-e1 to s2-e2 connections and sky blue for s2-e2 to s1-e1. The tracks utilize strokes in olive green, with a transparency setting for finer visualization of overlapping data. The primary data source is a CSV file, specifically designed for genomic analysis, and the assembly used is hg38.
