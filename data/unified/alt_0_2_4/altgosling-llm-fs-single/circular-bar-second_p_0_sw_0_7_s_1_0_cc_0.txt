The visualization is a circular bar chart displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, covering the interval from 1 to 3,000,500. This chart uses a circular layout with vertical arrangement and a center radius of 0.5, while maintaining a static representation. The bars illustrate expression data along the y-axis for different samples, stratified into rows, with each category represented by distinct colors. The color scheme includes hues such as blue, orange, green, and red, corresponding to sample 1, sample 2, sample 3, and sample 4, respectively. The data originates from a multivec file, which is labeled 'hg38'. The track provides a tooltip that highlights details such as genomic start and end positions and quantitative value, mapped against a horizontal top x-axis.
