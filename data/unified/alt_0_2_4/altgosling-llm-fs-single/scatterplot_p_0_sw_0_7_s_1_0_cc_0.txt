The visualization is a linear scatter plot depicting genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis encodes quantitative 'peak' values. Points vary in size and intensity according to peak values, with color distinguishing four nominal categories: 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' The color palette includes shades of blue, orange, green, and red. This plot also includes a tooltip feature providing additional data details, such as start and end positions, values, and sample names, enhancing the interactivity and informativeness of the visualization.
