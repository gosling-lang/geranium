A linear layout visualization displays genomic data across chromosome 1, between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The top track illustrates a bar chart with genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis. It is stratified into four rows, representing 'sample 1' to 'sample 4', with each row colored uniquely to indicate different categories. The bottom track presents a heat map encoding expression values through color intensity, also divided into four rows corresponding to each sample. The tracks facilitate comparisons across samples, with detailed information accessible via tooltips for start and end positions, peak values, and sample identifiers.
