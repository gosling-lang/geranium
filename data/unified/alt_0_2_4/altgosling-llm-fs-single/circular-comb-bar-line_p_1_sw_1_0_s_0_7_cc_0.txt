The visualization is a circular representation of genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. It features two main tracks. The left track combines a circular line chart and a scatter plot, both representing expression values (peaks) along the genomic positions for four samples. The samples are distinguished by color: blue, orange, green, and red. The lines and points in the left track are stratified by rows for each sample, with the size of the points indicating the magnitude of expression.

The right track is a circular bar chart, where genomic positions are on the x-axis, and expression values are depicted by the height of the bars on the y-axis. The bars are color-coded by sample, using the same color scheme as the left track. The visualization also includes tooltips that provide genomic position, peak value, and sample information for interactive exploration.
