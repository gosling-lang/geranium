A dual representation links a circular and a linear view of the genome with an interactive brush. The circular view, displaying the entire human genome, features tracks for ideograms, annotated genes, and genomic variations such as 'Gain' (blue) and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' (orange). Connections show structural variants, color-coded by type. The linear view zooms into chromosome 1, with detailed ideograms, gene annotations, and a scatterplot for point mutations, showing variation distances. Tracks for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' highlight genomic changes, with bars representing 'Copy Number Variants.'
