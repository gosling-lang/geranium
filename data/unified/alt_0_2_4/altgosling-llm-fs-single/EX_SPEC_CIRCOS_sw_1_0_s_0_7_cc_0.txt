A circular layout visualization titled "Circos" displays three main tracks. The outermost track is a bar chart, mapping genomic positions on the x-axis with corresponding expression values on the y-axis, illustrated in pink. The middle track is a rect-based ideogram, manifested with colored rectangles representing different chromosome stains. The innermost track presents connections between genomic positions, with links colored to depict different categories of structural variations. The visualization utilizes data in CSV and vector formats, representing human genome data with a focus on the hg38 assembly, offering interactive genomic insights with a polished aesthetic.
