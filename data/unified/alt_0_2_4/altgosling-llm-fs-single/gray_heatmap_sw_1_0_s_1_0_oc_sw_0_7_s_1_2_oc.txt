A heat map in a linear layout visualizes a matrix with genomic data from hg38. The x-axis and y-axis both represent genomic positions, displaying intervals across different chromosomes. Color intensity encodes quantitative values, with shades of grey indicating expression levels. The layout is static, and the track contains a matrix data type. The x-axis appears on the top, and the y-axis is on the left. The visualization helps in exploring genomic patterns across chromosomes.
