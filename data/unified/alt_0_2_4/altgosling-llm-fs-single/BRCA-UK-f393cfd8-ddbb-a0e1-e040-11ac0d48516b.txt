The visualization comprises a circular and a linear view linked by an interactive brush. The circular view displays the entire genome in a series of tracks: an ideogram, a point annotation track, range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' and a line-connection track. The ideogram uses rectangles to represent different chromosome bands, with a color scheme for various categories. The point annotation track shows genetic data expressed as text annotations. The range annotation tracks highlight genomic intervals in sky blue and dark orange, respectively.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and includes multiple tracks such as an ideogram, a chart with text annotations for potential genetic drivers, and a gene annotation track with genomic features like exons and gene names. A scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' presents mutations as points plotted by genomic position, each colored according to mutation subtype.

Both views share a connection track, displaying structural variations like translocations, duplications, deletions, and inversions. Lines and connections are used to signify these variations, with color and stroke indicating specific structural variation categories. The visualization is interactive, offering detailed tooltips for exploring data specifics.
