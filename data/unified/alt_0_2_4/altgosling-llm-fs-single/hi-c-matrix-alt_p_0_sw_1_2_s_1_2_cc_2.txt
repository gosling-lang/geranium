A comprehensive Hi-C matrix analysis in a linear layout, showcasing genomic interactions throughout a specified range between 800,000,000 and 1,800,000,000. Areas with high interaction frequencies, indicated by intense color shades within a 'hot' color range, highlight significant genomic contacts. The visualization integrates several layers: a genomic heat map, vertical and horizontal green annotation lines across specific regions, and plotted points that depict structural variations with varying sizes and pink hues. The title is "Hi-C Matrix," with the subtitle "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations."
