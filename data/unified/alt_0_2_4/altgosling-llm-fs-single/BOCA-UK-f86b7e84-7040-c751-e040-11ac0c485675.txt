A detailed genomic visualization comprising both circular and linear layouts. The circular view displays the entire human genome (hg19 assembly) and includes an ideogram with a blue interactive brush, text annotations for putative drivers, and tracks highlighting "Gain" in sky blue and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in dark orange. Lines within the circle indicate structural variations such as translocations and duplications. 

The linked linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and features tracks with various data types. An ideogram provides a genomic context at the top. Text annotations for putative drivers, colored in black, follow. A scatter plot, titled "Point Mutation," visualizes genomic positions where points are colored based on mutation subtypes like 'C>A' or 'T>G'. Genomic range annotation tracks offer insight into insertions and deletions depicted in yellow and green. Another track, titled "Copy Number Variants," uses gray bars to show quantitative copy number data. Additional "Gain" and "LOH" tracks mirror the circular layout, with corresponding colors. Throughout, categories are distinguishable by color coding in both the track designs and line connections.
