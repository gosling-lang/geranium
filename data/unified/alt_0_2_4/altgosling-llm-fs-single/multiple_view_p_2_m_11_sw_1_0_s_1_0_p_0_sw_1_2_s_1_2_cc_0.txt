A two-part visualization with a vertical arrangement demonstrates genomic data from chromosome 1. The top part consists of two tracks: a linear chart with an area plot, and a circular chart with line plots. Both feature interactive brushes linked to a detailed view below. 

The linear chart shows genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative 'peak' values on the y-axis, stratified by samples using distinct colors for each category: 'sample 1' (blue), 'sample 2' (orange), 'sample 3' (green), and 'sample 4' (red). 

The circular chart displays similar data with lines representing the genomic values, offering an alternative visual perspective. 

The lower part is a detailed linear scatter plot focusing on a specific region of chromosome 1 (160,000,000 to 200,000,000), highlighting individual 'peak' values for each sample category. 

The visualization highlights dynamic interactions, allowing users to modify the view with brushing to examine details more closely. The title is "Visual Linking" and includes a subtitle explaining the functionality of the brush interaction.
