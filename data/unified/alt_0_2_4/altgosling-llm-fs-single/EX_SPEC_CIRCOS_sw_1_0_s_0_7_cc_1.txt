A circular visualization using the Circos layout illustrates genomic data. The visualization consists of three tracks. The first is a bar chart displaying genomic positions, where expression values are encoded by the height of sky blue bars. The second track is a circular ideogram showing chromosomes with categories distinguished by different colors. The third track shows connections between genomic positions with links colored based on categorical data. Overall, the chart provides a detailed representation of genomic relationships across a full set of chromosomes.
