This visualization presents genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. It consists of two stacked tracks in a linear layout with a vertical arrangement. The top track is a line chart depicting expression peaks, with genomic position on the x-axis and peak value on the y-axis. The lines are colored to represent four sample categories, each with a legend. The bottom track combines a line chart with a scatter plot, stratified by rows for each sample category. Points in the scatter plot vary in size based on peak values. Both tracks utilize multivec data with genomic positions linked across tracks.
