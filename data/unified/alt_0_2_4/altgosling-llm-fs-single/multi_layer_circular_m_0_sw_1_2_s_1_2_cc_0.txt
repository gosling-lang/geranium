A circular scatter plot visualizes a multivec file for chromosome 12, ranging from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000 base pairs. The plot displays data points organized into rows representing 16 samples, excluding "sample -", with each sample uniquely colored and positioned in a circular layout. The height of each point represents the 'peak' value, and the opacity varies with differing 'peak' value ranges. This design follows principles referenced from Javed et al.'s study on multiple time series perception, TVCG 2010.
