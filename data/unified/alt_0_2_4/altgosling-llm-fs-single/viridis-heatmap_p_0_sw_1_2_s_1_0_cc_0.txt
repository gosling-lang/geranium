This visualization presents a linear heatmap illustrating genomic intervals along the x-axis, spanning chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The data is encoded using a multivec file, and expression values are represented by color intensity varying from light to dark orange, indicating different peak values. The chart is stratified into four rows corresponding to the categories labeled 'sample 1' through 'sample 4.' Each row highlights distinct genomic features based on the intensity of the color, allowing for immediate visual comparison across samples. The tooltip provides detailed information, including start and end positions, peak value, and sample identifier.
