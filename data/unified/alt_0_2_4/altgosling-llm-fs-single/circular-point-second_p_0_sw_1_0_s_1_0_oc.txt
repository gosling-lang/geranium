A circular scatter plot presents genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from 1 to 3,000,500. The plot shows expression values marked as points, with size and color representing quantitative 'peak' values and categorical 'sample' data, respectively. Samples are identified by four colors: yellow, green, blue, and purple. Points are semi-transparent with an opacity of 0.5. The plot includes a legend indicating sample categories, and a genomic scale on the circumference, facilitating genomic position identification. The layout is static and circular, with a centered radius.
