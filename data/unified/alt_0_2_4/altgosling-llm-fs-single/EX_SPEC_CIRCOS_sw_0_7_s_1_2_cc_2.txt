A circular visualization, titled "Circos," displays genomic data using multiple tracks in a stacked alignment. The outermost track represents a circular bar chart of genomic positions, using sky blue to depict quantitative peaks. An ideogram track below it uses different colored rectangles to indicate various stain categories. The central portion features connections between genomic regions, with links encoded by color to represent different chromosome pairs, where colors range from orange to green, blue, and more. The entire visualization is static, following a circular layout to span the genome.
