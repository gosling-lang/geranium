The visualization is a line chart in a linear layout, depicting genomic data across the human genome (hg38). The x-axis represents genomic positions across chromosomes, while the y-axis quantifies expression values, using a data field named 'peak'. The line is colored light purple and measures a size of 2 units, with the chart titled 'Basic Marks: line' and a subtitle of 'Tutorial Examples'.
