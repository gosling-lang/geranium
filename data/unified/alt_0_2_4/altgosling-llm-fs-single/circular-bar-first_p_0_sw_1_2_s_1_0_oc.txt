A circular bar chart displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, covering the interval from 1 to 3,000,500. The chart represents quantitative values (peaks) for samples 1 to 4 using colored bars: yellow, green, blue, and pink. The position on the x-axis is defined by genomic position, and expression values on the y-axis include grid lines. Categories are distinguished by color, with an interactive legend indicating samples. The layout is circular with vertical arrangement, designed for static visualizations.
