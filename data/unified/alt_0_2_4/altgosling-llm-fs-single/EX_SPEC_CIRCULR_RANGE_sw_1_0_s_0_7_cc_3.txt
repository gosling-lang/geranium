Based on the specifications and processed attributes provided, the visualization can be described as follows:

A circular bar chart visualizes genomic data using a vector file, displayed in a stacked layout. The genome is presented on the x-axis as a complete circle encompassing various chromosomes, while the y-axis represents quantitative values denoted by "peak." Each bar radiates outward, forming a circle, and is colored green for easy differentiation. The title and additional metadata are absent, making the focus solely on the genomic peaks' visualization. The layout is static, ensuring consistent representation without user interaction, with a center radius creating a hollow inner circle to emphasize the circular design and align with the horizontal orientation.
