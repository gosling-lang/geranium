The visualization consists of two circular charts. The left chart is a circular heat map displaying genomic intervals from chromosome 1 between 1 and 3,000,500 on the x-axis. The color intensity encodes expression values, stratified by rows for categories labeled as 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'. The right chart is a circular bar chart showing the same genomic intervals on the x-axis, with expression values represented by the height of bars on the y-axis. The chart is stratified by rows for the samples, and each is colored distinctly, corresponding to a legend displaying the sample categories. The layout is static and arranged vertically in a circular format with a center radius of 0.5.
