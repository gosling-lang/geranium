The visualization consists of a circular view and a linear view stacked vertically. The circular view includes five tracks: an ideogram, a text annotation track titled "Putative Driver," two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and a line-connection track representing structural variations. The text track annotates genetic locations with gene names. The range tracks highlight segments of the genome in different colors, with blue representing "Gain" and orange for "LOH." The line-connection track links genomic positions in various colors to indicate categories like 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' and 'Deletion.'

The linear view mirrors similar content but focuses on chromosome 1. It includes additional features: a gene annotation track that displays gene structures with labels, a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" showing variant calls, and another track for copy number variations represented by gray bars. The scatter plot marks each mutation point with colors reflecting the mutation subtype, such as 'C>A' or 'T>G.' 

A blue interactive brush in the circular view links both views, allowing for synchronized investigation of the genome across multiple representations. This visualization uses the hg19 assembly, providing a comprehensive view of genomic data with emphasis on structural and mutation variance.
