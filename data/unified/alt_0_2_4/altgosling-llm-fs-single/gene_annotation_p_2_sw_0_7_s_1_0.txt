A series of six genomic range tracks arranged in a linear horizontal layout display different annotations of chromosome 3, between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. 

- The first track, titled "Cyverse-QUBES," shows gene annotations using black text for gene names, light gray rectangles for genes, and purple rectangles with darker outlines for exons. Directionality is indicated with gray triangles.
  
- The second track displays a comprehensive genomic annotation with gray, red, and cyan rectangles representing genes, exons, and introns respectively.

- The third, "GmGDV," utilizes colored text, triangles, and rectangles to denote genes and exons, with directional indicators. Blue is used for positive strands and red for negative strands.

- "HiGlass" employs a similar approach with blue and red used to signify strand directions, enhancing clarity with opacity adjustments.

- "IGV" emphasizes gene names and locations with navy blue features, applying white directional lines for strand indication.

- Finally, "Corces et al." uses a combination of blue and red to signify strand direction, with rectangles and text for gene and exon visualization.

Each track is stratified by strand, offering detailed insights into gene structure and transcriptional orientation on the hg38 assembly.
