A multi-row, color-coded bar chart displays a multivec file in a linear layout, visualizing data for chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. Each row corresponds to different samples, excluding a filtered category labeled 'sample -'. The y-axis shows quantitative peak values, while colors distinguish samples. Visibility adjusts based on height to manage opacity and stratification. The visualization refers to Javed et al.'s research on graphical perception, ensuring responsive height adjustments. This detailed representation allows for in-depth analysis of genomic data patterns across multiple sample categories.
