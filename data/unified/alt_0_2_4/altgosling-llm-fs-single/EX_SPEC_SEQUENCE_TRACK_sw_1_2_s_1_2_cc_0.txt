A vertical arrangement displays a linear bar chart showing DNA base composition on chromosome 1, from position 3,000,000 to 3,000,010. Each bar's height reflects the count of bases 'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C', with corresponding colors: blue, orange, green, and red. Text annotations highlight bases directly within the chart, colored white for visibility. The chart facilitates genomic analysis, emphasizing base abundance across the specified interval.
