The visualization presents a dual-track genomic dashboard in a linear layout, focusing on chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The upper track features a multi-row bar chart showing minimum and maximum peak values for four samples, each represented by different colored barsâ€”blue, orange, green, and red. The lower track illustrates an area chart delineating quantitative gene expression data for the same four samples, also color-coded. Both tracks are stratified by rows corresponding to the nominal sample category.

Tooltips provide detailed insights, showing genomic position, min/max peak values, and sample identification. The visualization utilizes a multivec data type, with interactivity enabled through tooltips. Colors are consistent across tracks, aiding in cross-reference and comparative analysis.
