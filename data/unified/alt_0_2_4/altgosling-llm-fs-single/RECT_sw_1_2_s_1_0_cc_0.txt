**Description**: 

A linear ideogram, titled "Basic Marks: Rect," visualizes genomic data in the chromosomal domain of chromosome 1 in hg38 assembly. The ideogram uses a bar chart format, where colorful rectangles represent various chromosomal stain types. These categories are indicated by colors: blues, oranges, greens, reds, purples, and browns. The x-axis displays genomic intervals on chromosome 1, showing positional information in genomic coordinates. Rectangles are defined by their start and end positions, with a gray stroke outlining each rectangle. The visualization enhances genome annotation understanding by offering a categorized view of chromosomal bands using vivid colors.
