A detailed genomic visualization is presented with a circular and a linear layout. The circular view encapsulates the entire hg19 genome, featuring an ideogram with stain patterns, a 'Putative Driver' text track, two genomic range tracks titled 'Gain' in sky blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in dark orange, and a connections track illustrating structural variants. These connections, reflecting different structural classes, are colored based on 'svclass' categories such as 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' 'Inversion (TtT),' and 'Inversion (HtH).' An interactive brush links this circular view to the corresponding chromosome 1 region in the linear view below.

The linear view is more detailed for chromosome 1, with an ideogram providing chromosomal context. 'Putative Driver' annotations are textually represented with position-based gene labels. A scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' highlights the distance to previous mutations with color-coded points representing different 'SUBTYPE' categories (e.g., C>A, C>G). Gene annotations are displayed vertically with strand-based orientation, while a VCF-based track distinguishes 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' events, marked in separate colors. The track titled 'Copy Number Variants' outlines quantitative changes in copy number, visualized as light-grey rectangles. All components are styled with light gray outlines to emphasize features distinctly.
