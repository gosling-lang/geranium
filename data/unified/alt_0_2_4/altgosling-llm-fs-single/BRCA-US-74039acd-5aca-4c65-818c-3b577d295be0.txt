The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view, showing genomic data for the hg19 assembly. The circular view includes an ideogram, highlighting the entire genome with interactive brushing for chromosome selection. It features tracks for 'Putative Driver' annotations, 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' regions, visualized with colored rectanglesâ€”sky blue and dark orange respectively. The 'Gain' and 'LOH' tracks display structural variations with connections in various colors, such as light grey and teal, indicating categories like 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' and 'Inversion.'

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, providing a more detailed analysis with tracks similar to those in the circular view, as well as additional tracks like a point mutation scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation.' This plot illustrates mutation subtypes with colored points, based on their distance to the previous mutation. Further, it provides tracks for 'Copy Number Variants,' 'Insertion,' and 'Deletion,' using shades of gray, blue, and orange to represent genomic changes. This comprehensive and interactive layout offers insights into genetic alterations and structural changes.
