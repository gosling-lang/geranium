A bar chart visualizes genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The layout is linear and vertically arranged. Each bar represents the expression values for samples categorized into four groups: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The x-axis displays genomic positions, while the y-axis shows quantitative expression levels with grid lines for clarity. The bars are colored according to their respective sample categories, as indicated by the legend. Interactive tooltips provide additional data details, including start and end genomic positions, expression values, and sample names. The assembly version used is hg38.
