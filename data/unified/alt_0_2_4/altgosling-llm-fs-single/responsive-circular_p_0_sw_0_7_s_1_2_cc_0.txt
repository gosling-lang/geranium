The visualization is a circular bar chart showing genomic data for chromosome 12, spanning the interval from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The chart features multiple concentric rows categorized by sample names, with each sample represented by a different color. The height of the bars indicates quantitative expression levels, and the bars are positioned based on genomic coordinates. The design includes various visibility settings and opacity changes depending on the chart height, providing a responsive view of the data. The visualization references a study on graphical perception of multiple time series, highlighting responsiveness in visual encoding.
