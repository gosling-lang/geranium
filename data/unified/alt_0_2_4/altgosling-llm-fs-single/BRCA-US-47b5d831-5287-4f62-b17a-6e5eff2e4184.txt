A circular and linear genomic visualization is arranged vertically, showcasing the human genome (hg19). The circular view includes an ideogram with linked genomic intervals using a light blue brush, a text annotation track titled "Putative Driver," and multiple range annotation tracks. These range tracks highlight genomic events with colors indicating categories such as "Gain" (sky blue) and "Loss of Heterozygosity" (dark orange). A connection track visualizes structural variations with links colored by structural variation type, including translocations and inversions.

The linear view expands on chromosome 1 with tracks showing ideograms, text annotations (also titled "Putative Driver"), and point annotations for "Point Mutation" using VCF data, with colors representing mutation subtypes. Additional tracks indicate insertions and deletions using rectangles, and a track named "Copy Number Variants" uses light grey rectangles to show total copy number. The visualization features design elements like dashed connection lines and triangular marks that enhance readability and interactivity.
