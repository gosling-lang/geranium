The visualization is divided into two tracks within a linear layout. The top track displays a bar chart that represents genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. Expression levels are shown on the y-axis, stratified by category rows ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'), each distinguished by unique colors like blue, orange, green, and red. This track uses bars to convey quantitative data (peak values) per genomic position. The bottom track, a heat map, presents intervals of genomic data along the x-axis. Here, peak values are represented through color intensity, again stratified by sample categories. The color gradient ranges between light to dark shades, encoding the expression value intensity. Both tracks utilize a multivec file for data input, ensuring consistency across samples and visual representation.
