A visualization featuring a horizontal arrangement of three linear bar charts, each displaying genomic data from a multivec file. The first two charts present data for chromosome 12 with intervals between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000, marked in purple. The third chart shows chromosome 9 within the same interval, colored in pink. Each chartâ€™s x-axis represents genomic intervals, while the y-axis quantifies 'peak' values. The layout adapts responsively, switching to a vertical arrangement for narrower displays, linked by a shared interaction ID. The stroke surrounding the bars is white.
