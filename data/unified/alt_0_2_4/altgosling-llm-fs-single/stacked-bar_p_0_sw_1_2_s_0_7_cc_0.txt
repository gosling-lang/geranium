A linear bar chart visualizes multivec data for chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The x-axis shows genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative peak values. The chart includes four samples, distinguished by colors: blue, orange, green, and red. A legend indicates each sample's category. The width is approximately 504 pixels, with a height of 121 pixels. Grid lines enhance readability, and tooltips provide detailed genomic positions and peak values for each bar.
