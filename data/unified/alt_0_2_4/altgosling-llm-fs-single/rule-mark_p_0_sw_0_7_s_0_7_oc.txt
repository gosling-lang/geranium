A linear layout with overlaid tracks visualizes genomic data from a multivec file. The chart, titled "Rule Mark" with the subtitle "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines," features lightgray bars representing the 'peak' variable, using the genomic start and end as the x-axis. Overlaid on the bar chart, red and blue dashed rules indicate specific genomic positions and values on both quantitative and strokeWidth-axes. Red rules represent quantitative values, while blue rules emphasize specific genome positions, providing annotations within the range of chromosome 2, 5, and 10.
