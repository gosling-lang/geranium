The visualization showcases a circular and a linear genomic layout of the hg19 assembly. The circular view includes an ideogram with chromosome bands, a track titled "Putative Driver" displaying text annotations, and two range annotation tracks: one showing genomic regions with "Gain" in sky blue and another with "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in dark orange. The circular links between genomic positions are colored based on structural variant types like "Translocation," "Duplication," and "Inversion."

In the linear view, the chromosome 1 region is detailed. The ideogram provides a banded chromosome representation at the top. Below it, the "Putative Driver" track shows text annotations for driver genes. The linear scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" visualizes VCF data, with points colored by mutation subtype (e.g., C>A, C>G). Below, a separate track displays "Insertion" and "Deletion" variants as green and yellow rectangles, respectively. The "Copy Number Variants" track visualizes quantitative data, with bars representing total copy numbers in gray.

Both views are interactively linked by a brush feature, allowing exploration of the genomic intervals across the visualizations.
