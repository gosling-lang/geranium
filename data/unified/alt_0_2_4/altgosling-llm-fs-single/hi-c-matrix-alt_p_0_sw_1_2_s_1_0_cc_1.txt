The visualization titled "Hi-C Matrix" with the subtitle "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations" displays genomic information in a linear layout. The x-axis represents genomic intervals from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000, while both x and y axes of the matrix show genomic data with intervals. The track overlays multiple data inputs, showcasing a matrix where expression values are encoded using a color intensity range labeled "hot." Green lines represent annotated rule data that intersect the plot both vertically and horizontally. Additional elements include purple points sized according to a quantitative field, emphasizing specific genomic features across chromosomes 6, 7, and 8. The matrix displays the entire genome in the assembly hg38.
