A linear area chart visualizes a multivec file, showing the entire genome of hg38. The 'position' is mapped to the x-axis and 'peak' values to the y-axis, with the size of the area set to 2. The chart's title is 'Basic Marks: area' with the subtitle 'Tutorial Examples.' The chart's color is orange, highlighting genomic data distribution across chromosomes, displayed from chr1 to chr22 on the x-axis.
