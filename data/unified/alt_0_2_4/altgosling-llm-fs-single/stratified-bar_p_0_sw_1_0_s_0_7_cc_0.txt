This linear bar chart visualizes genomic data from a multivec file. It displays chromosome 1, from position 1 to 3,000,500. The chart is organized into four rows representing different samples labeled 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' Each sample row consists of bars indicating expression values (peaks), color-coded in blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The bars represent quantitative data, with their height corresponding to the 'peak' values. The x-axis denotes genomic positions, and a tooltip provides detailed information, including start and end positions, peak value, and sample name.
