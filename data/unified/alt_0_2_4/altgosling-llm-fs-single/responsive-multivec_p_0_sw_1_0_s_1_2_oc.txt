This visualization is a responsive bar chart using a linear layout to represent genomic data from chromosome 12, spanning from position 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. It encodes data from a multivec file, with expression levels visualized as bars along the y-axis and genomic positions along the x-axis. The chart is stratified by categories, with each category represented by a distinct color. The width of the bars is responsive, and various levels of opacity are applied based on the height of the track to maintain visual clarity. The data is filtered to exclude certain samples, ensuring the visualization remains focused on relevant information. This view relies on hg38 assembly and offers interactive elements to enhance user exploration of different genomic regions.
