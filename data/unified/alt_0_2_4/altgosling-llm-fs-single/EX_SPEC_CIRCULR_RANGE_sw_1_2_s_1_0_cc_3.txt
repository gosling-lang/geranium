A circular bar chart visualizes a vector data file, displaying the entire genome using the hg38 assembly. The chart is designed with a circular layout and stacks bars to represent quantitative values along the y-axis, where the data field named 'peak' is encoded. The x-axis denotes genomic positions, and the bars are uniformly colored in green. The visualization spans 840 pixels in width and height. The chart is static and incorporates a center radius of 0.3.
