A circular visualization in a vertical arrangement contrasts two genomic data tracks on chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. The left track overlays a circular line chart and a circular scatter plot, where lines and points represent 'peak' values of samples 1 to 4. Each sample is distinguished by color, with the x-axis mapping genomic positions and the y-axis encoding expression values, augmented by a size axis for height representation. The right track displays a circular bar chart of 'peak' values, colored by sample, emphasizing categorical differentiation. The visualization provides interactive tooltips for detailed inspection, showcasing genomic data from a multivec file in an hg38 assembly context.
