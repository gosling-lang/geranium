The visualization consists of two views: a circular view and a linear view, linked by an interactive brush in the circular view. The circular view displays the entire genome using hg19 assembly with tracks for an ideogram, point annotations, two range annotations (titled 'Gain' in blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange), and a line connection track showing structural variations. These variations include categories such as 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion,' differentiated by color.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and contains similar tracks with additional details. These tracks include a gene annotation track, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' showing mutations from a VCF file, and tracks for structural mutations like insertions, deletions, and copy number variants (CNVs). Each structural variation is represented with distinct colors, and the scatter plot uses point color to represent mutation subtype. The brush in the circular view allows interaction between the two views, making it possible to examine detailed segments in the linear view based on genomic positions highlighted in the circular view.
