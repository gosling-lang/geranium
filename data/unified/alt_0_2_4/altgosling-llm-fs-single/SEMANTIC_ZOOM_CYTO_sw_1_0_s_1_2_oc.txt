The visualization is a linear ideogram that represents the human genome (assembly hg38) using a CSV file formatted dataset. The chart is titled "Example: Semantic Zooming" and subtitled "Text and triangle marks will show when zooming in to provide more details." It features rectangles, text labels, and triangular marks. Each chromosome is displayed along the x-axis, with intervals between 'chromStart' and 'chromEnd.' The color of rectangles varies by chromosome ('chr1' to 'chrY'), with categories shown in shades of gray or maroon triangles for 'p' and 'q' bands. Text marks provide further detail and are visible at specific zoom levels, enhancing detail focus. The chart adapts interactively as it zooms, aligning with the semantic zooming function stated in the title.
