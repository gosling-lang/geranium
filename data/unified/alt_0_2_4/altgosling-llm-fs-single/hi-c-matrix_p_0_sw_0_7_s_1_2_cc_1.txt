The visualization presents a comprehensive view of Hi-C data through a series of overlays, using a linear layout on the hg38 genome assembly. In this layout, genomic data spans the interval from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 base pairs, visualized across a matrix with various encoding methods. The core matrix chart displays genomic intervals on both axes, where the intensity of the color encodes the expression values, forming a heat map. This matrix is overlaid with multiple tracks.

The first overlay is a matrix track that reaffirms the genomic intervals with expression values, using color intensity against a light gray background. Subsequent overlays consist of charts with vertical and horizontal lines, indicating specific annotations. The vertical lines are depicted in purple, while pink is used for the horizontal lines. Another matrix overlay highlights different categories with distinct bar strokes.

Lastly, a point chart overlay visualizes discrete data points, with both axes representing genomic intervals. The size attribute of these points reflects the expression values, further emphasized by the color pink. The entire visualization series is styled with dashed lines for an aesthetic continuity among tracks, enhancing the distinction between different data layers without compromising the clarity of genomic insights across chromosomes 5 to 10. The title "Hi-C Matrix" and subtitle "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations" succinctly capture the visualization's essence.
