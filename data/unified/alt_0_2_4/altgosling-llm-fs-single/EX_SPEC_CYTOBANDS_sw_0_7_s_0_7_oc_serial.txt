The visualization displays a series of multi-track linear views covering chromosomes 1 to 5, encoded in a serial arrangement. Each view showcases an area chart representing genomic positions against peak expression levels, distinguished by sample categories using color encoding. Overlaying each area chart is an ideogram track featuring text, rectangles, and directional triangles that represent cytogenetic bands. Rectangles are colored based on density, while maroon triangles indicate acen regions. The visualization uses a multivec data source for plotting the area marks and a CSV file for the ideogram track, offering complementary genomic context across the chromosomes.
