The visualization consists of two vertically arranged tracks in a linear layout, displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is an area chart that shows peaks for four samples (sample 1 to sample 4) using distinct colors (blue, orange, green, red). Each sample is stacked in rows, allowing comparison of expression levels across genomic positions on the x-axis. The bottom track is a scatter plot displaying the same four samples with points sized according to peak values. Points are semi-transparent (opacity 0.5) and color-coded to match the sample identities, providing a detailed view of peak distribution and intensity. The visualization aids in analyzing trends and variations in genomic data, with interactive tooltips offering detailed information on start and end positions, peak values, and sample identifiers.
