The visualization is a linear arc plot titled "Visual Encoding" with the subtitle "Arcs." It displays genomic connections within a specified range on chromosome 1, from 1 to 3,000,500. The arcs represent data from a CSV file, detailing regions between 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. The arcs are colored nominally based on the start positions, with a black stroke for each connection for clarity. The plot uses low opacity to allow overlapping arcs, giving a detailed look at structural variations over the specified genomic interval.
