A genomic visualization combining a circular and a linear view represents the human genome assembly hg19. The circular ideogram allows interactive exploration with a blue brush, linking to the detailed view of chromosome 1 shown in the linear panel below. The circular panel includes five layers: an ideogram, a point annotation track for putative drivers, and two tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' displayed with sky blue and dark orange rectangles, respectively. Structural variations are shown as connections between genomic positions, color-coded by type.

The linear view further details chromosome 1 with nine tracks, including: an ideogram, a putative driver annotation, a gene annotation track showing gene structures with directional markers, a scatter plot for point mutations colored by subtype, and a range for insertions and deletions marked in specific colors. The view also includes 'Copy Number Variants,' visualized as bars where height indicates total copy number, and additional tracks for gain and LOH features in blue and orange. Interactivity is facilitated through tooltip annotations and responsive elements, allowing detailed genomic exploration.
