A linear visualization overlays multiple genomic data tracks using a Hi-C matrix, spanning genomic intervals from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000. The main matrix uses color intensity on a yellow to brown gradient to encode quantitative values. Vertical sky blue lines and horizontal purple lines annotate genomic positions on the matrix. Additional layers include bar charts depicting genomic data for chromosomes 6, 7, and 8, with stroke colors distinguishing categories. Pink points overlay the matrix, encoding additional quantitative values by size, with white strokes around each point to enhance visibility. The visualization's title is "Hi-C Matrix," with a subtitle, "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations," indicating its aim to provide detailed genomic interaction insights.
