A linear layout visualization displays genomic data across chromosome 1 using a CSV file. The visualization consists of five overlapping tracks:

1. **Ideogram Track**: Displays chromosome bands with colors corresponding to different band types like gneg, gpos, and acen. Triangles indicate p and q arms.

2. **Gene Annotation Track**: Shows gene positions with blue and orange triangles indicating strand direction (+/-). Tracks are arranged by strand categories.

3. **Chromosomal Copy Number Loss Track**: Highlights regions with chromosomal copy number loss in sky blue rectangles.

4. **Chromosomal Copy Number Gain Track**: Shows areas of increased copy number in green rectangles.

5. **Genomic Rearrangements Track**: Illustrates structural variations such as tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions using colored arcs, with different colors and strokes indicating specific variation types. 

The visualization effectively encodes genomic features like banding patterns, gene locations, and structural variations, supporting genomic data analysis.
