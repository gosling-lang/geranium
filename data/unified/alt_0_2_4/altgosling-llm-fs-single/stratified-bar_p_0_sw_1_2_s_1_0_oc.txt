The visualization is a multi-row bar chart in a linear vertical layout, displaying genomic data across chromosome 1 from base pair 1 to 3,000,500. The chart consists of four rows, each representing a different sample ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4'). Each row depicts the 'peak' values using bars of different colors to distinguish between samples. Genomic positions are displayed on the x-axis, while quantitative 'peak' values are shown on the y-axis. Tooltips provide additional details, including start and end positions, sample identity, and peak values with formatting up to two decimal places. The visualization uses the hg38 assembly for the genomic coordinate system.
