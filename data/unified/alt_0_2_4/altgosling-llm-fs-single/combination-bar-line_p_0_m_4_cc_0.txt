The visualization presents genomic data in a linear layout with two vertically arranged tracks, each showing information for chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a stacked bar chart where different colors represent four samples. Genomic positions are on the x-axis, while expression levels are depicted by the height of the bars on the y-axis. The bottom track combines a line chart and scatter plot, with points indicating expression peaks, stratified by rows for each sample. Colors are consistent across both tracks, aiding in comparing sample data. The chart includes interactive tooltips for detailed data exploration.
