A vertical layout displays four charts to demonstrate different BED file specifications, focusing on the first two million base pairs of chromosome 1. Each chart uses rectangular marks to represent genomic intervals. The first two tracks show BED12 and BED6 fields with green rectangles. The third track, labeled BED6+6, extends BED6 with additional custom fields displayed as pink rectangles. The fourth track, named BED12+1, combines all standard BED12 fields with an extra custom field, represented by purple rectangles. Each track uses consistent styling with black strokes around rectangles.
