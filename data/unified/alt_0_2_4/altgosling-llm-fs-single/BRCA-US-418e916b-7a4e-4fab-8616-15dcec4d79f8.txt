The visualization consists of two main views: a circular view and a linear view, linked by an interactive brush in the circular view, depicting genomic data. The circular view encompasses the entire hg19 genome and contains multiple tracks: an ideogram, a text-based track labeled "Putative Driver", and range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" which use blue and orange bars, respectively. It also features connection lines in various colors to represent different structural variations like Translocation, Duplication, and Inversion. The linear view, focusing on chromosome 1, includes similar tracks plus additional details such as a gene annotation track and a scatterplot titled "Point Mutation" showcasing variants in varied colors based on subtype. Other tracks display insertions and deletions, noted with yellow and green colors, and a "Copy Number Variants" track illustrating quantitative data. The visualization is arranged vertically in a linear layout with specified custom styling, including light gray outlines and interactive elements for enhanced exploration.
