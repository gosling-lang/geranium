The visualization comprises a circular and a linear genomic view, showcasing data from the hg19 assembly. The circular ideogram features a brush linking to the linear view, which focuses on chromosome 1. The circular tracks include genomic annotations such as gains in blue rectangles and losses of heterozygosity in orange. It also displays various structural variations using color-coded connections, representing categories like translocations, duplications, and inversions.

The linear view provides detailed annotations: an ideogram, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' visualizing VCF data, and copy number variations with gray bars. Additional tracks highlight insertions and deletions with distinct color schemes. This layout facilitates comprehensive analysis of genomic alterations across multiple visualization layers.
