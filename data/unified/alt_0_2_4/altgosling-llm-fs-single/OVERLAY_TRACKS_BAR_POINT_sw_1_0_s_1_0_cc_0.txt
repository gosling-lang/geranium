The visualization, titled "Example: Overlay Tracks," displays genomic data in a linear layout. It features an overlay of bar and point marks representing different significance categories from a BEDDB file. The data is specific to chromosome 3. Bars vary in height based on category, while points' colors depict distinct categories, including pathogenic and benign variations. Colors range from orange for pathogenic to green for benign. The visualization provides a comprehensive view of genomic significance across multiple intervals on chromosome 3, with an interactive color legend for reference.
