A vertical bar chart displays genomic data across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 in a linear layout. The chart is divided into four rows, each representing different 'sample' categories: 'sample 1' through 'sample 4.' Minimum and maximum expression values are represented by the height of the bars, with each sample coded in distinct colors - blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis shows genomic intervals, while the y-axis displays quantitative values. The inclusion of tooltip data and a legend facilitates data interpretation.
