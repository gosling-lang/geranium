The visualization features two overlaid genomic matrices displaying data on chromosome 10. Each matrix illustrates genomic intervals on both axes, with expression values represented using color intensity. The first matrix occupies the lower-left quadrant, utilizing a warm color range, while the second matrix fills the upper-right quadrant with a pink spectrum. These matrices, part of a larger linear layout, have adjustable size parameters and are linked by a common identifier to enable interaction and cross-referencing between datasets.
