A linear layout visualization displays a multivec dataset representing genomic positions with overlay tracks. The x-axis shows genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative values with bars. Categories 'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C' are color-coded, each associated with a unique color and legend. Text annotations appear dynamically when zooming into specific intervals, with white text indicating distinct categories on a dark background. The visualization enables interactive exploration, revealing base pair information at closer zoom levels. The title is "Example: Semantic Zooming" with a subtitle explaining the zoom feature.
