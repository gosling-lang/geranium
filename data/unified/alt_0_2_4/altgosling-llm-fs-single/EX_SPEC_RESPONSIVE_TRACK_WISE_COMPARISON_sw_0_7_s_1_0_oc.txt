A genomic visualization consisting of eight tracks, arranged vertically. It features two genomic range annotation tracks with gene and exon details, depicted using texts and shapes like triangles and rectangles. The tracks focus on chromosome 12 (10,140,000 to 10,210,000) and chromosome 8 (127,734,000 to 127,744,000). Six additional bar charts present quantitative peak data for three samples, each corresponding to specific genomic regions. The charts for chromosome 12 tracks are displayed in pink, while those for chromosome 8 are in orange, with high visual alignment facilitated by a consistent color scheme across annotations and expressions. The layout is optimized for responsiveness, with interactive linkages enabling focused exploration of genomic details.
