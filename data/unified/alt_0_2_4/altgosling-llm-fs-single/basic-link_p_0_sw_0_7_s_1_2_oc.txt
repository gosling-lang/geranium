A linear layout visualization, titled "Basic Marks: Link," displays connections within genomic data. It utilizes a CSV file representing genomic fields 's1', 'e1', 's2', and 'e2' on chromosome 1. The arcs are drawn between these positions, with a stroke color of steel blue. The visualization provides spatial genomic interval information on the x-axis, covering the chromosome 'chr1', highlighting comparative genomic data through arcs. The subtitle of the visualization is "Tutorial Examples," indicating its instructional purpose.
