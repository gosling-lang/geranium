The visualization, titled "Visual Linking," features a linked multi-view layout designed for interactive exploration. The top panel presents a scatter plot displaying chromosome 1 from position 160,000,000 to 200,000,000, with genomic data in four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Points are colored in blue, orange, green, and red.

Below, a circular line chart depicts chromosome 1 with lines in the same four colors. An interactive brush controls the detail view via position and range adjustments. The final view is a linear area chart showing the entire chromosome 1 overlaid with similarly colored areas, also controlled by the brush linking to the top scatter plot. This integration provides cohesive navigation and comparison across different genomic regions and data types.
