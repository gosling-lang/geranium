A linear layout features multiple tracks to visualize genomic data from CSV files. The first track, titled "Gap," displays a bar chart showing gap values with sky blue bars along the genomic axis. The second track, "Conservation," presents another bar chart with values shown in a heat map color range, indicating conservation levels. The third track overlays rectangles and text to display genomic data, with colors representing different categories and black text labeling. Lastly, a composite track combines rectangles and bars, enabling interactive exploration with a brush allowing zoom and selection. This visualization covers genomic intervals primarily between positions 350 and 396, without a specific genome assembly, referencing alignment charts from Dash Bio.
