A circular bar chart in a vertical arrangement displays genomic data from chromosome 1. The x-axis represents the genomic position from 1 to 3,000,500, while the y-axis shows quantitative "peak" values. The chart is color-coded to differentiate between four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The chart provides an overview of expression levels, with tooltips offering detailed genomic positions and peak values. The static layout ensures a consistent view across the specified genomic interval, with additional information accessible via an interactive tooltip.
