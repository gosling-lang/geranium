The visualization depicts genomic data in a vertical arrangement with nine individual charts. It features three genomic range annotation tracks with text and three charts with superimposed bars and points, as well as three standalone bar charts. The genomic range tracks, titled "HiGlass," represent genes and exons on chromosome 13, with text labels indicating gene names. The tracks are color-coded by strand direction, with right and left triangles and lines indicating the strand orientation.

The bar and point charts represent ClinVar data, with categories such as "Pathogenic" and "Benign" shown along the y-axis. These charts are color-coded and stratified by rows for different significance categories. Bar chart heights indicate the count of each category, and the colors of the points correspond to significance categories. The visualization is interactive, adjusting visibility based on zoom level, enhancing its utility for exploring specific genomic intervals.
