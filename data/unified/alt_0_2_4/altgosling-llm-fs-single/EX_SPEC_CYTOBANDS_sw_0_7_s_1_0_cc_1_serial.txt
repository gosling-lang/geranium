The visualization consists of a series of linear area charts arranged serially, each representing a different chromosome (chromosomes 1 to 5) using the hg38 assembly. These charts display genomic data from a multivec file, where the x-axis represents genomic positions and the y-axis shows quantitative expression values. The data is categorized into samples, with each category represented by distinct colors such as blue, orange, green, and red. The charts are overlaid with ideograms containing text, rectangles, and triangle markers, where rectangle colors indicate various densities and categories. Acen regions are marked with red triangles, and gvar regions are highlighted in purple. The layout maintains a consistent width across all views, with slight variations in height and color among the ideogram tracks to distinguish between chromosomes and categories.
