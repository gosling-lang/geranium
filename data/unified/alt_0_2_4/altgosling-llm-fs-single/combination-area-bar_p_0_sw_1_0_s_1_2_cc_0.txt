A linear arrangement of two genomic data visualizations displays the interval from 1 to 3,000,500 on chromosome 1 using hg38 assembly. The first track presents an area chart illustrating the values of the 'peak' field across four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is represented by a distinct color, including blue, orange, green, and red, with a white stroke outlining the areas. 

Below, a bar chart depicts the data for the same samples with bars representing the range between 'peak_min' and 'peak_max' values. The genomic positions are displayed on the x-axis, while the categorical data defines the rows, enhancing visual stratification. Each bar is outlined in black, and the data's categorical nature is further distinguished through the legend.
