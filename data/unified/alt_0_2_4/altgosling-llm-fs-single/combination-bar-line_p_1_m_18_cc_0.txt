The visualization is a linear layout with a vertical arrangement, displaying genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500 using a multivec file. The top chart is an overlay of line charts stratified by rows, showing genomic positions on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis. Each line corresponds to a category ('sample 1' to 'sample 4') with distinct colors. The line size varies based on the 'peak' value. The bottom chart is an area chart with stacked areas representing each category, also showing peaks over genomic positions. Colors for categories are consistent across both charts, enhancing comparability. Both charts include tooltips providing additional data on genomic positions, value peaks, and sample names.
