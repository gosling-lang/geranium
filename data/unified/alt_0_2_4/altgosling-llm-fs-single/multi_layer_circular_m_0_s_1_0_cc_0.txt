A circular scatter plot visualizes multivec data on chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The layout is circular with eight sample categories displayed as concentric rows. Each point represents expression levels, stratified by sample categories, and encoded in different colors: blue, orange, green, red, purple, brown, pink, and gray. The y-axis denotes quantitative 'peak' values, with points filtering out the 'sample -' category. The plot provides an intuitive visual of genomic intervals and variant expressions across samples.
