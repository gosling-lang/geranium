The visualization is a linear chart titled "Rule Mark," with the subtitle "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines." It features an overlay alignment composed of three tracks. The primary track is a bar chart showcasing genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, using green-colored bars. The second track overlays horizontal and vertical lines, representing specific genomic positions, with line characteristics adjusted by values in the dataset, notably with sky blue as their color. The third track adds additional vertical lines, uniformly styled with a sky blue color and a stroke width of 2. The chart's domain focuses on small-scale genomic values ranging from 0 to 0.003, with dashed grid lines providing a structured layout. The assembly used is hg38, with a layout that maintains a linear and horizontal orientation, optimized within the specified zoom limits.
