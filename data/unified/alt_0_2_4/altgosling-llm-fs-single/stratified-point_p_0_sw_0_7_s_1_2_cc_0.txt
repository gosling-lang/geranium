The visualization presents a vertical arrangement of scatter plots in a linear layout, depicting genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning 1 to 3,000,500. The chart utilizes a multivec file for data representation. Each of the four rows corresponds to different samples and is indicated by rows of points colored in blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis displays genomic positions, while the y-axis quantifies peak values, and point size varies based on these values. Opacity is set at 0.5 for all points, enhancing visibility of overlapping data. A legend on the right distinguishes the samples, providing clarity in multi-category visualization. Tooltips reveal detailed data including start and end positions, peak values, and sample names.
