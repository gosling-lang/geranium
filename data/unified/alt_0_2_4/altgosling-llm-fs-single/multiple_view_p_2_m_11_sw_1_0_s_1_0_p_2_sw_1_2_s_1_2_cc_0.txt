The visualization features a circular and a linear layout, linked by interactive brushes to update the detailed view. The title is "Visual Linking," with a subtitle guiding users to adjust the brush for detailed views. The top section shows a circular line chart stratified by samples, with colors indicating different samples. Adjacent is an area chart displaying genomic intervals with samples in distinct colors. Both sections link to a detailed linear scatter plot below showing chromosome 1, focusing on positions from 160,000,000 to 200,000,000. Points on the scatter plot are colored by sample category. The charts are constructed using a "multivec" file type, visualizing peaks in genomic data, and organized in a vertical arrangement to facilitate comparison between the circular overview and the linear detail.
