The visualization is a circular bar chart displaying a multivec file spanning chromosome 12 from positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. It features multiple rows, each representing a distinct sample. Within each sample, the expression values are depicted by colored bars along the y-axis. The chart utilizes a range of colors to differentiate between the samples, and opacity levels are adjusted based on expression domains. Data is filtered to exclude specific samples, enhancing clarity. The chart emphasizes genomic intervals on the x-axis, ensuring a clear representation of genomic data.
