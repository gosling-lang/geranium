The visualization is a circular plot depicting genomic data on the hg38 human genome assembly. The outer ring features a circular ideogram color-coded according to distinct chromosome banding patterns, with categories like gneg, gpos25, gpos50, gpos75, gpos100, gvar, and acen represented by a range of colors from blue to pink. Inside, two layers of rectangles illustrate CNV data from a CSV file. The first layer uses green rectangles to show regions with a minor copy number of zero in tumors, while the second layer employs sky blue rectangles to denote regions where the total copy number in tumors is significantly elevated. The innermost layer includes connection lines, signifying genomic rearrangements like tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions, each encoded by different colors. The opacity of the connections is semi-transparent to allow overlapping lines to be distinguished.
