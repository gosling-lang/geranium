A double circular visualization displays genomic data across chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. The left chart features a circular line and scatter plot. Lines and points represent expression values, with position on the x-axis and expression on the y-axis. Categories 'sample 1' through 'sample 4' stratify the data into rows, and colors distinguish each category: blue, orange, green, and red. The right chart is a circular bar plot, using bars to show expression values across the same genomic positions, maintaining the same color scheme for categories. Points vary in size based on expression value.
