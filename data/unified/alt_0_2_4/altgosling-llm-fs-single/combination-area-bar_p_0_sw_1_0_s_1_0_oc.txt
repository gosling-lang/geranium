A vertical layout visualization consists of two stacked tracks displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, within the interval of 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is an area chart, illustrating expression data across four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is represented as a separate row and is colored distinctly, with a white stroke outlining the areas. The y-axis signifies quantitative expression values. The bottom track is a bar chart, similarly displaying expression data for the same four samples. Each bar represents a range of genomic positions, with the y-axis indicating the minimum and maximum expression values observed. Bars are distinguished by color corresponding to each sample, and a black stroke with a width of 0.2 units outlines the bars. Both tracks provide tooltips with details on genomic positions and expression values.
