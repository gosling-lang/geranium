A linear visualization displays genomic data with two tracks, arranged vertically. The top track is a multi-sample bar chart showing regions of chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500, with expression values on the y-axis and samples differentiated by color. The bottom track overlays line and area charts, stratified by sample categories, displaying the same genomic interval. Expression levels are represented by peaks in both area and line forms, with a legend highlighting sample category distinctions. The data source is a multivec file with quantitative peak values.
