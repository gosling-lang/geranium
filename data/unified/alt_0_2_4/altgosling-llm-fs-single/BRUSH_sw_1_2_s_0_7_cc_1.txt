A linear chart visualization contains two tracks, both utilizing multivec data to plot genomic positions against quantitative 'peak' values. The first track, depicted in pink, showcases the entire chromosome 1, with a brush feature in steel blue linking to the second chart. The second track focuses on a specific interval from 200,000,000 to 220,000,000 on chromosome 1. This portion is highlighted and detailed further in green, illustrating 'peak' variations. The visualization, titled "Example: Brushing and Linking," effectively demonstrates interactive data exploration using linked views.
