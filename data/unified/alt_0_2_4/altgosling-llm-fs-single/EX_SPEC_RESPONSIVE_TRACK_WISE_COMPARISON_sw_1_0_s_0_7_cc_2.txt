The visualization contains a vertical arrangement of two genomic range annotation tracks and six bar charts, displaying data on chromosomes 12 and 8. The genomic range tracks include gene annotations with text and visual markers like triangles and rectangles, indicating gene positions and exons. The first range on chromosome 12 is colored in purple, showing gene names like 'FAM52B.' The second range on chromosome 8 is colored sky blue, highlighting 'MYC.'

The bar charts depict expression values across three samples, each displayed on separate tracks. For chromosome 12, Sample 1 and 3 bars are pink, while Sample 2 bars are purple. On chromosome 8, Samples 1 and 2 bars are sky blue, and Sample 3 bars are pink. Data is encoded by genomic position on the x-axis and expression level on the y-axis, with consistent formatting and stroke styling across the charts. These visual elements combine to show differential expression data in a highly layered and comparative manner.
