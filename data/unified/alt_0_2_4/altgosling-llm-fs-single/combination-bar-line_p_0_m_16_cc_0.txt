A series of two scatter plots in a vertical arrangement visualize genomic data on chromosome 1 from base pairs 1 to 3,000,500. The plots use points to represent expression values along the genomic position on the x-axis. Each point is color-coded to signify four samples: sample 1 (blue), sample 2 (orange), sample 3 (green), and sample 4 (red).

The top scatter plot aligns points by genomic position on the x-axis and expression value on the y-axis, emphasizing distribution density. The bottom scatter plot stratifies expression points into separate rows for each sample category, allowing for clearer differentiation by sample. The size of points in both plots is also variable based on the expression value. A legend is included to identify sample categories by color. The interactive tooltip provides detailed information including starting and ending position, expression value, and sample category for each point.
