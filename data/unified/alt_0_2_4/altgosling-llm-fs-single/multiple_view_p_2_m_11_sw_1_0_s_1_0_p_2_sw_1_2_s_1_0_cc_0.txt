A visualization titled "Visual Linking" presents an interactive genomic data exploration across a circular and linear layout. The top view consists of two horizontally aligned sections: a circular line chart and a linear area chart. Both charts display genomic data from chromosome 1, stratified by categories such as 'sample 1' to 'sample 4,' each represented by distinct colorsâ€”blue, orange, green, and red. The circular chart features a line mark, while the linear chart displays data as an area. Both sections include interactive brushes that connect to a detailed scatter plot view below.

The scatter plot in the bottom view focuses on a specific genomic interval (160,000,000 to 200,000,000 on chromosome 1). It shows the data points along the genomic position (x-axis) against quantitative peak values (y-axis), maintaining category-based coloring. This linked multi-view setup allows users to dynamically adjust the selected genomic range, simultaneously updating both the circular/linear charts and scatter plot view for comprehensive analysis. The entire assembly leverages multivec file data with a central theme of visual linking and live data interactions. The subtitle instructs users on using the brushes to interact with the detail view for a more detailed exploration of genome data.
