A circular genomic link chart displays segmental duplications on chromosome 1 between 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. This visualization features interconnected arcs representing genomic regions, with each connection assigned a unique color based on the start position ('s1'). The arcs' transparency is set at 0.2, with a black stroke outline at 0.5 width. The circular layout structure, centered at 0.5 radius, uses a CSV data source, with genomic fields including 's1,' 'e1,' 's2,' and 'e2.' The analysis is static and exhibits a vertical arrangement.
