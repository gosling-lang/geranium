A linear scatter plot shows multivec data for chromosome 1, from position 1 to 3,000,500. In this chart, genomic position is plotted on the x-axis, with expression peaks on the y-axis. Points vary in size and are colored to represent different samples: 'sample 1' in blue, 'sample 2' in orange, 'sample 3' in green, and 'sample 4' in red. An opacity of 0.5 is applied to the points. A grid is present on the y-axis to assist in quantifying peak values. Tooltip functionality is included, revealing start and end positions, peak value, and sample category when hovering over a point. The chart has a configured width and height of 864 and 186 units, respectively.
