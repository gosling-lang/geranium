The visualization consists of two linear tracks displaying genomic data from chromosome 2 using a multivec file format. The top track is a line chart stratified by rows representing different samples: 'sample 1,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4,' each shown in distinct colors. The y-axis represents quantitative peak values, with a white stroke bordering the lines.

The bottom track displays an area chart for 'sample 1' and 'sample 2,' also stratified by sample categories. Colors differentiate the samples, and both tracks share a common genomic x-axis labeled with chromosome 2 position intervals. The white strokes with a width of 0.5 aid in distinguishing between chart elements. The data is linked by a common linking ID, enabling consistent genomic position mapping across the charts.
