The visualization is a circular representation titled "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements." The layout features multiple concentric tracks. The outermost track is a bar chart depicting genomic data with peaks of expression in green bars. Within this, there are two ideogram tracks representing chromosomal bands colored according to categories. Between these ideograms is a connection track showing linkages between genomic positions, visually represented by gray and black lines. This layout in a static, circular form allows for the parallel comparison of genomic features across different chromosomes using multiple data types such as multivec and CSV files. The assembly used is hg38, and various visual encodings (bar color, ideogram color) are implemented to convey genomic information effectively.
