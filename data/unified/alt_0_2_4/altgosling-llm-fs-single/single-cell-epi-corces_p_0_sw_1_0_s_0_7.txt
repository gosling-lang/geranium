A linear visualization titled "Single-cell Epigenomic Analysis" from Corces et al. 2020, displays a multi-track genomic analysis of chromosome 3 (chr3). The analysis includes an ideogram with cytogenetic bands, depicted at the top, where a red interactive brush highlights specific genomic intervals. Below, seven bar charts visualize ATAC-seq data from different cell types: excitatory neurons (orange), inhibitory neurons (green), dopaminergic neurons (purple), microglia (light blue), oligodendrocytes (dark purple), astrocytes (red), and OPCs (pink). These provide quantitative peak data aligned to the right y-axis. A gene annotation track uses blue and red colors to represent positive and negative strand genes, respectively. At the bottom, a PLAC-seq chart visualizes chromatin interactions with purple, blue, and red arcs, representing different tissue sources. This visualization uses hg38 as the genomic assembly and is arranged vertically, with all tracks linked to the interactive ideogram in the overview.
