The visualization is a linear ideogram of chromosome 1 from the hg38 human genome assembly, depicted using a series of colored rectangles. The chart is titled "Basic Marks: Rect" and subtitled "Tutorial Examples." The x-axis shows genomic intervals from the start to the end of chromosome 1. Each rectangle represents a genomic region with colors indicating different stain categories, such as gneg, gpos25, gpos50, gpos75, gpos100, and gvar. These colors range from white to various shades of gray, black, and purple. The chart is styled with a gray outline and a top x-axis.
