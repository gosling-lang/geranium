The visualization is a circular layout depicting a line chart and scatter plot, representing a genomic dataset. It displays data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The chart shows expression values on the y-axis using lines and points, with the size of points indicating the magnitude of expression. The visualization is divided into rows for four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each category is differentiated by distinct colors on the lines and points. The circular chart format allows for a compact, comprehensive view of the genomic data distribution across the specified interval.
