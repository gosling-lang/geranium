The visualization titled "Single-cell Epigenomic Analysis" by Corces et al. 2020 is presented in a vertical arrangement. It consists of 12 distinct charts, starting with a linear ideogram of chromosome 3, outlined in black and gray rectangles, including purple, maroon left triangles, and maroon right triangles, representing various regions.

Below the ideogram, there are seven bar charts, each depicting genomic data for different cell types across chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. These include data for excitatory neurons (pink), inhibitory neurons (green), dopaminergic neurons (gray), microglia (sky blue), oligodendrocytes (purple), astrocytes (dark orange), and OPCs (purple).

Following the bar charts, a genomic range annotation track titled "Genes" shows text labels and rectangles indicating gene locations, with text colors reflecting categories based on strand orientation: blue for positive and red for negative. The PLAC-seq analysis tracks, comprising three charts, follow this, indicated by transparent connections with strokes colored in orange, blue, and purple, representing oligodendrocytes, microglia, and neurons, respectively. These show interaction connections across the genome, displayed in a subtle overlay to the existing track layout.
