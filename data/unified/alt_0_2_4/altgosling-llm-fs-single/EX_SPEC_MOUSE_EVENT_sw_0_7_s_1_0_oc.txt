A set of five charts visualizes genomic data with customized mouse interaction in a linear layout. The charts include "Individual Marks," "Group Marks By Sample," and "Group Marks By Genomic Position," displaying genome positions and expression values using colored bars. Each chart is distinguished by unique color categories representing different sample data. Interactive behavior includes mouse hovering and range selection. Additional tracks, "Group Marks By Gene" and "Group Marks By Chromosome," present genomic annotations with text and graphical elements like rectangles and triangles. These tracks are enhanced by mouse events facilitating data grouping and selection. The layout emphasizes interactivity, allowing users to explore data dynamically, with titles and subtitles providing context. The focus on mouse events aims to enrich data analysis by visually connecting related genomic information.
