A circular and a linear genome visualization organized vertically, with interactive features linking both views. The circular view displays the full genome, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1, highlighted with a blue interactive brush. The circular view consists of an ideogram track, a point annotation track, two range annotation tracks, and a line-connection track. The ideogram is colored based on chromosome bands, the 'Putative Driver' track shows genomic positions with black text, and the 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' tracks represent genomic ranges with blue and red rectangles respectively. The line-connection track visualizes structural variations such as 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' and 'Deletion.' The linear view mirrors these circular tracks with additional features: a gene annotation track showing gene positions and labels, and a 'Point Mutation' scatterplot colored by mutation subtype. The 'Copy Number Variants' track uses gray rectangles to represent quantitative data. Overall, the visualization effectively displays complex genomic information interactively and cohesively.
