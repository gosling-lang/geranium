The visualization consists of three horizontally aligned genomic tracks, each displaying data for chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. 

1. **Bar Chart**: The first track presents a stacked bar chart where the x-axis represents genomic positions and the y-axis depicts expression values. Samples '1', '2', '3', and '4' are distinguished by different colors: blue, orange, green, and red, respectively.

2. **Line and Scatter Plot**: The second track overlays line and scatter plots. The genomic positions are on the x-axis, and the expression values are on the y-axis. Each sample is shown as a separate row with lines and points, using the same color scheme.

3. **Area Chart**: The third track displays an area chart for each sample. Genomic positions are again on the x-axis, with expression values on the y-axis. The data for each sample is stratified into individual rows, using the previously mentioned colors. 

Each chart includes genomic intervals and expression values in tooltips, aiding detailed analysis.
