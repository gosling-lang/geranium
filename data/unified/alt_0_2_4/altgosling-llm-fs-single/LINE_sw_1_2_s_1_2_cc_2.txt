A line chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file across the entire genome of hg38. The x-axis displays genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative expression values derived from the 'peak' field. The lines are colored in purple, with a consistent thickness, providing a clear view of expression variations across genomic regions. The chart's title is 'Basic Marks: line' and it includes the subtitle 'Tutorial Examples.'
