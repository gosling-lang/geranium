The visualization represents a genomic range annotation track titled "IGV" in a linear layout, focusing on chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The chart displays genomic intervals along the x-axis. Rows are stratified by the strand orientation, with '+' and '-' indicating the direction, and encoded in purple. Text annotations on the chart depict gene names, while rectangles represent gene regions. Additional visualization elements include white triangles within gene regions to indicate strand direction. The visualization employs an overlay technique, with tracks aligned vertically. The data is sourced from a BED database file.
