A visualization in a circular layout compares genomic data from chromosome 1 for samples 1 to 4 within an interval of 3,000,500 base pairs. On the left, a circular line and point chart illustrates the 'peak' values of each sample, with the size of points conveying the magnitude of expression. Different colors represent each sample, adding a visual layer of categorization. On the right, a circular bar chart shows bar heights reflecting 'peak' values, with varied colors indicating different samples. The visualization employs a vertical arrangement and static display configuration, emphasizing both line-based and bar-based genomic representation on a unified circular coordinate system.
