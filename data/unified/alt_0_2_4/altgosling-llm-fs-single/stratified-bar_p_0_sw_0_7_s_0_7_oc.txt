The visualization is a linear, vertically arranged bar chart representing genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. It stratifies the data into four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each category is depicted as a separate row, with bars colored distinctively to represent each sample. The x-axis indicates genomic positions, while the y-axis measures the expression levels, shown by the height of the bars. The chart provides a detailed tooltip that reveals the start and end positions, peak value, and sample information for each bar, enhancing interactivity and data comprehension. The overall design centers around an 80% radius, maintaining focus on the genomic intervals represented.
