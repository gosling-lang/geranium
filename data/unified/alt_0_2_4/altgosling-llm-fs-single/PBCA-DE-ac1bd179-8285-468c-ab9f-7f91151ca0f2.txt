This visualization displays a complex genomic data set using a combination of circular and linear views. The circular view at the top features a full genome ideogram with tracks for 'Putative Driver', 'Gain', and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' each represented by bands. These bands are colored in sky blue and dark orange for 'Gain' and 'LOH' respectively. Arcs indicate structural variations, classified into categories like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication,' shown in various colors and strokes.

The linear view below focuses on chromosome 1, linked by a blue interactive brush from the circular view. It includes multiple tracks: an ideogram, 'Putative Driver' with black text annotations, and a scatter plot named 'Point Mutation' showing point mutations colored based on mutation subtypes. Additional tracks include two range tracks displaying insertions (yellow) and deletions (green and gray). The 'Copy Number Variants' track visualizes quantitative data in gray bars. Overall, the visualization employs interactive features like tooltips to aid detailed data exploration.
