A circular area chart arranged vertically displays genomic data for chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The chart visualizes a multivec dataset with four samples, each represented by a colorful area layer. The x-axis shows genomic positions, while the y-axis reflects peak values. Each sample is assigned a distinct color: blue, orange, green, and red. The chart includes nominal categorization by row and displays a legend. The entire visualization uses a circular layout centered with a specific radius in a static configuration.
