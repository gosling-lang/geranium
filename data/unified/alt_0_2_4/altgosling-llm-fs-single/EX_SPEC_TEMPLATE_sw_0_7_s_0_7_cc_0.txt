**Description:**

The visualization titled "Track Template In Gosling.js" demonstrates the use of track templates in Gosling.js for creating complex visualizations. It features a linear layout with three individual tracks, each designed for specific genomic data.

1. **Gene Annotation Track:**
   - Displays genomic data for chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000.
   - Features gray arrow marks indicating gene directions on separate strands.
   - Uses a smooth path style to enhance visual clarity.

2. **Sequence Track:**
   - Focuses on a short segment of chromosome 1 between positions 77,925,299 and 77,925,320.
   - Utilizes colored bars and text to denote sequence data, with color representing different nucleotide bases (A, T, G, C).
   - Text labels are colored according to the nucleotide type and overlay on the bar chart.

3. **Ideogram Track:**
   - Depicts an ideogram for chromosome 1, running across its entirety ((1-248,956,422).
   - Colors indicate different cytogenetic bands, with labels for specific regions (e.g., "q12").
   - Includes black outlines for structural clarity and orientation.

This visualization highlights Gosling.js's capability to dynamically represent detailed genomic annotations and sequence data alongside an ideogram.
