The visualization is a combination of circular and linear genomic charts, showcasing complex genetic data. The circular chart includes an ideogram, annotated with a blue interactive brush linked to the linear view, covering the entire genome. The circular layout features multiple tracks: an ideogram, a point annotation, two range annotations titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and a connection track illustrating genomic structural variations. These variations, such as Translocation, Duplication, and Deletion, are color-coded based on the svclass data field.

The linear chart aligns with chromosome 1 of the circular view and contains similar tracks augmented with additional data types. It features a gene annotation track, a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation," and two additional range annotation tracks for Insertion and Deletion. Each track in the linear view uses varied data inputs, including CSV and VCF files, displaying information with distinct visual encodings like points, rectangles, and text. The entire visualization is enhanced with detailed tooltips and mouse interactions, facilitating intricate data exploration and interpretation.
