The visualization presents genomic data in a vertical arrangement, featuring three linear views of chromosome 13. Each view is aligned to show detailed genomic annotations and variant significance information, focusing on different intervals:

1. **Genomic Range Tracks:** Each view includes a track titled "HiGlass," displaying gene annotations using arrows and text. The genes are displayed with arrows indicating transcription direction and are colored based on strand: blue for positive and red for negative.

2. **Variant Significance Tracks:** Below the gene annotations, bars and points represent the clinical significance of variants from the ClinVar database. Categories range from "Pathogenic" to "Benign," represented with a color scale from shades of magenta to green.

3. **Details:**
   - The first view covers the genomic region from 31,500,000 to 33,150,000, highlighting genes like EEF1DP3, BRCA2, and PDS5B.
   - The second view narrows to the interval 32,000,000 to 32,700,000, emphasizing additional variant density and significance.
   - The final view further focuses on 32,314,000 to 32,402,500, offering greater detail on a smaller scale.

4. **Styling:** The tracks use opacity and size adjustments for clarity, adapting visibility based on zoom level to manage dense data efficiently.

This design allows for comprehensive exploration of genetic regions, integrating gene structure and variant impact visually across specified intervals of
