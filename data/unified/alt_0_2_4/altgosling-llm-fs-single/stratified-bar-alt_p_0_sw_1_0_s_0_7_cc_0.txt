The visualization is a multi-row bar chart in a linear layout that presents a multivec file, illustrating regions on chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The chart features four rows, one for each sample ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'), with colors blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. Each bar's height represents the range of values for 'peak_min' to 'peak_max' for each sample. The visualization includes genomic intervals along the x-axis and quantitative expression values on the y-axis. It also includes categorical legends for each sample, enhancing interpretability by color-coding the bars per sample category.
