The visualization consists of three horizontal bar charts aligned side by side, each representing genomic data from different chromosomes and intervals. Specifically, the left and right charts depict data from chromosome 12, spanning positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000, while the middle chart focuses on chromosome 9, across the same interval range. Each chart highlights the 'peak' value of genomic positions using Quantitative (y-axis) data, drawn from a multivec file. The color scheme distinguishes the charts: the left uses sky blue, the middle features green, and the right is in pink. All bars are bordered in white to enhance definition. The charts dynamically respond to width changes, maintaining a fixed height, and rearrange vertically if the display width falls below a specified threshold, ensuring optimal viewing flexibility.
