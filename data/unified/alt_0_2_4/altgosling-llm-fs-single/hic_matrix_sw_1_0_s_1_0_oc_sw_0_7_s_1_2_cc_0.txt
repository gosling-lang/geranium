A heat map in a linear layout visualizes a genomic matrix file, covering a genomic interval from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000. The x-axis displays genomic intervals, while the y-axis represents another set of genomic intervals. The color intensity reflects quantitative values, using a 'hot' color scheme to indicate expression levels. The visualization is 630x630 pixels in dimension, based on assembly hg38.
