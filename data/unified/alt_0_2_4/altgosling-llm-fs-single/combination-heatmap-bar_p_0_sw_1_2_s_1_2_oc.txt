A linear visualization consisting of two vertically arranged tracks displays genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a heatmap, showing expression levels across four samples ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'), with intensity encoded by color from a multivec dataset. The layout stratifies data by sample, enhancing categorical clarity. Below, the second track presents a bar chart visualizing the same samples, with genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Each sample is distinctly colored, facilitating visual comparison. Both tracks include interactive tooltips displaying genomic positions and peak values, providing an informative, dynamic exploration of the data. The assembly used is hg38.
