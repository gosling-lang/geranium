The visualization is a linear layout focused on chromosome 1, spanning positions 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. It consists of seven tracks, showing genomic intervals as green rectangles and connections between intervals. The rectangles are defined by two sets of genomic fields, 's1' to 'e1' and 's2' to 'e2', with the regions linked by connections displayed as transparent green. The data uses a CSV source and displays detailed genomic position tooltips on hover. The chart's styling features green strokes with a width of 0.8 for both rectangles and links, enhancing the structural patterns shown across these intervals.
