A linear genome visualization of chromosome 1, spanning from 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs, features two tracks. The top track is a multi-row bar chart with quantitative values displayed on the y-axis. It represents four samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4'), differentiated by blue, orange, green, and red colors, respectively. The bottom track is a heat map, showcasing expression values through color intensity. It is organized by sample rows, with genomic intervals on the x-axis. Both tracks include interactive tooltips detailing genomic positions and quantitative values, providing detailed insights into the dataset.
