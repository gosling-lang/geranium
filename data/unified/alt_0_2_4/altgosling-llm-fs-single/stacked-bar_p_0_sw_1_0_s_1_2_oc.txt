The visualization is a stacked bar chart in a linear layout, depicting multivec data for chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis quantifies peak values from four samples. Each bar's color corresponds to a different sample category, with sample 1 in yellow, sample 2 in green, sample 3 in blue, and sample 4 in pink. Tooltips display genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample names. The chart is interactive, with legends clarifying sample identities and grid lines assisting in value estimation.
