A linear bar chart visualizes a multivec file, representing genomic data across various chromosomes. Each bar indicates expression values on the y-axis, with the genomic positions distributed along the x-axis. The bars are uniformly colored in purple, and the chart is titled "Basic Marks: bar" with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples." The visualization spans the entire genome of hg38 and aggregates data into bins of size 5.
