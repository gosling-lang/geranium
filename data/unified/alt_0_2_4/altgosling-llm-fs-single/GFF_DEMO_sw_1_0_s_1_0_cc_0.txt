A linear visualization of the E. coli genome displays a segment from 222,000 to 240,000 base pairs on chromosome U00096.3. Gene annotations from a GFF3 file are represented using triangles, text, and lines. The orientation of genes is indicated by right and left triangles, with colors denoting different gene biotypes such as protein-coding, tRNA, and rRNA. Text labels display gene names, and colored lines connect gene start and end points. The description is titled "GFF3 file" with the subtitle "E. coli genome, colored by gene type."
