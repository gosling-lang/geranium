The visualization is a linear line chart that displays genomic data from the entire hg38 genome assembly. It uses data from a multivec file with the 'peak' value field. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis shows quantitative values of 'peak' expression. The line is styled with a constant width of 2 units and is colored pink. The visualization is titled "Basic Marks: line" and has a subtitle "Tutorial Examples," highlighting its function as an illustrative example. The layout is non-static, allowing for interactive adjustments, such as zooming and panning.
