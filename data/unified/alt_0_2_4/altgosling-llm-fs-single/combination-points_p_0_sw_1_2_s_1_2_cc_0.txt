A linear layout visualization displays multivec data across chromosome 1 ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. It includes two vertically arranged scatter plots. The top track represents data as stratified points across four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', using colors like blue, orange, green, and red. Each point's position on the y-axis and its size encode the 'peak' value, with the x-axis representing genomic positions. The bottom scatter plot highlights overlapping data points with gridlines for clarity, maintaining similar categorical and color encoding. The plots provide tooltip information on genomic start and end positions, peaks, and sample names.
