The visualization is a linear multi-row scatter plot representing genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500, using the hg38 assembly. It displays expression values for samples 1 to 4 along the y-axis, with the x-axis showing genomic positions. Each row corresponds to a different sample, colored in blue, orange, green, and red. The size of points is proportional to the expression peak value, and there is a tooltip detailing start and end positions, peak values, and sample identities. The opacity of points is set to 0.5, allowing for visual comparison across samples. The chart includes a legend indicating the color coding of samples.
