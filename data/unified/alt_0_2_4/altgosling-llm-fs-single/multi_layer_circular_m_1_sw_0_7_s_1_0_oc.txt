A circular line chart visualizing a multivec file shows chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. Each line represents data samples stratified across multiple rows. The expression values are plotted on the y-axis, grouped by domains: 0-0.01, 0-0.0025, 0.0025-0.005, 0.005-0.0075, and 0.0075-0.01. Line transparency varies among groupings with opacity adjustments (1, 0.33). Different colors denote each sample, with fourteen categories visible. The visualization references Javed et al.'s study on graphical perception of multiple time series.
