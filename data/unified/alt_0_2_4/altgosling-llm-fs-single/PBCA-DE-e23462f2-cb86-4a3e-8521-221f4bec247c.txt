The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view aligned vertically. The circular view showcases the entire genome with tracks for ideogram, gene annotations, and structural variations. The ideogram is colored to indicate different genomic categories, with an interactive brush to connect to the detailed linear view. The chart titled 'Gain' features blue rectangles indicating genomic regions of interest, while the 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' track displays orange rectangles. The line-connection track illustrates structural variations like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication,' with lines colored based on their category. In the linear view, the chart titled 'Point Mutation' represents mutation distances with points color-coded by subtype, using VCF data. Additional tracks include annotations for insertions and deletions, copy number variants shown in gray rectangles based on the 'total_cn' field, and tracks titled 'Gain' and 'LOH' visualizing CNV data. This holistic view links high-level genomic data with detailed chromosome 1 insights, enhancing genetic analysis and research comprehensibility.
