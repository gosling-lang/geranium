A bubble chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, depicting the entire genome of hg38 across chromosomes. The chart uses a point mark to display data, with both the position and size encoded using the 'peak' field. The title is 'Basic Marks: point,' and the subtitle is 'Tutorial Examples.' The width of the visualization is 1152 pixels, and the height is 246 pixels. The x-axis represents genomic position, while the y-axis indicates quantitative values of 'peak.' The layout is horizontal, and the chart is not static, allowing zooming interactions. The data is retrieved from an online source in multivec format, categorized under 'sample 1.'
