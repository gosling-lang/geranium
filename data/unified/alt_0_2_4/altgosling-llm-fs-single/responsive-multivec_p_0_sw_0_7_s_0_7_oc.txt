A multi-row bar chart visualizes genomic data from a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 12 intervals from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The chart is in a linear layout, with rows representing different samples and colors indicating categories like 'sample 1' to 'sample 16.' The y-axis, which is not labeled, shows quantitative values of 'peak.' Multiple visibility thresholds adjust the vertical domain range between 0 to 0.01 based on height changes. The chart is part of a responsive design described in a study by Javed et al., related to graphical perception of multiple time series.
