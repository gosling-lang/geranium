A visualization titled "Gremlin (O'Brien et al. 2010)" illustrates chromosome 5 using a linear layout. The main chart presents a cyto-band ideogram with rectangular marks showing genomic bands, colored according to data categories. A linked brush highlights regions for more granular focus. Below, a track shows connections between chromosome 5 and others, presented in green lines or within-link arcs. The colors indicate different chromosomes: blue for chromosome 5, orange for chromosome 4, and green for chromosome 6. A secondary view labeled "Region of Interest" zooms into coordinates between 68,000,000 and 71,000,000, featuring connections in blue and green arcs corresponding to duplications and segment demarcations. The "Rearrangement View" provides a detailed look at chromosome arrangements between coordinates 69,276,000 and 69,282,000, displayed in broad blue arcs. The visualization leverages data from CSV files encoded in a genomic format, emphasizing structural variations and detailed genomic explorations.
