A vertical arrangement of linear tracks visualizes BED files on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 2,000,000. The visualization demonstrates four configurations: 

1. "BED12: All 12 standard fields" in purple.
2. "BED6: A file with the first 6 BED fields" in sky blue.
3. "BED6+6: A file with the first 6 BED fields and 6 custom fields" in green.
4. "BED12+1: A file with all 12 standard fields and an extra custom field" in green.

Each track displays genomic intervals as rectangles, showcasing different BED file specifications.
