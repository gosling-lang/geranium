The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view arranged vertically. The circular view features a 23-segment ideogram representing human chromosomes, with tracks for genomic data such as putative drivers and structural variations. The tracks include textual annotations and rectangular bars in colors like light gray, sky blue, and dark orange, indicating categories like 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH).' Interactive links between the circular and linear views are enabled by a brush tool.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, presenting various annotations. An ideogram is followed by labeled tracks for putative drivers, point mutations, and indels. The point mutation scatter plot is encoded with colors representing mutation subtypes (e.g., C>A, T>G). Indels are displayed with colored rectangles for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion.' A track for 'Copy Number Variants' uses bars to show variant data, with a gray color scheme. Connections and vertical lines between tracks visually denote structural variations, with colors indicating types like translocations and duplications.
