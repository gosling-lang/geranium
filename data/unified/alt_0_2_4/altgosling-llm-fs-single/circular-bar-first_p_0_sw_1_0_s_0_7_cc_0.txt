A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The height of the bars encodes data from the 'peak' field, with four categories ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4') represented by different colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The chart features a quantitative y-axis with grid lines and a legend indicating the categories. The static circular layout has a center radius of 0.5, and the chart is oriented horizontally.
