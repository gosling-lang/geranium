A genomic heatmap visualization in linear layout represents a matrix data file. The display focuses on a genomic interval between 800,000,000 and 1,800,000,000. Both the x-axis and y-axis are genomic, showing the same interval. Color intensity in the heatmap encodes quantitative expression values using a grey color range. The assembly used is hg38, and the visualization does not include any static or interactive elements beyond the basic representation of data ranges.
