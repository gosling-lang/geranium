The visualization consists of two vertically arranged linear tracks showcasing genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a scatter plot where each point represents a genomic position with its expression value, size, and color indicating the 'peak' and 'sample' categories, respectively. The lower track displays an area chart stratified by 'sample,' with different colors representing distinct categories. Both tracks use a multivec file type, providing quantitative insights into the genomic dataset, with interactive tooltips to enhance data exploration. The layout is highly informative, loading efficiently with dynamic visual encoding for detailed analysis.
