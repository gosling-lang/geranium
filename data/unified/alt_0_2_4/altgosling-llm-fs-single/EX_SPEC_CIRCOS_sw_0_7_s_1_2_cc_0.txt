This Circos plot visualization showcases genomic data in a circular layout. It includes three primary tracks. The first track is a circular bar chart visualizing positional data with pink bars, representing a quantitative measure named "peak." The second track is a circular ideogram, displaying genomic intervals with colorful rectangles indicating different categories, based on a field named "Stain." The third track is a complex circular chart with connection links, demonstrating genomic relationships. These links are colored differently depending on categorical data from a field "chr_2", providing insights into segment duplications and other genomic interactions. Each track is part of a stacked alignment, emphasizing the comprehensive nature of genomic data distribution across chromosomes in this interactive circular format.
