The visualization presents a linear arrangement with three vertical tracks to display multivec data for chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The first track combines line and scatter plots to depict the 'peak' values for four samples, using lines and varying size points colored uniquely for each sample. The second track displays an area chart with the same genomic and quantitative fields, distinguished by color for each sample. The third track is a bar chart illustrating 'peak' values by sample, using stacked bars with distinct colors for each sample. The charts provide comprehensive comparative insights across samples, with tooltip interactivity for precise data interpretation.
