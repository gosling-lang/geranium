The visualization is a linear layout titled "Basic Marks: Text," with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples." This chart uses a multivec file to represent genomic data across the full extent of hg38. It plots nucleotide bases "A," "T," "G," and "C" along the x-axis, labeled with chromosome numbers. The y-axis quantitatively displays their respective "count" values. Each letter is color-coded according to its base category: adenine in yellow, thymine in green, guanine in blue, and cytosine in pink. The text elements, visible as large letters, are styled with no stroke weight, ensuring clarity and emphasis on the base data.
