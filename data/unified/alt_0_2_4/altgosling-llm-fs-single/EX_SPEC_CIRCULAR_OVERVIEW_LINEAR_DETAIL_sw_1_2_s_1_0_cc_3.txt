A circular visualization displays genomic data using a multivec file across multiple chromosomes, showcasing 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4' in different colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The outer track is a circular bar chart showing 'peak' values across genomic intervals. The inner track is a connection chart illustrating structural rearrangements between chromosomes, with green lines indicating linkages. Below, two linear bar charts detail specific regions on chromosomes 5 and 16, each colored by sample categories and linked interactively through brushing in the circular chart.
