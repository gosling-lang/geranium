The visualization titled "Visual Linking" features a circular and linear arrangement of genomic data from chromosome 1. The top section shows a circular bar chart and a horizontal bar chart, both displaying genomic intervals with stratified rows for categories 'sample 1' through 'sample 4'. The rows are color-coded using distinct hues like blue, orange, green, and red. Each bar chart includes a brush for linking views, allowing interactive adjustments to update the detailed view in the lower section. The detailed linear view at the bottom focuses on a specific genomic range from 160,000,000 to 200,000,000 base pairs, providing a more granular look at the peaks represented as bars. This setup allows users to explore and correlate large-scale genomic data across different visual formats.
