A visualization with linear layout tracks using a multivec file displays data from chromosome 2. The first track is a line chart that stratifies rows by samples, with expression values along the y-axis and genomic positions along the x-axis. The categories, sample 1, sample 3, and sample 4, are represented by different line colors: blue, orange, and green. The second track is an area chart with samples 1 and 2 displayed, similarly stratified by rows and using corresponding colors. Both tracks share a linking ID for interconnected navigation.
