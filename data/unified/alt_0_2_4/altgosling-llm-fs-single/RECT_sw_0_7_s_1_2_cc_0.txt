The visualization is a linear ideogram titled "Basic Marks: Rect" with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples." It displays chromosome 1 from the genome assembly hg38. The x-axis represents genomic positions, segmented into colored rectangles. Each rectangle is colored based on the "Stain" field, indicating different categories. The categories are represented by various colors, such as blue, orange, green, and red. The visualization uses data from a CSV file, with the genomic intervals defined by "chromStart" and "chromEnd." The stroke around each rectangle is gray, providing a contrast to the colored fills.
