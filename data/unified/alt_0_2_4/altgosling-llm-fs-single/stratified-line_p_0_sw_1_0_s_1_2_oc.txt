A line and scatter plot in a linear layout represents a multivec file visualizing genomic data for chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. It features four distinct rows, categorized by 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4.' Each row is colored differently with a legend. The x-axis shows the genomic positions, while the y-axis displays quantitative expression values, represented by line marks with point overlays. The size of the points correlates with expression values, adding another dimension to the visualization.
