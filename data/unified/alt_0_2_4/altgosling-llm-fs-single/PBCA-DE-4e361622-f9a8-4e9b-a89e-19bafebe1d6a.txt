The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view, arranged one above the other, connected by an interactive blue brush in the circular view. The circular view, representing the entire genome, incorporates a circular ideogram, point annotation track, two range annotation tracks, and a line-connection track. A specific emphasis is on tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)', which display genomic ranges in sky blue and dark orange, respectively. A variety of structural variations such as 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion' are connected using lines of various colors. In the linear view, details of chromosome 1 are visualized with similar tracks alongside additional features: a gene annotation track, a scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation', and range annotation tracks for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion', represented by yellow and green rectangles. The 'Copy Number Variants' track provides visualizations through gray bars, detailing a quantitative analysis based on the field 'total_cn'.
