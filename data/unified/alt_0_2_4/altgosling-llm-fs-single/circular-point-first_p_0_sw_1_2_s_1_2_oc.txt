A circular scatter plot displays genomic data from chromosome 1, covering a range from 1 to 3,000,500. The plot is divided into four concentric tracks, each representing a different sample: 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' The points indicate expression values on the y-axis and their sizes are also reflective of these values. Each sample is uniquely colored, with a shared legend for easy identification. The arrangement is vertical, and the layout is static, maintaining a consistent zoom level. The opacity of the points is set at 0.5, adding a degree of transparency. The interactive tooltip provides additional genomic and quantitative information per point.
