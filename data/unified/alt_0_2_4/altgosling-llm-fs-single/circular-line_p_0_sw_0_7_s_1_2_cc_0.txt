A circular chart in a vertical arrangement visualizes a multivec file for chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. This chart incorporates both lines and points to represent data across four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The data is displayed in a layered manner with each sample represented by a distinct colorâ€”blue, orange, green, and red. Lines indicate changes across the genomic interval, while the size of points reflects quantitative values from the 'peak' field. The circular layout with a center radius of 0.5 provides an interactive view with tooltips for position, value, and sample information. The legend is visible, elucidating the color-coding for each sample.
