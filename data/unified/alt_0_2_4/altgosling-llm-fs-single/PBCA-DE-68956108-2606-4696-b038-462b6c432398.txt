The visualization comprises a circular and linear layout, depicting genetic data from the hg19 assembly. The circular layout features five tracks, including an ideogram, a text annotation track for "Putative Driver," and tracks showing data on genetic "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" with sky blue and dark orange rectangles, respectively. A connection track represents structural variations in colors based on categories such as 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.'

The linear layout, focused on chromosome 1, mirrors the circular layout with additional elements. It includes a gene annotation track displaying gene and exon positions, a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" with colored points indicating mutation subtypes, and range annotation tracks for insertions, deletions, and copy number variants, adding further detail. The interactive brush in the circular view links to the linear view, providing a dynamic exploration of genomic intervals.
