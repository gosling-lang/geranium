The visualization consists of two line charts arranged vertically, showcasing genomic data from chromosome 1. The title is "Example: Brushing and Linking". The top chart displays a wide view of the chromosome, with the x-axis showing genomic positions and the y-axis displaying quantitative values (peak) represented as green lines. An interactive steel blue brush is present on the x-axis, linking to the bottom chart.

The bottom chart focuses on a specific interval of chromosome 1, between 200,000,000 and 220,000,000, as defined by the top chart's brush. This chart also features green lines to depict quantitative values, set against a low-opacity steel blue background to highlight the selected region. Both charts utilize the same multivec dataset, providing a linked exploration of the genomic data across different resolutions.
