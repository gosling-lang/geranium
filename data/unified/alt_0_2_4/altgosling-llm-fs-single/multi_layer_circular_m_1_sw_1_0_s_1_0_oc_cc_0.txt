A circular line chart visualizes multiple genomic samples along chromosome 12, spanning positions from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The chart employs a multivec data structure and features various samples, excluding those labeled as "sample -." Each line represents a sample, and colors differentiate the samples. The y-axis shows expression values, segmented into five ranges with varying opacities. The outer circle presents a comprehensive view, integrated within a circular layout with spacing and radial lines for clarity. The visualization is based on a study by Javed et al. on graphical perception of multiple time series.
