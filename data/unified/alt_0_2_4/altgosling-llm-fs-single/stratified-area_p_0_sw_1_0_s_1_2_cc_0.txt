The visualization is a multi-sample area plot arranged in a vertical layout, representing genomic data on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The data is sourced from a multivec file and categorized into four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each displayed as a separate row. The x-axis denotes genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative data fields named 'peak'. Each sample is color-coded uniquely: 'sample 1' in blue, 'sample 2' in orange, 'sample 3' in green, and 'sample 4' in red. The chart includes interactive tooltips displaying start and end genomic positions, peak values, and sample names. The data is visually encoded using white strokes with a width of 0.5 for clarity.
