A linear genomic visualization displays chromosome 3 from 52,168,000 to 52,890,000 using six individual vertical views. These views include tracks titled 'Corces et al.', 'IGV', 'HiGlass', 'GmGDV', 'Cyverse-QUBES', and another range annotation track without a title. Each track employs various visual encodings: text, rectangles, rules, and triangles. The data, fetched from a BEDDB source, is color-coded by strand direction; blue for the positive strand and red for the negative. Categories are stratified in rows to distinguish different genetic elements like genes and exons. Specifically, 'GmGDV' and 'Cyverse-QUBES' use triangle shapes to indicate gene direction, while 'IGV' employs navy-colored marks. Additionally, introns, exons, and genes are marked with gray, light gray, and purple, respectively. This visualization encompasses a horizontal arrangement of diverse genomic annotations, aiding in comparative genomic studies across different platforms.
