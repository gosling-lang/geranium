The visualization is a linear scatter plot representing point mutations from a VCF file. The genomic positions are displayed along the x-axis, covering multiple chromosomes. Points on the y-axis denote the expression values, with colors reflecting different mutation subtypes, including C>A, C>G, C>T, T>A, T>C, and T>G. The opacity of points is set at 0.9, ensuring visibility against the backdrop. The subtitle of the chart is "Point mutations from a VCF file," enhancing interpretive clarity. The overall layout is vertical, with a legend on the right indicating the color scheme for mutation subtypes.
