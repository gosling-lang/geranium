The visualization comprises four genomic range annotation tracks laid out in a horizontal linear format, representing a region on chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. Each track corresponds to a different data view, titled 'Corces et al.,' 'GmGDV,' 'IGV,' and another unnamed track, all structured in vertical arrangement within two separate columns.

1. **Corces et al.**: Displays genes using text and rectangles with colors representing the strand orientation (blue for '+', orange for '-'). Rectangles also depict exons with thicker bars and genes as lines connecting start and end positions.

2. **IGV**: This view uses green for both textual annotations and rectangular representations of gene positions. Lines with white triangles indicate gene directionality based on strand orientation.

3. **GmGDV**: Features orange and blue arrows indicating strands and direction. This view includes triangle representations of gene direction and rectangles for exons.

4. **Unnamed View**: Utilizes shades of sky blue and purple, representing exonic and intronic regions respectively. The stroke of rectangles indicates strand division, with text labels for gene names.

Each track maintains alignment to the genomic axis with chromosome intervals marked at the top. The tracks are stratified by rows for strands, indicated by color. The visualization adopts a consistent color palette across views for intuitive navigation, with strand-specific colors and standard genomic representation techniques like rule markings for genes.
