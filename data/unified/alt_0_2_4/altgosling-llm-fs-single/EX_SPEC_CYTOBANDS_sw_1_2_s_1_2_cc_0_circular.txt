A spiral layout visualization features five concentric circular arrangements representing chromosomes 1 through 5. Each circle consists of two layers: a multivec area track and a cytogenetic band ideogram. The area tracks visualize genomic positions on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis for four samples in distinct colors. The ideograms display genomic intervals with bands colored based on density, alongside interspersed triangle markers for acen regions, colored maroon. The color-coded density categories range from white to black, while gvar regions are marked in purple. The design maintains a static arrangement with fixed zoom limits, emphasizing parallel genomic data interpretation across chromosomes.
