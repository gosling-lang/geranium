The visualization comprises two sections: a circular view showing the entire genome and a linear view focused on chromosome 1. The circular view contains multiple tracks, including a detailed ideogram, a point annotation track titled 'Putative Driver', and two range annotation tracks named 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH).' These tracks represent genomic alterations using color-coded rectangles in blue and orange, respectively. A line-connection track highlights structural variations such as 'Translocation' and 'Duplication,' with variations indicated by different colors.

In the linear section, tracks mirror those in the circular view but provide more detailed annotation, including additional tracks for gene annotations, point mutations, and copy number variants. The point mutation track, titled 'Point Mutation,' illustrates mutation distances with a scatterplot, colored by mutation subtype. The copy number variant track shows quantitative data using bars in gray. The visualization is interactive, linked by a blue brush from the circular to the linear view, allowing exploration of genomic data across the entire genome and specific chromosomes.
