A Hi-C matrix chart in a linear layout visualizes genomic interactions within the specified interval [800,000,000, 1,800,000,000] on the x-axis. The visualization includes overlaid elements that provide an enriched representation. The matrix plot shows genomic positions on both x and y axes, with color intensity representing interaction frequencies. Sky blue lines annotate specific genomic locations across the axes. Vertical and horizontal lines created with JSON annotations add another layer of information. Within the matrix, additional bar and point plots provide quantitative and categorical information respectively, with points displayed in pink. The chart uses the hot color scheme for expression values, and light gray for background, enhancing data readability. The title is "Hi-C Matrix" and the subtitle is "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations."
