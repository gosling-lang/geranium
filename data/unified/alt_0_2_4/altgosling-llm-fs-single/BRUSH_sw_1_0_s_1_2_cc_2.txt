The visualization consists of two linear line charts titled "Example: Brushing and Linking." Designed for the hg38 assembly, each chart shows genomic data from chromosome 1 using multivec data. The top chart displays a purple line plot over the entire chromosome, with a blue interactive brush linking to the lower chart. The lower track focuses on a specific interval (200,000,000 to 220,000,000) of chromosome 1, shown in a pink line, with a semi-transparent steel blue background for emphasis. The brushing mechanism enables interactive linking between views, facilitating detailed exploration of genomic regions.
