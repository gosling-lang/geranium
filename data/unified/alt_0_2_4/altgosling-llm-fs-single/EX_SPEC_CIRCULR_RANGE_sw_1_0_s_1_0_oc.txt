A circular bar chart visualization displays genomic data in a radial layout, illustrating a vector dataset. The horizontal axis represents genomic positions across all chromosomes, while the vertical axis encodes quantitative peak values. Bars, colored in a light yellow (#EEEDA1), radiate outward from the center, aligning with their genomic positions to demonstrate variations in expression levels. This chart employs a static, evenly spaced format and spans a radius within a defined circular area, offering an intuitive overview of genomic patterns across the entire genome.
