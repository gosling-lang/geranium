The given JSON specification defines a linear visualization with multiple tracks for analyzing genomic data. It features a multivec dataset representing chromosome 1 ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. The main view consists of vertically arranged tracks aligned in an overlay manner, showcasing data from four different samples. Each sample is represented by a distinct color—blue, orange, green, and red—and displayed in separate rows with lines and points as marks. The line chart depicts the genomic position on the x-axis and the peak value on the y-axis. The scatter plot elements vary in size based on the quantitative peak values. Tooltips provide insights into the position, value, and sample upon interaction. This visualization aids in comparing quantitative genomic data across samples, providing clear insights into the peaks and distributions within the specified genomic interval.
