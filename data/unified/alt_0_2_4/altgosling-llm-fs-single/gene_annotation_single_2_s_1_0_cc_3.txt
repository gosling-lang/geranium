The visualization is a linear genomic annotation track titled "IGV" displaying gene annotations on chromosome 3 between the positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The track has two rows, one for each DNA strand, aligned vertically. Gene names are shown as text labels, and genomic ranges are represented by green rectangles. Forward and reverse gene directions are indicated by white triangle patterns on the respective strands. The track's layout is horizontal, with green color used for both text and rectangles, and white for directional indicators.
