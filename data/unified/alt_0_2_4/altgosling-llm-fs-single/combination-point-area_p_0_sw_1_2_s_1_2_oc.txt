The visualization comprises two tracks in a linear layout. The top track is a scatter plot displaying genomic data across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. Points on the plot represent expression values, with their size and position on the y-axis determined by a quantitative field named "peak." Points are colored by categories labeled as "sample 1" through "sample 4," with varying colors for each. The bottom track features an area chart stratified by the same categorical "sample" field, and color-coded similarly. It shows expression values on the y-axis with areas filled under each category's trend line. Both tracks provide tooltip information for genomic start and end positions, sample, and peak value.
