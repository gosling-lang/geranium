The circular area chart visualizes genomic data for chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500. It displays expression values along the y-axis with areas stratified across four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is represented by distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis represents the genomic positions. The chart is static with a center radius of 0.5, and provides tooltips that show start and end positions, values, and sample names. The assembly used is hg38.
