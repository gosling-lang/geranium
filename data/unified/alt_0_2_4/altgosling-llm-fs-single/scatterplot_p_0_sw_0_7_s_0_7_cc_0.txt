The visualization is a scatter plot in a linear layout, displaying chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 using the hg38 assembly. It uses a multivec file where genomic positions are mapped on the x-axis and expression values are plotted on the y-axis and represented by the size of points. The color of each point signifies different samples, specifically 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', with colors including blue, orange, green, and red. The opacity of points is set to 0.5, enhancing visual clarity, and a tooltip provides information on genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample names.
