This visualization is a linear chart titled "Basic Marks: Link," shown as tutorial examples. It utilizes genomic data from chromosome 1 using a CSV file. The visualization displays arcs representing connections between genomic intervals on the x-axis, with domains specifying positions on chromosome 1. The arcs are drawn in a light red color (#fc8585), visually encoding start and end positions (s1, e1, s2, e2) of linked regions. The layout is horizontal, measuring 960 by 246 pixels, facilitating a detailed exploration of genomic linkages across different segments within the specified chromosome.
