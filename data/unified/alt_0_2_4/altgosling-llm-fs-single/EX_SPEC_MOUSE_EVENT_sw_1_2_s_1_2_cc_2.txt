A series of five visual elements arranged vertically showcases customized mouse events applied to bar charts and genomic tracks. Each view highlights specific data categorizations through color variations and outlines.

1. **Bar Chart: 'Individual Marks’** - Displays genomic intervals on the x-axis with expression depicted by bars on the y-axis. Colors represent distinct categories, offering interactive mouse-hover effects altering color to blue and opacity to 0.5.

2. **Bar Chart: 'Group Marks By Sample’** - Similar genomic depiction with color-coded categories representing different samples. Customized interactions include hover and range selection with a brush color of green.

3. **Bar Chart: 'Group Marks By Genomic Position’** - Genomic positions create the base, sorting expressions in colorful bars. Interactive elements allow grouping by position with hover effects, alongside a yellow range selection brush.

4. **Genomic Range Annotation: 'Group Marks By Gene’** - Represents genomic data in distinct annotations, with exons marked by triangles. Colors adjust based on gene information, with behind-visual effects enhancing hover and selection interactivity.

5. **Ideogram & Composite Chart: 'Group Marks By Chromosome’** - Depicts chromosomes with associated bands, showcasing density through a grayscale range and distinct shapes for special markers. The brush and selection responses include red hues for interaction feedback.

Interactive capabilities throughout these elements focus on enhancing user engagement and insight into genomic data distributions, spanning distinct categorical fields like samples, positions, and genes.
