The circular area chart visualizes a multivec file centered on chromosome 12, spanning from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. It features multiple rings, representing different samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 6', 'sample 7', 'sample 8', each with unique colors. The height of the area indicates the quantitative field 'peak', and the genome's position is displayed on the circular x-axis. Data filtering excludes 'sample -', ensuring clarity in representation. The chart is in a circular layout with a focus on demonstrating expression levels via area size and color differentiation across samples.
