This visualization, titled "Hi-C Matrix," showcases Hi-C data using a matrix with overlaid annotations. It displays genomic interactions across a specified genomic range (800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000). The matrix uses color intensity from the 'hot' range to represent quantitative expression values, with axes labeled genomically. Annotations include vertical and horizontal rules, colored green and sky blue respectively, marking specific genomic positions (e.g., chr2, chr5, chr10). Additionally, a bar layer and a point layer provide further detail: the bar layer encodes categories by stroke, while the point layer sizes points based on a quantitative value (v) and colors them green. The overall layout is linear, with a light gray background and visible dashed lines for emphasis. These tracks and annotations make the visual analysis dynamic and detailed, aiding in the interpretation of complex genomic interactions.
