The linear layout visualizes chromosome 1 between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000 of hg38. It features interconnected tracks, each displaying genomic ranges represented by rectangles and connections. The ranges in the tracks are colored in purple, blue, and green, indicating different data values. Rectangles define genomic intervals, while connections link corresponding positions, revealing genomic relationships. The visualization employs transparency and outlines to enhance visibility and data comparison, offering a detailed view at a resolution suitable for assessing segmental duplications or similar genomic events.
