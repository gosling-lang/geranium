The visualization presents two linear and vertically arranged charts displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from 1 to 3,000,500. The top track features an area chart divided into four rows representing 'sample 1' to 'sample 4', each shown in distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. Genomic positions are mapped on the x-axis, while 'peak' values are on the y-axis. This track uses area marks to represent quantitative values associated with each sample, also incorporating tooltips for detail.

The bottom track is a scatter plot with points sized and colored based on 'peak' values and sample categories, respectively. The x-axis denotes genomic positions while the y-axis displays 'peak' values with grid lines for reference. Opacity is set to 0.5, enhancing visual exploration. This layout facilitates comparative analysis across samples using a multivec data format, efficiently encoding gene expression data for deep insights.
