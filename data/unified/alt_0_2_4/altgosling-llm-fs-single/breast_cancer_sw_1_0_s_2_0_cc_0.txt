A linear visualization of chromosome 1 from the hg38 assembly displays multiple genomic tracks. The ideogram track uses a nominal color scheme to visualize chromosomal bands with colors representing different stain types. Key regions are marked with right and left triangles. Below, a gene annotation track shows genes along the chromosome split by strand with blue right-facing and orange left-facing triangles indicating positive and negative strands, respectively.

Two rectangle tracks follow: one in purple marks regions with zero minor copy number in tumor data, and another in pink represents regions with a total copy number in tumors. A connection track illustrates structural variations within chromosome 1, using colored lines to denote categories like tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions, with the line color and stroke indicating the svclass. This comprehensive genomic visualization allows easy comparison and analysis of different structural and functional genomic features.
