A detailed visualization in a hybrid layout combines circular and linear views to depict genomic data using the hg19 assembly. The circular view encompasses five tracks: an ideogram, a point annotation track, two range annotation tracks, and a line-connection track. The ideogram represents chromosome bands with a blue interactive brush linking to a linear view. The linear view presents chromosome 1 using ideograms with text, scatter plots, and annotation tracks. The point annotation track, titled 'Putative Driver,' uses a CSV file with gene names, while the scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' visualizes a VCF file with various mutation types. Annotation tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' display genomic ranges with blue and orange rectangles. Connections are demonstrated between genomic positions, color-coded by structural variations such as 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.' Both views provide comprehensive insights into genomic variations, facilitating detailed genomic analysis.
