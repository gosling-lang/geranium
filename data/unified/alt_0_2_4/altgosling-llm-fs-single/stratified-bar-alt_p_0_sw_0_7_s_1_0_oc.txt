A multi-row bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, displaying four samples across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. Each row represents a different sample: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The height of the bars in each row represents quantitative values for 'peak_min' and 'peak_max'. Each sample is distinguished by a unique color, with a legend provided for clarity. The bars are outlined in black with a stroke width of 0.2. The chart includes a tooltip offering genomic position and peak value details.
