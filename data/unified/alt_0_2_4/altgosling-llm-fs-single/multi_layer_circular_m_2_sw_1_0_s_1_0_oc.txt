A circular area chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying genomic data across chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The chart contains multiple layers of area plots, stratified by different sample categories. Each sample is represented in a unique color. The y-axis shows expression levels, divided into segments with different opacity settings to highlight varying domains of data. The layout features a central radius with an outer and inner boundary, facilitating a detailed comparison of quantitative values across samples. The reference for this visualization is "Graphical perception of Multiple Time Series" by Javed et al., TVCG 2010.
