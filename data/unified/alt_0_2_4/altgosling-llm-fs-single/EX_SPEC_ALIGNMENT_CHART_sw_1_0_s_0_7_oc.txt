The visualization presents a genomics alignment using four distinct charts. A bar chart titled 'Gap' shows genomic gaps with gray bars. Another bar chart titled 'Conservation' displays conservation scores with varying colors. The main chart uses colored rectangles with text to represent different sequences aligned by categories, further arranged across rows. A comprehensive overlay chart incorporates rectangles, a conservation bar chart, and a gap bar chart, enabling an integrated genomic overview. Interactive zoom features are applied, allowing detailed inspection across specific genomic intervals.
