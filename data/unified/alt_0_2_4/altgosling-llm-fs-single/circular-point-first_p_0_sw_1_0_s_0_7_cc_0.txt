The visualization is a circular scatter plot focusing on chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500, utilizing a multivec file. It employs a circular layout with points representing expression values, stratified into rows for four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4.' The samples are visually distinct by their color coding: blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The size of each point is proportional to the 'peak' value. Opacity is set at 0.5 to allow for overlapping points, enhancing the visualization's depth. This detailed representation is ideal for comprehending genetic variation across the specified genomic interval.
