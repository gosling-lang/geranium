The visualization consists of a circular view linked to a linear view, all within a vertical layout. The circular view features five tracks, including an ideogram with a brush, a text annotation track titled 'Putative Driver,' and three range annotation tracks. The 'Putative Driver' track shows black text annotations. The range tracks are titled 'Gain' with sky blue rectangles, and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' with dark orange rectangles. Additionally, a connection track visualizes genomic relations with various color-coded connections representing structural variations like 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.' 

The linear view showcases chromosome 1's ideogram, gene annotations, point and range tracks. The 'Point Mutation' scatter plot illustrates genomic positions using VCF data, colored by mutation subtype. It is followed by 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' tracks using VCF annotations, and a 'Copy Number Variants' track using CSV data, depicted in grey. The views interlink via an interactive brush, allowing navigation and highlighting corresponding genomic regions between the circular and linear representations.
