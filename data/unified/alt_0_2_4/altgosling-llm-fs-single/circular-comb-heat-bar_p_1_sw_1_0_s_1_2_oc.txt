The visualization is a circular layout with two distinct tracks arranged horizontally, each focused on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The left track presents a circular bar chart with four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each category is displayed in a different row, with bars representing genomic positions on the x-axis and expression levels on the y-axis, color-coded by sample. The right track showcases a circular heat map that encodes expression values using color intensity. This track is also stratified by the same four categories and visualizes expression data across genomic intervals on the x-axis. Both tracks include tooltips for genomic start and end positions, expression values, and sample information.
