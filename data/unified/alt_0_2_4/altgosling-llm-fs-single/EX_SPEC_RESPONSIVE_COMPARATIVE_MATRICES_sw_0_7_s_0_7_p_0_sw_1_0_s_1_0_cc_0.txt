A visualization consisting of two overlaid matrix tracks in a horizontal arrangement, showcasing genomic intervals of chromosome 10. The visualization uses HiGlass tile information from two matrix datasets. Both matrices are represented using bar marks with genomic intervals shown on both x- and y-axes. In one track, expression values are represented using gray color intensity, while in the other they are depicted using the viridis color scale. The matrices are positioned in a diagonal manner such that the first occupies the lower-left quadrant, and the second fills the upper-right quadrant, joined at the diagonal. The matrix extents are full for larger screens and adapt to lower-left and upper-right sections on smaller screens, as enabled by responsive design. The visualization is primarily used to explore genomic data visually, with color intensity representing quantitative values and legends provided for each color range.
