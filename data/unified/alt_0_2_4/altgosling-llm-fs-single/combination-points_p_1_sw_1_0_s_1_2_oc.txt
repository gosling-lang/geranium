The visualization displays two linear scatter plots arranged vertically, showing genomic data from chromosome 1 within an interval of 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. The top chart represents scatter plots where each point's position corresponds to genomic coordinates on the x-axis, and expression levels on the y-axis. The size of the points is proportional to expression values, and they are colored by nominal categories ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'), with a semi-transparent opacity for visual clarity. The bottom chart further stratifies this information by plotting each sample in separate rows. Legends are present in both charts to denote category colors, enhancing comprehension. The tooltip functionality provides detailed data insights, including start and end genomic positions and peak values. The assembly used is hg38.
