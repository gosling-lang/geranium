The visualization titled "Breast Cancer Variant (Staaf et al. 2019)" provides a comprehensive analysis of the genetic characteristics of RAD51C- and PALB2-altered triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) using a linear layout with vertical arrangement. It features a circular and linear view connected by linking brushes, focusing on chromosome 1.

The circular view contains five tracks showcasing an ideogram, point annotations, LOH (loss of heterozygosity) in orange, and genomic gains in green. Structural variants are illustrated with colored links: green for tandem duplications, blue for translocations, red for deletions, and orange for inversions. The linear view depicts detailed genomic annotations, including gene symbols, chromosome bands, copy number variations (CNVs), and structural variants for detailed scrutiny.

Additionally, two horizontal linear views at the bottom visualize sequence alignments of chromosome 1 segments via BAM file data. The bar charts convey read coverage in light gray, while pileup tracks indicate structural variants with distinct color coding highlighting different variant types such as deletions, inversions, and duplications. The visualization emphasizes patient-specific genomic aberrations in TNBCs, supporting in-depth genetic exploration.
