The visualization is a linear genomic range annotation track titled "IGV," displaying data on chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The chart is arranged horizontally and stratified by strands, with '+' and '-' rows. It features text labels and rectangles representing gene names, encoded in sky blue. The chart includes lines with white triangular patterns, indicating gene directionality. This visualization implements a filter to focus on gene types and distinguishes strands with opposite-pointing triangles.
