A circular visualization is titled "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements," showcasing genomic data using a circular bar chart, ideograms, and connection links. The layout is static with parallel arrangements and a mixing of bars and links. A genomic bar chart encircles the layout, displaying quantitative values in pink. Two ideograms are included, representing different categories using a range of colors. Links are drawn between genomic positions in the circular chart, colored light gray for all chromosomes except for hs1, which is shown in black. The entire visualization leverages multivec data, CSV data for ideograms, and connection data from a text file, illustrating both structural genomic features and relationships across sequences.
