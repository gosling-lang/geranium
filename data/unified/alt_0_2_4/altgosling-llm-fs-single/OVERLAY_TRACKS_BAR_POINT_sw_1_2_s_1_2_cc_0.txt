The visualization titled "Example: Overlay Tracks" presents variance data for chromosome 3 using a linear layout. The track combines bars and points to depict genomic intervals, with each feature representing the clinical significance of genetic variants. The x-axis shows genomic positions, while the y-axis is categorized by significance levels, including "Pathogenic," "Likely Pathogenic," "Uncertain Significance," and others. Colors such as orange and green differentiate categories, while a legend provides clarity. The data is derived from a BEDDB file, and the visualization utilizes both bars and points for emphasis.
