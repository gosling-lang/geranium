The visualization consists of two circular charts arranged horizontally. The left chart displays genomic data in an area plot format, where the x-axis represents genomic positions on chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500. The y-axis shows quantitative values labeled as "peak," stratified by four samples. Each sample is represented by a different color: blue, orange, green, and red, corresponding to "sample 1" through "sample 4."

The right chart features a within-link visualization, indicating connections within the genomic interval of chromosome 1, specifically between positions 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. Lines connecting genomic regions are colored based on their starting position, utilizing the same color scheme as the left chart. Both visualizations are in a static, circular layout, and employ multi-layered data representation to convey complex genomic relationships.
