A linear genomic visualization of chromosome 1, displaying five tracks with different data types. The first track is an ideogram representing cytoband patterns using rectangular, right, and left triangle marks to indicate various categories. The second track is a genomic position annotation track featuring genes, with triangles indicating gene strand orientation. Rows are stratified by strand type, color-coded in shades of blue and brown. Two subsequent tracks visualize CNV data with rectangles, colored orange and green, reflecting minor and significant copy number changes in tumors. The final track shows structural variant connections, colored by type: tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions.
