A linear layout visualization titled "Example: Semantic Zooming" displays an ideogram with semantic zooming capabilities. The chart highlights different genomic features along chromosomes 1 to Y of the hg38 genome assembly. Each chromosome is depicted as a rectangle colored in light gray and gray based on specific categories. As viewers zoom in past a threshold, additional text labels and triangle marks appear for greater detail. The text labels indicate chromosomal bands, with black and white colors denoting various stain types. Maroon triangles represent centromeric regions. The visualization uses a CSV data source.
