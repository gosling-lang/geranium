A circular visualization showcases genomic data across multiple tracks. The outermost track is a colorful ideogram displaying chromosome bands from a CSV file, with colors signifying different staining types like "gneg," "gpos25," "gpos50," and others. Below, two circular tracks with rectangles represent copy number variations from a CSV file. The first track highlights minor copy number in tumors in green, while the second delineates total copy number in tumors in pink. At the center, a withinLink track visualizes structural variations using connections between genomic positions, with lines color-coded to indicate types such as "tandem-duplication," "translocation," "deletion," and "inversion." The layout, based on the HG38 assembly, features a circular arrangement with a spacing of 1 and a center radius of 0.3.
