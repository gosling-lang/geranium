A dual-chart linear visualization displays genomic data for chromosome 1, from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top chart is an area plot where the x-axis represents genomic position and the y-axis shows quantitative expression levels. It is divided into four rows, each representing 'sample 1' through 'sample 4', with different colors such as orange, green, blue, and purple. The bottom chart is a scatter plot, similarly using genomic position on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, with point size proportional to expression values. Colors in the scatter plot also correspond to samples, offering a categorical distinction among data points.
