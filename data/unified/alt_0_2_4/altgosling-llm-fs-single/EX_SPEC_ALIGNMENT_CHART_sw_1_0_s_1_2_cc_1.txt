The visualization displays genomic data in a linear layout with four tracks.

1. **Bar Chart (Gap)**: Shows gaps in genomic sequences, colored purple with height representing quantitative gap data.
2. **Bar Chart (Conservation)**: Illustrates conservation levels in genome intervals, colored on a gradient from yellow to orange, indicating the degree of conservation.
3. **Rectangles and Text Chart**: Represents genomic bases with rows for different nominal categories. Colored rectangles denote different bases, while accompanying text provides annotations.
4. **Overlay Chart**: Combines multiple track types, including rectangles and bars. Features an interactive brush tool for selecting genomic regions, with overlaid conservation and gap data.

This chart provides an interactive view of genomic alignment, facilitating comparative analysis and data visualization.
