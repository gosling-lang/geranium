**Description:**

The visualization features a linear layout displaying genomic data from the entire genome encoded as 'hg38'. The chart titled "Basic Marks: Text" overlays text annotations representing DNA sequences on chromosomal positions. The x-axis, positioned at the top, presents genomic intervals, whereas the y-axis encodes quantitative values corresponding to 'count'. Text annotations are colored based on categories 'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C', using blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. This visual representation adopts a 'multivec' file structure from a specified URL, with the 'count' data attribute driving text size and readability. The layout stretches to fit a width of 672 and a height of 246, maintaining horizontal orientation in a static linear layout.
