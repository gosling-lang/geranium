A text-based chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file displaying genomic data on the x-axis and nucleotide counts on the y-axis. The genomic range is represented by the field 'start' and 'end' aligned linearly, with a focus on specific nucleotide sequences ('A', 'T', 'G', 'C'). Each base is colored distinctively, corresponding to categories: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. The visualization is titled 'Basic Marks: Text' and subtitled 'Tutorial Examples.'
