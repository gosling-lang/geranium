A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying genomic data for chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500 in a circular arrangement. The chart is stratified by categories with two distinct rows, 'sample 1' and 'sample 2,' colored in different shades for easy distinction. Bars represent the expression values, with the height indicating the range from 'peak_min' to 'peak_max.' Additional features include tooltips providing genomic position, minimum and maximum expression values, and sample names, enhancing interactive exploration. The circular layout emphasizes genomic continuity, facilitating the interpretation of patterns across samples.
