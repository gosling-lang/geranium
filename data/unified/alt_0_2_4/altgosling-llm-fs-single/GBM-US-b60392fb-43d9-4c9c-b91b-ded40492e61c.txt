A circular and linear genomic visualization provides insights into genomic variations and annotations within the assembly hg19. The circular ideogram displays the entire genome with an interactive blue brush, highlighting specific genomic regions. The circular view includes a "Putative Driver" text annotation, and two range annotations titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," depicted in sky blue and dark orange, respectively. A connection track visualizes structural variations such as 'Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion,' using different colors for each category.

The linked linear view focuses on chromosome 1, featuring multiple tracks. An ideogram with triangles indicates genomic sections, while a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" uses colored points to represent mutation types. Additional tracks include gene annotations, insertion and deletion visualizations, and "Copy Number Variants" displayed with gray rectangles. The view is enriched by vertical lines and colored connections that illustrate structural variations within the chromosome.
