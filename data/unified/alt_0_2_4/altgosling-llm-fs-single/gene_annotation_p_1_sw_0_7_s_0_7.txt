A series of six genomic visualization tracks in a linear layout presents chromosome 3 from 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. Each track is an overlay of several components, showing genomic data in different styles. The "Corces et al." track features gene annotations with directional text and rectangles for gene and exon segments, color-coded by strand (blue for positive, red for negative). The "IGV" track displays gene names and positions, using navy for text and rectangles, with white arrows indicating strand direction. The "HiGlass" track similarly shows gene annotations with light blue and red for strands. The "GmGDV" track uses blue and red triangles to mark gene orientation. The "Cyverse-QUBES" track has black text and gray triangles for strands, with light gray rectangles for gene bodies and purple for exons. Each visualization employs horizontal arrangement and is stratified by strands, enhancing the visual interpretation of gene structures across the specified genomic interval.
