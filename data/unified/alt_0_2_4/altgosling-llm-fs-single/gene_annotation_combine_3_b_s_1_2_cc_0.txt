The visualization displays three genomic range annotation tracks, each titled 'HiGlass,' 'IGV,' and 'Corces et al.', arranged vertically in a linear layout. The visual shows data from chromosome 3, within the interval 52,168,000 to 52,890,000.

- **HiGlass:** This track uses blue and orange colors to differentiate strands. Upward arrows represent '+' strands, while downward arrows illustrate '-' strands. Gene names are labeled at specific genomic positions.

- **IGV:** This track also highlights gene locations with text and arrows in pink. The arrow patterns represent gene directions and are colored white for enhanced visibility.

- **Corces et al.:** Similar to 'HiGlass,' this track visualizes strands with blue and orange. Gene names are labeled and the strands are marked with arrows to denote direction.

The visualization is designed to facilitate the study of gene distribution and orientation across different annotations.
