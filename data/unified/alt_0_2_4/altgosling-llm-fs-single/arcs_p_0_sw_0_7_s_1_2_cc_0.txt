A linear arc diagram visualizes genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1,039,000 to 1,041,000. The arcs represent connections between different genomic regions, with colors encoding categories based on the genomic start positions. The diagram features multiple colors such as blue, orange, green, and red. It provides an overview of genomic relationships and is titled "Visual Encoding" with the subtitle "Arcs." The visualization highlights the layout and arrangement of genetic data in a vertically oriented linear style.
