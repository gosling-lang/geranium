The visualization is a heat map displaying genomic interactions using a matrix file, showing the entire genome assembly of hg38 in a linear layout. The genomic intervals are represented on both the x- and y-axes with specified axes on top and left, respectively. Color intensity is used to encode quantitative expression values, with a range in shades of grey. The visualization is static with a defined width of 510 and height of 430.
