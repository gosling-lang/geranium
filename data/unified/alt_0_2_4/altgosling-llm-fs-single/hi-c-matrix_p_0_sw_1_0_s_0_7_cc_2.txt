A Hi-C matrix visualization overlays multiple tracks to represent genomic data and annotations. The matrix covers the genomic interval from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 on the hg38 assembly. Expression values are shown through color intensity, with regions highlighted using varying colors like light blue for vertical lines and pink for horizontal lines. Additional annotations include bars with strokes differentiated by categories and green points, which vary in size based on a quantitative field, symbolizing the height of expression values. This visualization offers a detailed view of genomic interactions across various chromosomes.
