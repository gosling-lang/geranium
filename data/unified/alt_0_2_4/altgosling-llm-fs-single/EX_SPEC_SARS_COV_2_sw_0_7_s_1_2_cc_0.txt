The visualization showcases a linear representation of the SARS-CoV-2 genome using data from various sources like WashU Virus Genome Browser, NCBI, and GISAID. The layout includes multiple overlays. The first overlay features gene annotations with sky blue rectangles and text marking gene symbols. A brush links to detailed views. The second overlay, titled "S Protein Annotation," highlights various protein domains such as RBD and RBM using distinct categorical colors. The third overlay depicts the genome sequence with bars representing base counts, color-coded by base type (A, T, G, C). The final overlay illustrates TRS-L-dependent recombination events with light blue arc connections, providing a full view of the genomic intervals. The visualization emphasizes informative genomic annotations and sequence variations in a comprehensive linear form.
