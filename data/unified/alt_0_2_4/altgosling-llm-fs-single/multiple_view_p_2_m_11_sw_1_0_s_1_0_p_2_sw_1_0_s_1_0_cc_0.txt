A visualization titled "Visual Linking" demonstrates data interaction and exploration across three charts: a circular line chart, an area chart, and a scatter plot. The visualization is designed to update details based on brush selections. 

1. **Circular Line Chart**: This chart displays genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, represented by lines. The chart is stratified by categories (samples 1 to 4), each colored distinctly in blue, orange, green, and red. 

2. **Area Chart**: Exhibiting similar genomic intervals, the area under the curve reflects expression strength. Like the line chart, it is stratified by categories, with areas color-coded accordingly. A brush tool enables linking to other views.

3. **Scatter Plot**: Below the line and area charts, this plot details expression points across chromosome 1 from position 160,000,000 to 200,000,000. Points are color-coded by category, showing expression variability.

The charts are interconnected, allowing users to adjust the brush range to dynamically update data in the scatter plot. The overall layout is vertical, with a brush tool facilitating exploration across dimensions.
