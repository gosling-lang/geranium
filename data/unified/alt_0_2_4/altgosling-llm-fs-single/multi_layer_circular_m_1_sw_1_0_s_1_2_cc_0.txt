A circular line chart in a circular layout visualizes multivec data for chromosome 12, spanning intervals from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. Each line represents a sample, with 16 categories shown in different colors, ranging from blue to teal. The lines display genomic data fields, specifically 'peak' values, across the specified range. The tracks are overlaid based on different 'peak' domains for clearer visualization. The categories are distinguished by colors, with opacity variations used for emphasizing certain ranges. The chart description references a graphical perception study on multiple time series by Javed et al., indicating its relevance in visual analytics.
