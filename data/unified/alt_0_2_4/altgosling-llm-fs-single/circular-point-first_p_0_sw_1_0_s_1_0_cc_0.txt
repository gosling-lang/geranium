A circular scatter plot visualizes a multivec file with genomic data for chromosome 1, spanning from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The layout is circular and static, with a center radius of 0.5, featuring rows for categories 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is represented as a distinct colored point: blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The position on the x-axis represents genomic location, while the y-axis and point sizes correspond to the 'peak' values of expression. The chart provides tooltips highlighting the start and end positions, peak values, and sample names, enabling interactive exploration of the data.
