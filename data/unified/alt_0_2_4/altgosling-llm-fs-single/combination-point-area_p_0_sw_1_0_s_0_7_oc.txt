In this visualization, two distinct charts are arranged vertically. The top chart is a scatter plot representing genomic data along chromosome 1, from positions 1 to 3,000,500. Points depict expression values and vary in size according to a quantitative field named 'peak.' These points are color-coded to denote different samples, such as 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4,' with a legend provided for reference. 

The bottom chart is an area chart, displaying expression along the same genomic axis. It features rows stratified by sample categories, and each category is distinctly colored to match the scatter plot above. This chart utilizes smooth areas to indicate the distribution of genomic data within the same interval. Both charts include tooltips for detailed exploration, revealing additional information about genomic positions and values. The overall layout follows a linear, horizontal orientation, providing a coherent split view of genomic data correlation.
