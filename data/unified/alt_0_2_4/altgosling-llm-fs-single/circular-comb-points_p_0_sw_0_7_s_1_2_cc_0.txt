A circular multi-layered scatter plot visualizing a multivec dataset for chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. The visualization comprises two horizontal views arranged vertically. Each view displays points across genomic positions, stratified by four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each colored distinctly in blue, orange, green, and red. The point size and position on the y-axis represent 'peak' values, providing an interactive representation of genomic data. Both scatter plots have their axes defined at the top, with grid lines on the right view for enhanced quantitative analysis. Transparency is applied to the points with an opacity value of 0.5, enabling better visibility of overlapping data. Tooltips provide additional information including the start and end genomic positions, peak value, and sample name.
