The visualization displays genomic data using a combination of circular and linear views, linked by an interactive blue brush. The circular view represents the entire genome of hg19 with an ideogram and annotation tracks, including 'Gain' in blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange. A connection track highlights structural variations, such as 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.' The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and includes tracks for ideograms, gene annotations, point mutations, and copy number variants. The point mutation track uses a scatter plot to depict mutation distances, colored by subtype (e.g., 'C>A', 'C>T'). The copy number variant track shows quantitative data as gray bars, enhancing genomic interpretation.
