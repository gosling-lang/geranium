The visualization, titled "Visual Encoding" with the subtitle "Arcs," features a linear layout with vertical arrangement and a central radius of 0.8. It highlights connections within chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500, specifically focusing on the interval from 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. The dataset is sourced from a CSV file containing genomic fields. The arcs are color-coded based on the nominal field "s1," presenting various categories in shades of blue, orange, green, and more. The arcs are drawn with a black stroke of 0.5 in width and an opacity of 0.2, spanning a width of 600 pixels and a height of 160 pixels.
