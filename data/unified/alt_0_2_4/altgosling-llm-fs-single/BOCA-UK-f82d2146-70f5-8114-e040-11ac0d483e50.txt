The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view linked by an interactive brush, representing genomic data from the hg19 assembly. The circular view displays the entire genome with five tracks, including an ideogram, a text annotation track titled "Putative Driver," and two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," depicted in blue and orange rectangles, respectively. A connection track visualizes lines between genomic positions based on the category 'svclass,' such as 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.'

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and mirrors the circular view, featuring tracks like a gene annotation track, a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation," and additional range annotation tracks. The scatter plot visualizes VCF data, showing mutations by color-coded subtypes and distance to previous mutations. Other notable tracks include "Copy Number Variants," illustrating quantitative variations in light grey and highlighting Insertions and Deletions with specific colors and rows. This multilevel representation provides a comprehensive overview of the genome's structural variations and mutations.
