The visualization is a dual-track circular chart showing genomic data for chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The left track features a circular bar chart where genomic positions are plotted along the horizontal axis. Expression values are displayed as bars segmented by sample category. The samples — 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4' — are differentiated by color. The right track presents a circular heatmap over the same genomic interval. Expression values are represented by color intensity, with the data stratified into rows for each sample category. Both tracks visualize data from a multivec file, providing insights into the variations across different samples.
