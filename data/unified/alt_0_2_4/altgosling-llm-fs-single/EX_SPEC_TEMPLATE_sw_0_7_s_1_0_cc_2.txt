A visualization in a linear layout features three distinct genomic tracks. The first track is a gene annotation track displaying the chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000, with genes denoted by gray arrows, highlighting their strands and directionality. The second track, focused on chromosome 1 (positions 77,925,299 to 77,925,320), presents a sequence composition visualized through bars representing nucleotide counts (A, T, G, C) in various colors. The final track is an ideogram of chromosome 1, illustrating cytogenetic banding patterns in classic staining colors. The diagrams maintain smooth path transitions, aiding visual interpretation of genomic data. The title is "Track Template In Gosling.js," and it includes a subtitle about the ease of creating complex visualizations.
