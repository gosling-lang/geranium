The visualization consists of a dual-layout design, featuring a circular view above and a linear view below, linked by a blue interactive brush within the circular view. The circular segment represents the entire genome, while the linear part focuses on chromosome 1. The circular view includes tracks such as an ideogram, point annotation for 'Putative Driver,' blue range annotations labeled 'Gain,' orange annotations labeled 'Loss of Heterozyosity (LOH),' and interconnecting lines of various colors indicating different structural variations based on the 'svclass' data field. These categories encompass 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' 'Inversion (TtT),' and 'Inversion (HtH).' The linear view provides a similar set of tracks with added annotations like 'Point Mutation,' where distance to previous mutations is plotted as scatter points colored by mutation subtypes. Additional tracks show insertions and deletions as rectangles, and copy number variants are depicted in gray, illustrating total copy number using vertical placements.
