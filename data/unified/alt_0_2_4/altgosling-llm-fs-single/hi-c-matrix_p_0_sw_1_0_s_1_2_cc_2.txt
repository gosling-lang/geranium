The visualization, titled "Hi-C Matrix," presents a comprehensive view of Hi-C data through a series of overlaid tracks in a linear layout, covering the genomic interval from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000. The main track displays a matrix where the x- and y-axes represent genomic positions, with intensity colors depicting expression values. Annotations include vertical sky blue and horizontal purple lines for reference points on the x and y axes, respectively. Additionally, bars highlighting specific data points are visible, with color-coded strokes representing different categories of genomic data. Green points overlaid on the matrix convey further quantitative values through their size and intensity, enhancing the depth of data interpretation. The matrix and the annotations provide a detailed overview of chromosomal interactions, accompanied by a color legend on the side to aid in deciphering values.
