The visualization consists of two horizontally aligned tracks, both with a linear layout. The top track is a line chart displaying genomic data across chromosome 2, using samples 1, 3, and 4. The lines are colored distinctively with a legend indicating each sample. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis encodes quantitative data related to the "peak" field. The bottom track is an area chart that similarly visualizes genomic data for samples 1 and 2. The filled areas differentiate the samples by color, further emphasizing quantitative variations in the "peak" data field. Both tracks have a consistent width of 1152 pixels and are interconnected by a linking ID, ensuring synchronized genomic positioning on the x-axis.
