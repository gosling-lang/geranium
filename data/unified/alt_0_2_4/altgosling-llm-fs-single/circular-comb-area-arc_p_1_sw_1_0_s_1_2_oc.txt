A circular arrangement visualization features two adjacent charts. The left chart displays connections using a "withinLink" mark, representing genomic intervals on the x-axis of chromosome 1 between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. Colors differentiate categories within these intervals. The right chart is a circular area chart that visualizes multivec data from a genomic perspective, stratified by rows for samples 1 through 4 on chromosome 1. Each area is colored according to the sample category, providing an overview of genomic data spread over the x-axis, with quantitative values represented on the y-axis.
