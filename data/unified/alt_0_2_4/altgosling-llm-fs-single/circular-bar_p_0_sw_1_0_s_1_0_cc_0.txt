The visualization is a circular bar chart with a vertical arrangement. It represents genomic data from the region of chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The data is visualized using bars with genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. The chart is stratified by rows for different samples, specifically "sample 1" and "sample 2". Each sample is represented by a color from a predefined palette, with bars colored in blue and orange. The outer radius of the circular layout is 175 units, and the inner radius is 87.5 units. It includes tooltips that provide genomic position, minimum, and maximum value information for each sample. The data is sourced from a multivec file specified by a URL, with visualization performed in a static horizontal layout.
