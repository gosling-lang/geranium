An area chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, displaying data across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The chart includes four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each represented by different colored areas. The data field 'peak' determines the y-axis values, while the 'position' defines the x-axis values, which come with top-aligned genomic ticks. The color legend is displayed, with samples colored in blue, orange, green, and red. Chart tooltips offer additional information on genomic positions and peak values.
