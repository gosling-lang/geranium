A linear visualization displays various genomic data for chromosome 1 in the hg38 assembly. The top track is a cytoband ideogram, with rectangles and triangles marking regions and features; colors represent different categories. Next, a genomic position annotation track uses triangular glyphs to indicate gene direction, with rows corresponding to gene strands. Below, two charts use colored rectangles to highlight specific genomic intervals: dark orange for minor copy number alterations and green for total copy number gains in tumor samples. The bottom track visualizes structural variations, showing links between positions in chromosome 1. Lines connecting genomic positions are colored based on the type of structural variation, including tandem duplications (green), translocations (blue), deletions (red), and inversions (orange).
