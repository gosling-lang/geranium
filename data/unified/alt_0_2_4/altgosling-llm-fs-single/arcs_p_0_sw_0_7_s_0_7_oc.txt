The visualization titled "Visual Encoding" with the subtitle "Arcs" is a linear layout that shows arc connections of genomic data. It covers a segment of chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs, with the specific region from 103,900,000 to 104,100,000 highlighted. The arcs, represented as connections, are colored to reflect various categories of genomic fields, showing potential overlapping and interactions. The arrangement is vertical, with a center radius of 0.8 and a width of 294 units. The arcs' opacity is set at 0.2, providing a transparent view of overlapping areas. The visualization uses a dataset from a CSV file, which includes chromosome fields and genomic coordinates.
