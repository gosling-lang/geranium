The visualization is a linear layout titled "Visual Encoding" with the subtitle "Arcs". It presents a genomic range from chromosome 1, between positions 1 to 3,000,500, focusing on a specific region between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. The chart utilizes within-link marks to display connections between genomic positions. The connections are color-coded based on the nominal data field 's1', providing a visual distinction of different categories. The arcs are styled with a black stroke and a thickness of 0.5, made semi-transparent with an opacity of 0.2. This layered representation highlights genomic relationships in the specified interval using data from a CSV file.
