A visualization comprising both circular and linear views showcases genomic data from the hg19 assembly. The circular view features a detailed ideogram, showing chromosome positions with a brush linking to the linear view, which focuses on chromosome 1. Tracks in the circular view include "Putative Driver" text annotations, and rectangles illustrating "Gain" in blue and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in orange. Connections in the circular track represent structural variations, color-coded by type: Translocation, Duplication, Deletion, Inversion (TtT), and Inversion (HtH).

The linear view displays genetic data overlaid in various tracks, including an ideogram, point mutations, insertions, deletions, and copy number variants. The "Point Mutation" track highlights individual mutations with points colored by the subtype, such as C>A or T>G, based on VCF file data. Insertions and deletions are differentiated in rows, marked in rectangles. A "Copy Number Variants" track visualizes quantitative genomic data with bars. Vertical lines and triangles on both sides indicate specific genomic features.
