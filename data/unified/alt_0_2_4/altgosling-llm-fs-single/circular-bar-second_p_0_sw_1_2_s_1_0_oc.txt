A circular bar chart in a vertical arrangement visualizes a multivec dataset, focusing on chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The chart displays data from four samples arranged in separate rings: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is represented with distinct colors, including yellow, green, blue, and pink. The x-axis encodes genomic positions, and the y-axis represents quantitative peak values. The data includes tooltips indicating genomic start and end positions, as well as peak values for each category.
