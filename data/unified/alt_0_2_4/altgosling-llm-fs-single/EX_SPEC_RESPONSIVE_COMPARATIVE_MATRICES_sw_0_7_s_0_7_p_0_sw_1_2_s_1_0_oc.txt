The visualization presents aligned genomic matrices visualized as two overlaid triangular plots set at each corner of the main triangle area. Each plot represents genomic data of chromosome 10 displayed along both x and y axes. The x-axis shows genomic intervals labeled at 50 million and 100 million bases. Similarly, the y-axis shows intervals from the same chromosome. The top plot uses a color gradient of pink to represent the quantitative expression values, whereas the lower plot uses a color gradient of grey. The visualization utilizes color intensity to encode expression levels. The two tracks are aligned such that they share a common genomic axis, allowing for visual comparison between different datasets. Interactive features are embedded within the visualization, making it responsive to varying display sizes, and both plots are set to adjust to the responsive layout.
