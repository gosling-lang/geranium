A circular and linear genomic visualization is presented, showing multi-layered data from the hg19 assembly. The circular view includes an ideogram with a blue brush for interactive linking, facilitating navigation and detail exploration. The tracks in the circular layout show copy number 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' highlighted in blue and orange rectangles, respectively. Structural variants are depicted using link tracks with colors corresponding to different types of variations such as 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' 'Inversion (TtT),' and 'Inversion (HtH).'

Below, the linear view focuses on chromosome 1, mirroring the circular layout's genomic range. It features an ideogram, a track with putative driver gene annotations as black text, and a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation,' where points represent mutations encoded by various subtypes, indicated by distinct colors. Range annotation tracks display 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' events with different colors, along with the 'Copy Number Variants' track visualized in grey bars, reflecting the total copy number. This visualization effectively integrates quantitative and categorical genome-wide data for comprehensive analysis.
