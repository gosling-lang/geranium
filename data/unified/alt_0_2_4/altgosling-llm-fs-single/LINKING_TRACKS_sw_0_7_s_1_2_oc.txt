A dual-track visualization displaying genomic data from chromosome 2 using a linear layout. The top track presents a line chart with three samples ('sample 1', 'sample 3', 'sample 4') distinguished by color. Each line represents quantitative expression levels mapped to genomic positions. The bottom track features an area chart showcasing data from two samples ('sample 1' and 'sample 2'), also differentiated by color. Both tracks use the same x-axis representing genomic positions on chromosome 2, enabling direct comparison between the datasets. The assembly used is hg38.
