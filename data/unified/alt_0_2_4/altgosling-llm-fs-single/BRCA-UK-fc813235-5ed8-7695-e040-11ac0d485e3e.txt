The visualization consists of a circular view with interconnected tracks and a linked linear view. The circular view represents the entire genome, depicted as an ideogram with overlaid text and range annotations. It features tracks labeled 'Ideogram,' 'Putative Driver,' 'Gain,' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)', with genomic intervals marked by colored rectangles. A brush tool allows interactions linking to the linear view, which focuses on chromosome 1.

The linear view includes multiple tracks such as a point annotation track, a shader with triangles, genomic range annotations, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation,' and a copy number variant track. The scatter plot utilizes a VCF file to display mutations, with points color-coded by mutation subtypes. Structural variations are shown as connections, categorized by type: 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversions.' Each segment highlights specific genomic features using color and opacity distinctions, providing a detailed multiscale genomic analysis.
