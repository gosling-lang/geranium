The visualization presents a linear ideogram focused on chromosome 7. It features genomic intervals on the x-axis, where the ideogram itself is color-coded to represent different staining patterns: white, shades of gray, and black. Key cytoband labels are annotated with black text, and specific regions are marked with maroon left and right triangles. Underlying data comes from a CSV file, and additional annotation text is overlaid based on JSON data, representing various genes along the chromosome. The figure's responsive layout adapts both height and width dimensions.
