The visualization consists of three linear charts arranged vertically, each illustrating genomic data using Gosling.js. The top chart is a genomic range annotation track displaying genes on chromosome 3, from positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. It uses gray coloring for gene strands and labels. The middle chart is a bar chart on chromosome 1, from positions 77,925,299 to 77,925,320, representing a sequence multivec file. Different bases ('A', 'T', 'G', 'C') are shown as bars with distinct colors, and bases are labeled. The bottom chart is an ideogram for chromosome 1, showing cytogenetic bands with colors indicating different stains like gneg, gpos, and acen. The visualization is titled "Track Template in Gosling.js" and subtitled "Gosling.js enables track templates! This allows creating complex visualizations more easily."
