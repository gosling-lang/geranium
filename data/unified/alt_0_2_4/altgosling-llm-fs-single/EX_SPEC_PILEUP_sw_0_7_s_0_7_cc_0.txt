The visualization is a linear layout consisting of two overlay tracks displaying BAM data. The top track is a coverage bar chart titled "example_higlass.bam," illustrating the number of aligned reads along chromosome 1 between positions 136,750 and 139,450, with silver bars indicating coverage levels. The lower track is a pileup chart using rectangles to display individual reads colored by structural variation types such as 'normal read,' 'deletion (+-),' 'inversion (++),' 'inversion (--),' 'duplication (-+),' and other categories. Each type is represented by distinct colors, and the chart is organized by rows for clarity. The visualization provides an insight into sequence alignment, highlighting structural variations within the specified genomic region.
