The visualization is composed of two circular charts arranged horizontally. The left chart depicts genomic connections on chromosome 1 between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000, with arcs colored by the starting position to signify different categories. The right chart is an area plot that represents a multivec dataset, illustrating genomic positions from 1 to 3,000,500 on chromosome 1. The area is stratified into four rows, each corresponding to 'sample 1' through 'sample 4', with distinct colors indicating different samples. Both charts employ a circular layout with a center radius of 0.5 and are static in nature, highlighting interactions across the genome in a visually compact format.
