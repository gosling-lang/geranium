A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The chart is stratified by two samples, represented by rows, with each sample indicated by distinct colors. The bars encode peak values, with genomic intervals on the x-axis and peak ranges on the y-axis. The chart includes a legend for sample identification, enhancing interpretability. Black strokes outline bars for definition. Assembly used is hg38.
