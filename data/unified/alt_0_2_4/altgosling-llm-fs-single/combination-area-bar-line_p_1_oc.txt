The genomic visualization consists of a linear layout depicting chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. It comprises three stacked tracks: 

1. The top track displays an area chart, stratified by four categories ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'), along the genomic x-axis and expressed on the y-axis. Each category is colored distinctly, with white strokes outlining the areas.
   
2. The middle track shows a bar chart plotting 'peak' values on the y-axis. Each bar's color signifies a different sample category, and the genomic x-axis runs across the top with grids enabled for precise value reading.
   
3. The bottom track is an overlay track featuring both a line chart and a scatter plot. Lines highlight continuous data trends, while points indicate discrete data values. Point sizes are variable based on 'peak' values, and the colors denote different samples. All tracks have tooltips providing details of genomic positions and corresponding peak values.

This visualization provides a detailed representation of expression levels across chromosome 1, facilitating comparisons among multiple samples.
