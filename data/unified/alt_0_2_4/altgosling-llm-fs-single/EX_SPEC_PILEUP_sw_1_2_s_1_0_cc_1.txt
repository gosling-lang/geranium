A genomic visualization in a linear layout depicts sequence alignment using a BAM file for chromosome 1, covering the range between 136,750 and 139,450. The top track is a bar chart displaying coverage data, where the height of each bar represents the number of reads aligned to specific genomic regions. Bars are styled in silver (hex #C6C6C6). Below, a pileup track shows individual reads represented as rectangles, with colors indicating different structural variations including 'normal read', 'deletion (+-)', 'inversion (++/--)', 'duplication (-+)', and others. The read rectangles are styled with different colors such as gray, orange, and red to denote various categories of structural variation. The pileup track is further detailed by rows stratified by nominal metadata, displaying variations with specific colors as indicated in the legend. The track is titled 'example_higlass.bam', and the visualization includes an interactive tooltip feature and a descriptive legend entitled 'Insert Size = 300bp'.
