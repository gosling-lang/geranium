The linear layout visualization displays a series of chromosome 1 segments between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. It consists of seven tracks, alternating between rectangular annotations and connections (links) between genomic regions. 

- **Rectangular Tracks**: Represent genomic intervals using rectangles colored in purple or sky blue, with genomic start and end positions as tooltips.
- **Connection Tracks**: Illustrate links between genomic positions with green or sky blue connections, overlaid with the same data source, creating a visually coherent representation of relationships.

The visualization uses a CSV dataset for genome data, marked clearly with chromosomal start and end points, and employs an opacity effect to subtlety emphasize the interconnections between different segments. The genomic intervals are outlined in dark green for emphasis, and the layout facilitates an easy visual distinction between different genomic regions and the interactions between them.
