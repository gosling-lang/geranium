The visual representation consists of three main charts organized vertically. At the top, there's a linear area chart for chromosome 1, showcasing genomic data across samples 1 to 4. Stratified rows depict categories, with a brush that updates a detailed view below. On the right, a circular line chart mirrors genomic intervals, maintaining category color distinctions. At the bottom, a scatter plot provides detailed exploration of chromosome 1 between 160,000,000 and 200,000,000, using color-coded points to represent different sample categories. The title "Visual Linking" suggests that adjusting the linked brushes updates the detail view.
