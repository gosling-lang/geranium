This circular visualization displays genomic data using the hg38 assembly. It features four concentric tracks, each with distinct data representations. 

1. **Outer Track**: A circular ideogram of the genome. The colors of the rectangles represent various genomic categories, such as "gneg," "gpos25," and others, using shades from white to black.

2. **Second Track**: Shows genomic ranges with dark orange rectangles representing regions where the "minor_cn_tumor" value equals zero from a CSV dataset. 

3. **Third Track**: Displays genomic ranges in green rectangles, indicating regions with "total_cn_tumor" values between 4.5 and 900 from the same CSV dataset. 

4. **Inner Track**: Consists of connections representing structural genomic variations, such as "tandem-duplication," "translocation," "delection," and "inversion," with links shown in colors like green, blue, red, and orange.

The layout effectively visualizes complex genomic data, allowing for the interpretation of structural variations and copy number changes at a glance.
