The visualization consists of three charts arranged vertically, using a linear layout to visualize genomic data for chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The first chart is a scatter plot displaying expression values as points along the y-axis, with size representing the magnitude of 'peak' values. The second chart is an overlay of a line chart and scatter plot, where lines and points illustrate the expression values on the y-axis, with sizes indicating the magnitude. Both charts are stratified into rows by categories named 'sample 1' to 'sample 4', with each category displayed in a different color, such as blue, orange, green, and red. The third chart is a bar chart, presenting genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values using vertical bars on the y-axis. It is also stratified by categories, with colors corresponding to each category. The layout employs a multivec data type, emphasizing genomic and quantitative relationships across multiple samples.
