A circular bar chart and two linear bar charts are displayed in a vertical arrangement. The circular bar chart depicts genomic intervals, using rows to differentiate categories, each represented by distinct colors. The chart includes interactive elements, allowing users to brush and link views. Line connections within the circular chart highlight interactions, colored in pink, with strokes indicating different genomic rearrangement types. Below, two linear bar charts show genomic data for chromosomes 5 and 16, linked to the circular view through interactive brushes. Each chart is stratified by categories, with colors representing different samples: blue for sample 1, orange for sample 2, green for sample 3, and red for sample 4. This comprehensive visualization allows for in-depth genomic analysis across multiple chromosomes.
