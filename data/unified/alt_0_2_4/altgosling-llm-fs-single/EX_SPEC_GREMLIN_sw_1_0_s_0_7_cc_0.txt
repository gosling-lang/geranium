The visualization titled "Gremlin (O'Brien et al. 2010)" consists of three linear tracks representing Chromosome 5 and its structural rearrangements in a genomic context. The top track is a chromosome ideogram showing cytobands with distinct colors indicating different staining patterns. Text labels are overlaid on the stems, and the ideogram integrates a linked brush tool for cross-view interaction. The second track visualizes interchromosomal links connecting segments on Chromosome 5, and categorizes them by source chromosome, distinguished by color and row. The third track, "Rearrangement View," zooms into a specific genomic region, illustrating intrachromosomal links with thicker blue arcs. These views are interconnected, allowing seamless exploration of genomic arrangements across different regions and resolutions.
