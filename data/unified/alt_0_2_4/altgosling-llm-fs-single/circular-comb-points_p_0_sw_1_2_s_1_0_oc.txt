The circular visualization displays data from chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. It features two horizontally arranged scatter plots, each representing genomic data across four samples ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'). The plots use a circular layout with multivec data, utilizing point marks to represent 'peak' values. The data are stratified by sample categories, which are also distinguished by color. The left plot stratifies data by rows per category, while the right plot includes a grid for quantitative comparison. Each point's size is proportional to its 'peak' value. This static visualization emphasizes comparative genomic expression through distinct visual encoding, using a semi-transparent opacity of 0.5 and interactive tooltips for detailed data exploration.
