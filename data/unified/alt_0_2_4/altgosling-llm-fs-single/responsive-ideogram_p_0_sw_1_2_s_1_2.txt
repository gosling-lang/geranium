The visualization depicts a linear ideogram of chromosome 7, with distinct bands shown in a range of shades from white to black, indicating different staining categories like gneg, gpos25, gpos50, gpos75, gpos100, and gvar. The p and q arms of the centromere are marked with maroon triangles. On top of the ideogram, genomic names are labeled in black and white text depending on the category. The ideogram dynamically adjusts size based on responsiveness to both width and height. The x-axis represents genomic positions along chromosome 7.
