A two-track visualization in a vertical linear layout shows genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a scatter plot displaying genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis. Points are sized according to the peak values and colored based on four sample categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The bottom track is a multi-row area chart with genomic positions on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis, stratified by sample categories. Each category is represented by distinct colors, with tooltips providing additional genomic position and value information.
