A circular genomic visualization displaying data for chromosome 1 across two tracks. The left track features a circular line and scatter plot, representing genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis, stratified by four categories ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4') with distinct colors. Points vary in size proportional to the peak value. The right track is a circular bar chart, similarly plotting genomic positions against peak values, with bars colored according to the same categories, enhancing the visualization of expression patterns.
