A visualization is arranged with a circular and a linear view, connected by a blue interactive brush in the circular view. The circular view displays the entire genome, and the linear view zooms into chromosome 1. The circular view includes five tracks: an ideogram, a point annotation track, two range annotation tracks, and a line-connection track. It highlights genomic ranges for 'Gain' in blue rectangles and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in red rectangles. Line connections illustrate various structural variations like 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' and 'Inversion.'

In the linear view, additional tracks feature: 

- A gene annotation track showing gene locations and structures.
- A scatterplot visualizing point mutations with distances to previous mutations, colored by mutation subtype.
- Two range annotation tracks highlighting 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' rows and visualizing copy number variants (CNVs) in gray rectangles, reflecting the 'total_cn' values.

Overall, the visualization uses color and shape to differentiate genomic events, supported by interactive exploration linking the circular and linear views.
