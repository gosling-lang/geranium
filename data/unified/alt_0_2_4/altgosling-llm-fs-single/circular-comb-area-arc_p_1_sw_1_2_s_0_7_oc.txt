The visualization comprises a circular layout featuring two distinct tracks. On the left, a circular chart with connections visualizes genomic links on chromosome 1, specifically between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. Different categories are represented by colors along the connections. On the right, another circular chart displays an area plot stratified by sample categories, also colored differently. The genome is marked on the x-axis, while expression values are represented on the y-axis across multiple samples, specifically 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.'
