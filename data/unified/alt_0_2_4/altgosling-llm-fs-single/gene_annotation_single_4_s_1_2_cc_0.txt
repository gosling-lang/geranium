The visualization is a linear layout display of a genomic range annotation track titled "GmGDV," focusing on chromosome 3 in the interval of 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. It consists of a vertical arrangement of views, with text indicating gene names positioned along the axis at their respective genomic start points. The genes are displayed with directional markers: right-facing triangles for the positive strand (color-coded blue) and left-facing triangles for the negative strand (color-coded orange), with exons shown as small rectangles. Lines connect the start and end points of the genes, highlighting their spans. The layout effectively visualizes gene annotations using a multi-color scheme to differentiate the strand orientations.
