A circular multi-line chart visualizes a multivec file for chromosome 12, spanning from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The data is stratified by rows into categories 'sample 1' through 'sample 8,' with 'sample -' filtered out. Each category is represented by a differently colored line, indicating expression values (peak) on the y-axis without an axis display. The inner radius is 60, and the outer radius extends to 200, reflecting data variations across the genome interval.
