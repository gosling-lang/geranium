The visualization titled "Basic Marks: Triangles" shows a genomic position annotation track in a linear layout using data from a BEDDB file. It features two types of triangular marks: right-pointing triangles for the '+' strand and left-pointing triangles for the '-' strand. The x-axis represents genomic positions across various chromosomes, while rows are stratified by strand categories. These categories are visually distinguished using two colors: blue for the '+' strand and orange for the '-' strand. The chart utilizes an opacity of 0.8 for the triangles and includes a subtitle "Tutorial Examples." The visualization spans a width of 800 units and a height of 100 units.
