The visualization consists of two circular scatter plots arranged horizontally. Each plot represents genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. The left plot features rows for four samples, each color-coded distinctly with blue, orange, green, and red dots representing samples 1 to 4. The points' sizes and positions are determined by peak values, offering a visual of expression levels per sample category. The right plot is similar but focuses on peak distribution with grid lines on the y-axis, maintaining the same color scheme and arrangement. Both plots incorporate interactive tooltips for precise genomic location and expression value details, enhancing data exploration.
