The visualization is a linear, vertically arranged genomic plot focused on chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. It consists of two main views:

1. **Top View (Overlay Track)**:
   - This view combines a line chart and a scatter plot.
   - The x-axis represents the genomic position, while the y-axis indicates quantitative expression values.
   - Four samples ('sample 1' to 'sample 4') are visualized, each represented by distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red.
   - The scatter plot points vary in size based on expression peak values, providing an additional dimension of data.
   - Rows categorize the samples, and tooltips provide interactive information about positions, values, and samples.

2. **Bottom View**:
   - This view displays an area chart.
   - Like the top view, the x-axis shows genomic positions, while the y-axis indicates expression values.
   - The area under the curve is colored to represent different samples, aiding in the clear differentiation of each sample's expression profile.
   - Sample data is stratified into categories using distinct colors, enhancing traceability across genomic intervals.

Overall, the visualization is designed for genomic data exploration, enabling detailed analysis of expression patterns across chromosome 1 with interactive elements.
