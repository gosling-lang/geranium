A heatmap in a linear layout visualizes genomic interactions. The x- and y-axes represent genomic intervals from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000. The visualization uses a matrix file from hg38 assembly. The intensity of color encodes quantitative data, following a 'hot' color scheme. Both axes feature genomic intervals without overlap, enhancing visual clarity. The visualization effectively encodes the expression values of genomic data, making it an informative tool for genomic analysis.
