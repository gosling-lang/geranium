The visualization displays two charts in a vertical linear layout, focusing on a genomic range on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is an area chart where the x-axis represents genomic positions and the y-axis represents quantitative expression values. This chart is divided into four rows, each corresponding to 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', with each area colored differently for easy categorization. The bottom track is a scatter plot showing the same genomic range, with the position of points indicating expression values and size denoting the magnitude of 'peak' values. Each point's color corresponds to one of the four samples, and an opacity of 0.5 allows visualization of overlapping data points. Both tracks include a legend for categories and tooltips providing start and end genomic positions, expression values, and sample labels.
