The visualization features a circular and a linear view arranged vertically. The circular view includes a genome-wide ideogram with tracks depicting gain and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) as colored rectangles: sky blue for gain and dark orange for LOH. Additionally, lines indicate genomic translocations, duplications, deletions, and inversions (both TtT and HtH), each differentiated by color and stroke style. The linear view zooms into chromosome 1, displaying several tracks: an ideogram track, "Putative Driver" annotations using text, point mutations from VCF files visualized as a scatter plot, and insertion/deletion data shown in rows with rectangles. The "Copy Number Variants" track further depicts quantitative variations as gray bars. A blue interactive brush in the circular view links both views, allowing navigation across the genome.
