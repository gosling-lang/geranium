The visualization is a linear layout chart displaying insertions and deletions from a VCF file. It features genomic positions on the x-axis across various chromosomes including chr2, chr4, chr7, chr11, chr16, and chrX. The chart is stratified into two rows representing 'Insertion' and 'Deletion,' each indicated by colored rectangles. Insertions are shown in one color, and deletions in another, allowing easy comparison. The visual encoding includes a stroke and color distinction for both mutation types. Additional text annotations provide details about the genomic alterations, displayed in white for contrast. The background is styled in a light gray (#F6F6F6) to enhance readability, with the visualization structured to adapt to different zoom levels for detailed exploration based on the view's width. Tooltip information includes genomic position, mutation type, and qualitative details such as alternate and reference alleles, enriching the interactive analysis.
