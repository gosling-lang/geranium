The visualization is a genomic bar chart in a linear layout, illustrating a multivec file across the entire genome assembly hg38. The bars represent expression values from various genomic positions defined as 'peak'. The x-axis is genomic, showing chromosome intervals, while the y-axis quantifies expression. Bars are consistently sized and colored sky blue, with a title "Basic Marks: bar" and subtitle "Tutorial Examples".
