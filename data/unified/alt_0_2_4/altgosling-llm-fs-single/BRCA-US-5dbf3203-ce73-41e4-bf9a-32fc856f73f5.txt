A visualization consisting of a circular and linear layout. The circular layout displays an ideogram, annotated with a 'Putative Driver' track in black text. It features annotation tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)', with blue and orange rectangles respectively. Connections represent genomic structural variations, colored and styled by categories like 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion'. A brush selector links the circular view to a linear view. The linear layout covers chromosome 1, incorporating tracks for ideogram, point mutations in a scatter plot, and gene annotations. Tracks for 'Copy Number Variants', 'Insertion', and 'Deletion' display genomic data. The bottom track illustrates structural variations with curved connections, each categorized by different colors. The visualization is interactive, providing details on hover and other mouse events.
