A linear bar chart visualizes genomic data from chromosome 12, spanning from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The chart is stratified into rows based on categories, with each category assigned a distinct color, representing different samples. The vertical axis represents quantitative expression values. The chart features responsive height adjustments based on its dimensions, allowing for detailed views at different thresholds. The data source is a multivec file filtered to exclude certain samples. According to Javed et al.'s study on the graphical perception of multiple time series, this visualization aims to optimize data comprehension.
