A linear multivec point plot in vertical arrangement displays genomic data across chromosome 1, ranging from 1 to 3,000,500. The plot is stratified into four rows, each representing samples named 'sample 1' to 'sample 4.' Points encode the 'peak' value for both position and size, with colors differentiating samples (blue, orange, green, red). Each row corresponds to a sample, and points of varying size and opacity represent expression levels, enhancing visual distinction. The visualization facilitates examination of genomic expression patterns across samples, with tooltips providing interactive data insights.
