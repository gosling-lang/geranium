A circular scatter plot with multiple categories visualizes a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. Each point represents genomic regions with expression values shown on the radial axis. The plot is stratified into 16 categories, each represented by a different color, excluding 'sample -'. The opacity varies across five bands, indicating different expression value ranges, and points within each band are aligned in a circular arrangement. The reference study is Javed et al., highlighting graphical perception of multiple time series.
