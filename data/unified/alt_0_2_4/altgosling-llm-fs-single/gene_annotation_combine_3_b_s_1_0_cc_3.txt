This visualization displays three genomic range annotation tracks in a linear layout from three data sources: HiGlass, IGV, and Corces et al. Each track covers chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The HiGlass track uses both blue for the positive strand and orange for the negative strand, with various genomic features such as genes and exons indicated by triangles, texts, and rectangular shapes. The IGV track features green text and rectangles, with white lines overlaid to denote strands using patterns. Meanwhile, the Corces et al. track has similar genomic annotations with smaller fonts and rectangles, also using blue and orange to differentiate strands. Each track is vertically stratified by strand, allowing for clear comparison across data sources.
