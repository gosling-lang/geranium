The circular visualization consists of two distinct tracks. The left track is an area chart that represents genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. It stratifies by rows based on four samples, each colored uniquely. Data fields include 'sample' for category differentiation and 'peak' for quantitative values. The right track is a connection chart showing paired genomic regions within the same chromosome, highlighting structural variations. The x-axis displays genomic intervals, and each link is colored by its start position. The visualization uses a multivec data type for the area chart and CSV for connection data.
