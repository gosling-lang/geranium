The visualization is a circular area chart displaying genomic data over chromosome 12, ranging from positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The layout is circular, and the data is presented as multiple overlapping layers of area marks. Each layer is colored differently based on the 'sample' category, with colors including shades of blue, orange, green, red, purple, and others. The y-axis represents quantitative data named 'peak,' with specific domains for different opacity levels. The chart stratifies samples into rows, visually distinguishing them through color, with opacity adjustments highlighting various data ranges for clarity. The visualization references Javed et al. on the graphical perception of multiple time series.
