A genomic visualization in a linear layout displays data for chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track presents a multi-line chart showing quantitative peak values for four samples, distinctively colored and aligned vertically. The x-axis represents genomic positions, and the y-axis denotes the peak values, scaled to size. The bottom track illustrates a bar chart format capturing the same samples and genomic positions. Bars are colored according to sample categories, providing a comparative view of expression levels. Tooltips enrich interactivity by revealing detailed genomic position and quantitative peak information.
