The visualization is a layered line chart and scatter plot in a vertical arrangement, presented in a linear layout. It spans chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. Each line represents a multivec data file's sample category (‘sample 1’ to ‘sample 4’). Peaks in expression values are depicted by different colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The line height reflects quantitative data, showing genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Points vary in size based on the ‘peak’ field values, with a legend indicating category colors.
