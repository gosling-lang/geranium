The circular visualization titled "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements" features a multi-layered display showcasing genomic data. It consists of a circular bar chart, two circular ideograms, and a circular chart with connections. The outer layer is a bar chart representing genomic intervals on the x-axis and quantitative peaks on the y-axis, colored in sky blue. The layers include ideograms, with rectangular marks indicating different categories by color. Between the ideograms, a network of links connects genomic positions, with connections displayed in varying shades of purple based on the categorical values of genomic data. The layout is static, circular, and stacked, with a centered radius, highlighting the parallel arrangement of genomic interactions.
