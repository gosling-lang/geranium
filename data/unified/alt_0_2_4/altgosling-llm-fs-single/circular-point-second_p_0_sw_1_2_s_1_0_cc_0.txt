A circular scatter plot displays genomic data along chromosome 1, covering the interval from 1 to 3,000,500. Points represent expression values with their position related to genomic positions and size corresponding to quantitative values of 'peak'. Categories are identified by colors: blue for 'sample 1', orange for 'sample 2', green for 'sample 3', and red for 'sample 4'. The plot uses opacity to enhance visualization, and a legend distinguishes the samples. Data tooltips provide detailed genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample information, making the visualization interactive and informative.
