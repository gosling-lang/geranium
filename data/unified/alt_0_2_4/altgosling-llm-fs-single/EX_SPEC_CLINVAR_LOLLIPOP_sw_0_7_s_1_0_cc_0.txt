The visualization comprises three linear genomic range annotation tracks, displaying chromosome 13 at multiple scales. Within each view, data is represented using HiGlass, highlighting distinct gene annotations and ClinVar significance scores. The first track presents genomic intervals marked by right and left triangles, text labels, and lines, stratified by strand type ('+' and '-') with colors blue and orange, respectively. Rectangles represent exons. Bars and points visualize significance categories, such as 'Pathogenic' and 'Benign,' with corresponding colors, and their counts are shown with multi-colored bars. Interactivity is provided through zoom-level-based visibility changes, emphasizing various details at specific zoom levels. The use of colors spans across genes and significance scores, offering an informative and interactive genomic exploration.
