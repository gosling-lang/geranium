A circular area chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying chromosome 1 ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500 in a circular layout. The chart uses four categories labeled 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each represented by a distinct color. Each category is shown in separate rows, and the expression levels are depicted using area marks. The area is outlined in white with a stroke width of 0.5. The chart is static, with a center radius of 0.5, and it includes a legend for category colors.
