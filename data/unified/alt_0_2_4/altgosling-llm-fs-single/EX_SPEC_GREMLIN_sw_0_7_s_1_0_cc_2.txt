A detailed genomic visualization titled "Gremlin (O'Brien et al. 2010)" consists of several tracks focusing on Chromosome 5. The main view includes an ideogram representing various genomic bands in grey, black, and pink, with annotations provided both above and below the track. Below the ideogram, duplicated segments are depicted using arcing connections, colored by matching regions on Chromosomes 4, 5, and 6, where Chromosome 5 is shaded in blue, Chromosome 4 in orange, and Chromosome 6 in green. These connections are brushed into adjacent views. The "Region of Interest" further zooms into 68-71 Mb, detailing duplicated sequences in a stacked format by chromosome. Another segment, titled "Rearrangement View" at 69-69.28 Mb, shows duplicated segment connections in a sparse format. Color is used strategically throughout to distinguish chromosome segments, enhancing clarity and cohesion in showcasing genomic rearrangements and duplications.
