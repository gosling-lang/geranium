A circular bar chart visualizes genomic intervals of chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The visualization consists of two layers of bars representing samples 'sample 1' and 'sample 2,' each displayed with distinct colors. The x-axis encodes genomic positions, while the y-axis spans from 'peak_min' to 'peak_max' values. Each row corresponds to a sample, with categorical colors indicating the sample distinction. A legend accompanies the chart, enhancing the ease of identifying each sample's representation. Bars are outlined in black with a slight stroke width for added clarity.
