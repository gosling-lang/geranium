The visualization consists of three horizontally arranged bar charts displaying genomic data from cistrome-multivec files across different chromosomes. Each chart represents data for chromosome intervals between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. 

- The first chart shows data for chromosome 12, with bars shaded in purple. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis indicates quantitative peak values.
  
- The second chart displays data for chromosome 9, also in purple, maintaining the same genomic and quantitative configurations as the first chart.
  
- The third chart returns to chromosome 12 data, but this time the bars are colored green. Despite the color variation, the genomic and quantitative axes remain consistent across all charts.

Each bar chart is linked, allowing coordinated exploration across the chromosome views. The stroke of the bars is set to white, providing clear delineation, with a consistent width and height configuration for comparative analysis.
