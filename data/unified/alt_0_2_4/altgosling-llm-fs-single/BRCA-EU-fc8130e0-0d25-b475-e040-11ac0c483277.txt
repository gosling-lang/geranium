The visualization comprises both circular and linear views linked by a blue brush, portraying genomic data of hg19. The circular view showcases a genome-wide ideogram with chromosome labels, including a title 'Ideogram.' It contains tracks depicting 'Gain' with sky-blue rectangles and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' with orange rectangles, alongside a track showing structural variation with category-based colored connections. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, featuring similar tracks: a gene annotation with text, scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation' where points represent genomic positions and colored by mutation subtype, and tracks for insertions and deletions categorized by color. A 'Copy Number Variants' track shows quantitative data in gray bars. The diagram effectively illustrates chromosomal alterations and annotations, enhancing genomic insights.
