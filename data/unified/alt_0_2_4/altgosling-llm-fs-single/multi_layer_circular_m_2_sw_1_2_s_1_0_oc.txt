The visualization is a circular chart displaying data in a multi-row format, focusing on chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. It uses an area mark to represent quantitative values associated with peaks. Each concentric ring in the chart corresponds to different samples, colored distinctly. The opacity varies across tracks to emphasize different value ranges, providing detailed exposure to data density. The chart effectively layers genomic data, with each row representing a continuous peak expression arranged by sample, based on a multivec file. Reference made to the graphical perception study by Javed et al. in TVCG 2010.
