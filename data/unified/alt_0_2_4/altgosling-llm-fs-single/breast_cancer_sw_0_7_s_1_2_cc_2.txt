A linear genomic visualization comprises five tracks, displaying data from chromosome 1. The first track is an ideogram with rectangles and directional triangles, where colors represent different genomic stains. The second track is a gene annotation track, showing forward and reverse strands with blue and orange triangles, respectively. The third track presents genomic ranges in purple rectangles, filtered for a specific condition. The fourth track shows additional genomic ranges in green rectangles, highlighting regions with a high total copy number. The final track displays genomic connections with lines in various colors, representing structural variations such as tandem duplication and translocation. The linking of tracks allows for detailed exploration of genomic intervals across separate data layers.
