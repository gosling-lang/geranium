The visualization consists of two tracks in a circular layout, representing genomic data for chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500. The left track features a connection chart displaying interactions within genomic intervals from a CSV file. Each connection is colored based on the 's1' field, showcasing different categories with black stroke lines for emphasis. The right track contains an area chart derived from a multivec file, with genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative 'peak' values on the y-axis. It is stratified by four samples ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'), with colors differentiating the samples. Both tracks are organized vertically, centered in the layout, and maintain static properties.
