A bar chart with a linear layout visualizes multivec data for chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500 on the hg38 assembly. The height of the bars represents quantitative data fields labeled 'peak.' The chart is stratified by categories 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4,' each colored differently with blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis shows genomic position intervals, while the y-axis displays peak values with grid lines for better visualization. A tooltip provides detailed genomic positions and sample information for each bar.
