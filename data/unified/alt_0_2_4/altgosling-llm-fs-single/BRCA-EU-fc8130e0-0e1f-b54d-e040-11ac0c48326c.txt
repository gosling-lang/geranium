A genomic visualization consists of a circular and a linear view, both arranged vertically. The circular view features five tracks, including an ideogram, point annotation, two range annotations ('Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)'), and a line-connection track. This view displays the entire genome, highlighting genomic regions with blue and red rectangles, and shows connections between genomic positions using various colors to represent different structural variation categories such as 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.' An interactive blue brush allows selection of genomic regions, linking them to the linear view.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, featuring nine tracks. It includes an ideogram, gene annotation, 'Point Mutation' scatterplot, 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' VCF tracks, 'Copy Number Variants' CSV track, and others with rectangles and connections. The scatterplot visualizes mutations, with positioning based on the distance to previous mutations and color coding according to mutation subtypes. Rectangles in the range annotation tracks are color-coded, with yellow and green for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion,' and grey for 'Copy Number Variants,' indicating quantitative data fields. The visualization is styled with light gray outlines and provides tooltip support for detailed information on genomic positions and mutations.
