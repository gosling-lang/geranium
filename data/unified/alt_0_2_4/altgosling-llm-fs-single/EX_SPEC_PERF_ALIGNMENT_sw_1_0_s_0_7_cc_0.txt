The visualization titled "Smoother Zoom" consists of two linear arranged charts, "New Approach: Stretching Tiles" at the top and "Original Approach" at the bottom. Both use CSV data to show genomic information as colored rectangle tiles aligned side by side. Each chart features no genomic axis, using color to signify different base categories. Text annotations appear based on visibility conditions determined by zoom level. The visualization intent is to demonstrate that stretching elements can replace redrawing them during zoom actions, as indicated by the subtitle.
