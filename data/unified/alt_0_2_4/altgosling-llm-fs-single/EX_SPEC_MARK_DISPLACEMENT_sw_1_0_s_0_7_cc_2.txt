A vertical visualization composed of multiple genomic tracks displays data across chromosomes 2, 3, and 17, utilizing displacement to manage visual overlaps. At the top, a track titled “hg38 | Transcript (Max. 15 Rows)” shows transcript data on chromosome 3 between positions 142,500,000 and 143,000,000. Genes are visualized with arrows in rows, where blue and orange distinguish strands. Below, a track titled "Likely Benign" displays positions on chromosome 2 with points and text annotations identifying base pairs. Additionally, purple links connect genomic positions within this region. At the bottom, a track visualizes ClinVar significance data on chromosome 17 from 43,080,000 to 43,120,000, marked by colored points stratified by pathogenicity levels, such as "Pathogenic" and "Likely Benign." The visualization is framed with a red rectangle border, indicating a specialized styling choice.
