A circular and linear visualization display genomic data using hg19 assembly. The circular view features an ideogram, text annotations, and range annotations for 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH).' Connections are shown using curved lines representing structural variations like 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' and others, color-coded for clarity.

The linear view aligns with chromosome 1 and displays ideograms, text annotations for 'Putative Driver,' and a gene annotation track showing exons and genes with directional arrows. A scatter plot, titled 'Point Mutation,' illustrates genome alterations with color-coded points for mutation subtypes. Additionally, range annotations highlight 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' events and 'Copy Number Variants,' represented by bars, capturing quantitative changes across the genomic interval. The linking brush in the circular view highlights specific genomic regions in the linear view for interactive exploration.
