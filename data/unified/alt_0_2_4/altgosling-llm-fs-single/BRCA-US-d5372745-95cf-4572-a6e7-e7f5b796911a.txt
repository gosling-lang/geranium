The visualization consists of a complex genomic analysis represented through both circular and linear views. The circular view at the top showcases the entire genome with various tracks: a chromosomal ideogram, text annotations, genomic range tracks, and connections indicating structural variations. It features categories such as 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)', marked with sky blue and dark orange rectangles respectively, around the genome circle. Connection lines display structural variations in multiple colors like green and purple, representing 'Translocation', 'Duplication', etc.

Below, the linear view focuses on chromosome 1 with detailed tracks for specific genomic features. It includes a genome ideogram, gene annotations, and point mutations shown in a scatter plot, with points colored according to mutation types like C>A, T>G, etc. There are also range tracks for insertions, deletions, and copy number variants identified in gray bars. Interactive elements in both views, like a brush in the circular plot, allow for linked exploration of specific chromosome regions. The visualization is designed to facilitate detailed genomic analysis by integrating extensive data with interactive features for exploring genomic variations across chromosomes.
