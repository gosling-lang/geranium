A circular chart displays genomic data from chromosome 1, with intervals ranging from 1 to 3,000,500. The left circular track is a multicolored bar chart, stratified into four rows, each representing a distinct sample out of "sample 1" to "sample 4." Colors like blue, orange, green, and red indicate different samples. The height of each bar signifies quantitative data for "peak" values at specific genomic positions. The right track is a circular heat map where color intensity encodes peak expression values. Both tracks are interactive, containing tooltips detailing start and end genomic positions, peak values, and sample information. The layout is circular with a center radius, highlighting a compact visual representation of genomic intervals.
