A linear layout visualizes genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. The visualization includes seven tracks with alternating rectangles and connections. The rectangles represent genomic intervals and are colored in pink and green, with a light opacity for visibility. The connections, also known as links, are visualized in green and sky blue, showing relationships between the intervals. The dataset is derived from a CSV file, with genomic fields indicating start and end positions, allowing precise positioning on the x-axis. The visualization employs subtle styling features like outlines and tooltips for enhanced interactivity and data exploration.
