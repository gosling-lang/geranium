A vertically arranged linear chart visualizes a multivec file displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The chart employs an area mark to represent quantitative peaks for four samples ('sample 1' through 'sample 4'), stratifying them into separate rows. Each sample is assigned a distinct colorâ€”blue, orange, green, and red respectively. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis shows peak values. The stroke is white, enhancing visual separation. Tooltip information includes genomic start and end positions and peak values for each sample.
