The visualization consists of two vertically arranged scatter plots, each representing genomic data from chromosome 1 in a linear layout with an interval ranging from 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. The top plot is stratified into four rows, each depicting data points for different samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The expression values are depicted by points whose positions on the y-axis and size encode a quantitative field named 'peak'. Each sample is color-coded using distinct colors such as blue, orange, green, and red. The bottom scatter plot displays a similar set of data points without row stratification, showing a more comprehensive view of the peak values across the genomic interval. Both plots use opacity to differentiate overlapping points and include interactive tooltips that provide additional genomic and sample information when hovered over. The design emphasizes data density and variability captured in a multivec file format.
