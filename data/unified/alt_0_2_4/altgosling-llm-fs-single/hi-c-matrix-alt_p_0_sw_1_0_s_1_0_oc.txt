The visualization, titled "Hi-C Matrix," is presented in a linear layout to explore genomic data. The x-axis spans genomic intervals from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000. The primary track displays a Hi-C matrix, where genomic interactions are color-encoded on both axes. Multiple tracks overlay this matrix.

1. **Matrix Track**: Displays genomic intervals on both axes, with color intensity indicating expression levels.
2. **Vertical Lines**: Red lines highlight specific genome positions on the x-axis.
3. **Horizontal Lines**: Blue lines emphasize particular locations on the y-axis.
4. **Bar Track**: Genomic intervals are further annotated, with stroke color representing chromosome categories.
5. **Point Chart**: Shows genomic data with points varying in size based on the 'value' field, and colored steel blue.

The matrix uses light gray as the background, with additional styling including dashed lines. The visualization is static, yet comprehensive, enabling a detailed examination of chromosomal interactions and annotations.
