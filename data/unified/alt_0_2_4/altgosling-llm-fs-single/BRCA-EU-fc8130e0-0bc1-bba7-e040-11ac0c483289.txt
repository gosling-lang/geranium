The visualization features a circular and linear layout connected by a blue interactive brush. The circular view displays the entire human genome, highlighting specific genomic regions with tracks such as an ideogram, point annotations, range annotations titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' and connection lines representing structural variations. Categories include 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' and 'Inversion,' color-coded for clarity.

In the linear view, focused on chromosome 1, similar tracks appear with additional annotation for genes, point mutations, and variation types. The 'Point Mutation' scatterplot shows genetic variations with color-coded subtypes. The 'Copy Number Variants' track shows quantitative data as bars. The use of color and layout effectively distinguishes different types of genomic data, making complex information accessible and interpretable.
