A circular and linear view are arranged vertically. The circular view features the entire genome, and the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. In the circular view, five tracks are displayed: an ideogram, a text annotation track labeled 'Putative Driver', two range tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' showing regions in blue and orange, and a track showing genomic connections in various colors to represent 'Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion'. The positions and colors in these tracks are based on different structural variations. 

The linear view mirrors the circular view, with additional details. It includes a point mutation scatter plot visualizing a VCF file where each point's position indicates the mutation distance and its color denotes subtype. The view also contains a gene annotation track with labeled genes and tracks displaying 'Copy Number Variants' and specific mutations like 'Gain' and 'LOH'. The latter tracks use colored rectangles and lines to convey data, with a light gray color covering the background of various structural variation categories.
