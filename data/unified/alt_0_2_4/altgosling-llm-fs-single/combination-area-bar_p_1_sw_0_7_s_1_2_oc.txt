A linear visualization of genomic data for chromosome 1, covering the interval from 1 to 3,000,500. This visualization features two tracks. The top track is a bar chart representing multivec data, with genomic intervals along the x-axis and expression values represented by bars along the y-axis, stratified by the categories 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' Each category is displayed in a different color. The bottom track is an area chart with similar categorical stratification, showcasing expression as colored areas. Both tracks use the data field 'peak' for expression values and are equipped with tooltips for interaction. The arrangement enhances comparative analysis of expression across samples within the specified genomic range.
