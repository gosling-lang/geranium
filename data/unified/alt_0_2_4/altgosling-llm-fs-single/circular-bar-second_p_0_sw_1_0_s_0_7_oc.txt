The visualization is a circular bar chart displaying genomic data for chromosome 1, from position 1 to 3,000,500. It uses a layout that stratifies data by samples across four distinct rows: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is represented using different bar colors. The x-axis shows genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative expression values. The multivec data source informs the chart's configuration. The chart includes a tooltip displaying start and end positions, as well as peak values for each sample. This effective design allows easy comparison of genomic data across different samples.
