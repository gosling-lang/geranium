The visualization titled "Mark Displacement" demonstrates the repositioning of genomic marks to prevent visual overlap. It consists of three sections covering different genomic regions: chromosome 3, chromosome 2, and chromosome 17. The first section shows a linear arrangement of transcripts for hg38, utilizing up to 15 rows with marks like triangles and lines in blue and orange to indicate strand direction. The middle section, titled "Likely Benign," highlights genomic positions with points and text annotations, and blue connections indicate relationships. The bottom section focuses on chromosome 17, using points to represent pathogenic significance, color-coded across various categories. The visualization employs displacement techniques such as "pile" and "spread" to manage overlapping marks effectively.
