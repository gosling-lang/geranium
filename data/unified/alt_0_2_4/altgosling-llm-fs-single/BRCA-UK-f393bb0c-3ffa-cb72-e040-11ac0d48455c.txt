The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view to represent genomic data. The circular view, which includes an ideogram and annotation tracks, represents the entire genome with tracks showing gains, losses, and various structural variations, highlighted in distinct colors. An interactive brush links to a linear view below.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and contains multiple tracks including ideogram, text annotations, point mutations, and copy number variants, among others. Interactive features and color-coded categories enhance data interpretation, allowing for exploration of connections between genomic positions. The annotations highlight key mutations and structural variations like translocations, duplications, deletions, and inversions, each uniquely colored for easy differentiation.
