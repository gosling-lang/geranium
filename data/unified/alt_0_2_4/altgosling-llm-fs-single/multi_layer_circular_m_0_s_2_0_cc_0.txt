A circular scatter plot using a multivec file, visualizing chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The visualization features points representing 'peak' values for samples across six categories. Each category, such as 'sample 1' and 'sample 2', is displayed in different colors like blue, orange, and green. Arranged in rows, the layout is circular with data points colored according to the categories. The chart uses a genomic x-axis and a quantitative y-axis without an axis line. The data is filtered to exclude specific samples ('sample -').
