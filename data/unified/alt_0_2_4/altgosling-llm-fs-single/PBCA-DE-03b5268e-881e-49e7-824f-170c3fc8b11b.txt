A circular ideogram and a linear view are arranged vertically, showing genomic data. The circular view represents the entire genome with tracks including an ideogram, a point annotation track (labeled 'Putative Driver'), and two range annotation tracks showcasing 'Gain' in blue rectangles and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange. The linear view highlights chromosome 1, featuring various tracks such as a gene annotation track, a scatterplot for 'Point Mutation' colored by mutation type, and tracks for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion.' Connections between genomic positions are shown, colored by structural variant categories: Gain, LOH, Translocation, Duplication, Deletion, and Inversion. Both views are linked interactively with a blue brush, allowing for synchronized exploration across the genome.
