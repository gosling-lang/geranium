The visualization consists of three horizontal bar charts aligned side by side, each displaying genomic data using a multivec file format. The first chart represents data from chromosome 12 in a genomic interval of 5,000,000 to 15,000,000 and is colored green. The second chart represents chromosome 9 within the same interval range and is colored sky blue. The third chart returns to chromosome 12 within the same interval and is colored pink. Each bar's height on the y-axis represents quantitative peak expression values, with bars outlined in white and a stroke width of 0.5. The layout is responsive, adapting to narrower device widths by arranging the charts vertically. The data visualization effectively encodes genomic positions using the x-axis and quantitative expression on the y-axis, ensuring clarity and ease of comparison across different genomic intervals and conditions.
