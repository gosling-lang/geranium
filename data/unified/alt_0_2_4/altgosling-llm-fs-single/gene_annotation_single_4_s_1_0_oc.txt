The visualization depicts a genomic range annotation track in a linear layout titled "GmGDV," covering chromosome 3 from position 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. It features gene annotations differentiated by strand orientation, with "+" strand genes in blue and "-" strand genes in red. The track includes text, triangles, rectangles, and lines to indicate gene names, direction, exons, and gene extents. The layout is arranged horizontally, with elements stacked vertically to distinguish strand categories.
