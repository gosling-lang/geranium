A circular visualization composed of parallel tracks for multiple chromosomes, displaying genomic data and cytogenetic bands. Each track has two layers: an area chart for genomic expression and an ideogram with band annotations.

- **Layout:** Circular, static, and parallel.
- **Chromosomes:** Five tracks represent chromosomes 1 to 5.
- **Data Type:** Multivec file for genomic data and CSV for cytogenetic band data.
- **Area Chart:**
  - **X-Axis:** Genomic position.
  - **Y-Axis:** Expression values.
  - **Color:** Represents different sample categories.
- **Ideogram:**
  - Displays cytogenetic bands in varied colors (e.g., white, gray, black) to indicate density.
  - Additional elements: Purple rectangles and maroon triangles represent centromere bands.
- **Purpose:** To compare genomic expression and structural information across chromosomes in a compact, visually layered format.
