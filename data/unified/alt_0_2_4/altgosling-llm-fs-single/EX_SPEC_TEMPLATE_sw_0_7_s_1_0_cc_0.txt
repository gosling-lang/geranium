A linear visualization composed of three main charts, utilizing Gosling.js track templates. The top chart is a genomic range annotation track focusing on chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000, displaying gene structures with arrows indicating strand direction in gray. Middle chart visualizes sequence data as a bar chart on chromosome 1 between positions 77,925,299 and 77,925,320, highlighting nucleotide bases with colors representing different categories (A, T, G, C). The bottom chart is an ideogram of chromosome 1, conveying banding patterns with distinct colors representing various cytogenetic bands. Each track leverages various mark types such as rectangles and text to enhance interpretability. Title: "Track Template In Gosling.js," Subtitle: "Gosling.js enables track templates!
