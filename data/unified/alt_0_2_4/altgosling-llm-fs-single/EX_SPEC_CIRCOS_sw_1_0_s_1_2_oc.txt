A circular visualization known as 'Circos' demonstrates genomic data. It includes three main tracks: a bar chart, an ideogram, and a connection chart. The bar chart, colored in silver, visualizes quantitative data across the genome on the y-axis. The ideogram displays genomic intervals using rectangles colored by different categories. The connection chart features interrelated genomic positions linked by lines of varying colors, each representing distinct categories. This visualization effectively presents genomic patterns and relationships in a compact, comprehensive circular layout.
