The visualization titled "Gremlin (O'Brien et al. 2010)" presents interconnected genomic data using multiple linked views. In the first view, a linear ideogram of chromosome 5 showcases bands with distinct stain patterns, color-coded to denote categories, with pink and gray tones. The ideogram is coupled with a brush feature allowing interactive selection linking to other charts.

Below the ideogram, two tracks visualize segmental duplications. The first track aligns chromosomes hs5, hs4, and hs6 using rectangles, with rows color-coded in blue, orange, and green based on chromosome annotations. The second track features within-link connections on chromosome hs5, depicted in sky blue arcs, emphasizing overlapping regions and highlighting genomic rearrangements.

The second main view, titled "Region of Interest," zooms into chromosome 5 between 68,000,000 and 71,000,000 base pairs, showing detailed link connections among chromosome segments hs5, hs4, and hs6.

The final view, "Rearrangement View," focuses further on a smaller genomic interval (69,276,000 to 69,280,000) on chromosome 5. It reveals close-up rearrangements with enhanced arc representation connected in sky blue.

Overall, the visualization employs a linear layout with sophisticated link styles and opacity settings to elucidate genomic relationships and rearrangements effectively.
