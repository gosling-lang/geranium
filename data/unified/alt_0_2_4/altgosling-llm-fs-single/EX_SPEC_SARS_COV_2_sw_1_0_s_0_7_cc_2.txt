The visualization titled "SARS-CoV-2" consists of five distinct tracks within a linear layout. The top track, "NC_045512.2 Genes," uses pink rectangles to represent gene regions and includes sky-blue gene symbols. A brush interaction links this track to the detailed view below. The "S Protein Annotation" track, stratified by rows, categorizes proteins such as the receptor-binding domain and cleavage sites, indicated by color-coded rectangles. The "NC_045512.2 Genes" track, within the detailed view, displays navy blue rectangles with gene symbols in black text. The "NC_045512.2 Sequence" track visualizes nucleotide sequence counts with colored bars for bases A, T, G, and C. The "TRS-L-Dependent Recombination Events" track shows genomic connections with green strokes, indicating recombination events. The genome's interval for these analyses is NC_045512.2: 1 to 29,903. The data are curated from sources such as the WashU Virus Genome Browser, NCBI, and GISAID.
