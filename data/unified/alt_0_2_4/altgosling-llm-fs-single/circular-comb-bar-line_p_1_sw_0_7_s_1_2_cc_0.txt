A dual-track circular visualization displays genomic data for chromosome 1 from a multivec file. The left track presents a circular line chart and scatter plot, where lines and points represent expression values stratified by categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each category is color-coded using blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The right track features a circular bar chart, with bars colored similarly to indicate different categories. The tracks depict data for the interval 1 to 3,000,500 bp, encoded by positions and peaks along genomic and quantitative axes, respectively.
