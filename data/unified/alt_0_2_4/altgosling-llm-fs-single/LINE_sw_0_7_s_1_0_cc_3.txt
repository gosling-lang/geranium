A linear line chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying data across the entire genome of hg38. The chart's title is "Basic Marks: line" and the subtitle is "Tutorial Examples." Genomic positions are plotted on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. The lines are colored green, with a consistent size specifying their thickness. The chart covers a width of 560 units and a height of 210 units.
