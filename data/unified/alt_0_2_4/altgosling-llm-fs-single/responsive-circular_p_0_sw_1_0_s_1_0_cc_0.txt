A circular bar chart displays genomic data for chromosome 12, covering the interval from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. This visualization consists of multiple concentric tracks. Each track represents a sample, with the x-axis showing genomic intervals and the y-axis capturing expression values through bars. Categories of the data are color-coded across the samples, using a palette that includes blue, orange, green, red, purple, and brown. The chart is dynamic, adjusting to changes in aspect ratio, and has been designed to emphasize the visibility of important data features at various sizes. The overall presentation is informed by the graphical perception principles discussed in Javed et al., TVCG 2010.
