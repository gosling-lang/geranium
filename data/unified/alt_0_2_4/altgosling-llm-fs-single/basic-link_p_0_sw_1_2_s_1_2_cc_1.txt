The visualization is a linear track chart titled "Basic Marks: Link" with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples." It displays internal connections across the genome for chromosome 1 using a CSV file. The data fields, such as "s1," "e1," "s2," and "e2," represent genomic positions, creating link marks. The connections are shown in a soft purple color, emphasizing genomic intervals. The chart's dimensions are set to a width of 1152 and a height of 216, reflecting a non-static, horizontally oriented layout and using the hg38 genome assembly.
