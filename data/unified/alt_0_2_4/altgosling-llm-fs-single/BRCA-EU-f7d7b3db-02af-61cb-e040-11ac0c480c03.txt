The visualization is composed of a circular and a linear view stacked vertically, displaying genomic data from the hg19 assembly. In the circular view, there are five tracks: an ideogram, a point annotation track, two range annotation tracks, and a link track with connections. The ideogram, featuring a blue interactive brush, allows linking between the views. The point annotation track, titled "Putative Driver," visualizes text annotations. The range annotation tracks, "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," show genomic ranges in blue and orange rectangles, respectively. Lines in the link track represent structural variants like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication,' colored based on the 'svclass' data field. 

The linear view magnifies chromosome 1, aligned with the circular overview. It includes similar tracks such as the ideogram and annotation tracks. Additional tracks in the linear view comprise a gene annotation track, a scatterplot for "Point Mutation," and a range track for "Copy Number Variants." The scatterplot illustrates mutations with points colored by 'SUBTYPE.' The range track displays two rows for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' variations, represented in distinct colors.
