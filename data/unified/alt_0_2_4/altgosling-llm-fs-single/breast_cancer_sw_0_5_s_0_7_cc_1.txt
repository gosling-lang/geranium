The visualization comprises a linear arrangement of five distinct tracks, each providing a unique genomic perspective across chromosome 1. The top track features an ideogram decorated with rectangles and directional triangles, where colors symbolize categorical genomic features, such as bands and centromeres. Below, a genomic position annotation track displays strand information using colored triangles; blue for positive, and orange for negative, both aligned by strand direction. Two subsequent tracks depict copy number variations. The first exhibits sky-blue rectangles for minor CNV occurrences (minor_cn_tumor = 0), whereas the second uses purple rectangles to denote regions with total CNV in primary tumors within specified ranges. The final track visualizes genomic rearrangements via connections between positions, with line colors and strokes distinguishing variant types like tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions.
