The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view, linked by a blue interactive brush. The circular view covers the entire genome, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. In the circular view, a track shows a genomic ideogram, with color-coded rectangles indicating different categories. Below this, a track titled "Putative Driver" displays genomic data as black text. Additional tracks present genomic ranges "Gain" in sky blue and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in dark orange. A line-connection track visualizes structural variations such as Translocations, Duplication, Deletion, and Inversions, differentiated by color and stroke.

The linear view mirrors the circular view's tracks and includes additional features. A scatterplot titled "Point Mutation" shows mutations as colored points along the y-axis, based on their subtype. Gene annotations are visualized, with genes represented by triangles and rectangles, color-coded by strand. A range annotation track displays insertions and deletions with rectangles. Another track, titled "Copy Number Variants," visualizes quantitative data as gray bars. The layout facilitates an interactive exploration of genomic data, supporting a detailed analysis of chromosome 1.
