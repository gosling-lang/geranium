A linear layout visualization features a text-based representation of a multivec file. The x-axis displays genomic intervals, and the y-axis encodes quantitative values labeled as "count." The text mark is used to represent four nucleotide bases: 'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C'. Each base is presented with distinct colorsâ€”blue for 'A', orange for 'T', green for 'G', and red for 'C'. The visualization also includes a title, "Basic Marks: Text," and a subtitle, "Tutorial Examples," showing a dynamic presentation across a specified genomic range. The data is displayed with text overlaying designated genomic intervals, enabling the illustration of base occurrence and distribution within the specified genomic assembly hg38.
