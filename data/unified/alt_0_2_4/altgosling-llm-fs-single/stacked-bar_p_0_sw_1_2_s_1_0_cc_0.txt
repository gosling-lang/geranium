A stacked bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. Four samples named 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4' are displayed, each with distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The height of the bars represents quantitative values from the field 'peak', and the x-axis is labeled with genomic positions. The chart includes gridlines and a legend indicating category colors.
