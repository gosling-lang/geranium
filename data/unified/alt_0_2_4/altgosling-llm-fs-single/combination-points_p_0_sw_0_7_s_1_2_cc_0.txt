A vertical layout featuring two linear scatter plots visualizes multivec data for chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. Each track represents genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis. The top scatter plot is divided into rows by sample categories, each colored distinctlyâ€”blue for "sample 1," orange for "sample 2," green for "sample 3," and red for "sample 4". The size and color of points represent peak values and sample categories, respectively. The second scatter plot on the bottom also illustrates genomic positions and peak values, with points colored by sample categories. Both plots include semi-transparent points with defined opacity, showing interactive information on genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample categories through tooltips.
