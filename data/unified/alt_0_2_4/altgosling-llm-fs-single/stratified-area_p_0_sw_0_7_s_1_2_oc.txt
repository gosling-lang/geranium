The visualization is a layered area chart with a linear arrangement displaying multivec data of chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. It is divided into four stratified rows, each representing a different sample: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. These samples are distinguished by unique colors: yellow, green, blue, and pink, respectively. The genomic positions are plotted on the x-axis, while the quantitative 'peak' values are shown on the y-axis. The chart includes white stroke outlines on each area with a width of 0.5. A legend displays the color assignment for each sample, and tooltips provide interactive data details such as start and end genomic positions and peak values.
