A linear layout visualizes various BED file specifications for chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 2,000,000. There are four tracks presented vertically: the first track, titled "BED12," displays BED data using all 12 standard fields. The second track, "BED6," utilizes only the first 6 BED fields. "BED6+6" represents a combination of the first 6 BED fields with 6 custom fields. Finally, "BED12+1" includes all 12 standard fields alongside an additional custom field. Each track uses black rectangles with outlines to signify genomic regions based on start and end positions. The demonstration highlights different levels of BED file detail and customization.
