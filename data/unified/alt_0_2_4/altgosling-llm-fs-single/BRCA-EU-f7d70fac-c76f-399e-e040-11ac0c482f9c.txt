The visualization consists of two stacked views: a circular layout and a linear layout, linked by an interactive brush. The brush highlights chromosome 1, allowing for cross-view coordination. The circular view features a genomic ideogram, a point annotation track titled "Putative Driver," range annotation tracks for "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and a line-connection track demonstrating structural variants. The linear view showcases an expanded view of chromosome 1, highlighting detailed genomic features. It includes a detailed ideogram, a gene annotation track, a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" which visualizes point mutations with variant types, and additional range annotation tracks. Line connections in both views illustrate structural variations such as translocations, duplications, deletions, and inversions. The colors and layout provide an organized overview of genomic information and structural variations across chromosome 1.
