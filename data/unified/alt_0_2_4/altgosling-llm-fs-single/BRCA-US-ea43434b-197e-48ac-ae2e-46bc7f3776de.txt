A circular and linear genome visualization displays multiple genomic features using the hg19 assembly. The circular view highlights the entire genome with tracks for ideograms, annotation, and structural variations. Key features include "Gain" in sky blue and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in dark orange, shown as rectangles. Connections between genomic positions illustrate structural variations, categorized by color into 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' 'Inversion (TtT),' and 'Inversion (HtH).' The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, with tracks for gene annotations, point mutations from a VCF file, insertions and deletions, copy number variations, and structural variations. An interactive brush links the views, enhancing navigation and comparative analysis.
