A linear layout visualization titled "Custom Mouse Events" showcases multiple interactive bar charts and genomic tracks, leveraging multivec and beddb data. The main tracks include "Individual Marks," "Group Marks By Sample," and "Group Marks By Genomic Position," each displaying genomic data on the x-axis and quantitative peaks on the y-axis. Bar colors vary according to sample categories, providing visual differentiation. An additional track, "Group Marks By Gene," utilizes beddb data, illustrating genomic regions with text, triangles, and rectangles in shades of gray. The final track, "Group Marks By Chromosome," presents cytogenetic band data with labels, rectangles, and triangles color-coded according to density and categorization. Mouse events like hover and range selection enhance interactivity, facilitating responsive user engagement with dynamic color and style changes.
