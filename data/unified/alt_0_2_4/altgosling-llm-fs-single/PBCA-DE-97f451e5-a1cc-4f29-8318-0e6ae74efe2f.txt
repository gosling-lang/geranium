A circular and linear view are arranged vertically. The circular view displays the entire genome with a blue interactive brush linking to the linear view, which shows chromosome 1. The circular view comprises five tracks, including an ideogram, point annotations, range annotations for 'Gain' in blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in red, and a line-connection track. Lines are colored based on 'svclass' categories like 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Duplication,' and 'Inversion.'

The linear view has additional tracks: a gene annotation track, a scatter plot for 'Point Mutation' using a VCF file with points colored by 'SUBTYPE,' and two range annotation tracks. The first displays 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' in yellow and green. The second, titled 'Copy Number Variants,' shows bars representing 'total_cn' values in grey rectangles.
