A multi-row area chart in a circular layout visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. Various samples, categorized into rows, display peak values using colored areas. Each sample, such as 'sample 1', 'sample 2', etc., is represented by a distinct color ranging from blue to cyan. The data is filtered to exclude unspecified samples, ensuring clarity in the visual encoding of quantitative differences.
