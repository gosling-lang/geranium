A multi-row line chart in a circular layout visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The data for six rows, labeled as 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 6', 'sample 7', and 'sample 8', are displayed, with each line colored differently to represent the categories. The genomic intervals are plotted on the x-axis, while the peak values are depicted on the y-axis.
