The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view, linked by an interactive blue brush. The circular view displays the entire genome, specifically highlighting attributes such as 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' using blue and red rectangles, respectively. Lines connecting different genomic positions indicate various structural variations, color-coded by the 'svclass', including 'Translocation', 'Duplication', and 'Deletion'. The linear view showcases chromosome 1 and features multiple tracks, including a gene annotation track, a scatter plot for 'Point Mutation', and additional tracks for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion'. Each point and rectangle in the scatter and range annotations are color-coded to represent different categories, enhancing genomic data comprehension.
