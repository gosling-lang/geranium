The visualization consists of two circular charts arranged horizontally, depicting genomic data from chromosome 1 ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500 on a circular layout. The left chart is a circular bar chart displaying expression levels with bars, where the height and color of each bar represent expression values for categories 'sample 1' through 'sample 4,' colored in blue, orange, green, and red. The right chart combines a circular line chart and a scatter plot, with lines and points representing the same four categories. The size of the points corresponds to expression values, and the charts are stratified by row for each category. Both charts are interactive, featuring tooltips for detailed information.
