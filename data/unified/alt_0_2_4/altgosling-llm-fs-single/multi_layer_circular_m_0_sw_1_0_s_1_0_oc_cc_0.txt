The visualization is a circular scatter plot displaying data from chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. Points represent genomic data, with each point's position on the y-axis indicating quantitative 'peak' values. The chart is organized by rows for different 'sample' categories, each distinguished by unique colors. The inner rings represent lower 'peak' values, transitioning to higher values in the outer rings, with opacity variations highlighting different value domains. This visualization is based on multivec data, showcasing 16 samples, omitting any labeled "sample -", and provides a visually stratified representation of genomic expression data.
