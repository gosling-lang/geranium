The visualization is a circular bar chart displaying genomic data for chromosome 12, spanning from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000 base pairs. Each concentric circle represents a different sample, as categorized in the multivec data, excluding 'sample -'. The bars are color-coded to distinguish between various samples, and they depict quantitative expression levels (called 'peak') along the y-axis without a labeled axis. Opacity varies across different domains of 'peak' values, highlighting subtle changes within those ranges. This circular layout facilitates the simultaneous view of multiple samples on a single genomic interval, enhancing comparative analyses based on combined data insights. The visualization is linked to a specific study by Javed et al. on graphical perception of multiple time series, indicating its application in temporal data analysis contexts.
