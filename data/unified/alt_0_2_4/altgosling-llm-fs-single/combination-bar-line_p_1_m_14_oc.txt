The visualization is a linear layout featuring two vertical tracks that display genomic data for chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is an overlay of an area chart and scatter plot, visualizing multivec data across four samples, with the genomic position on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis. Categories are differentiated by color, and the area chart highlights trends for each sample in distinct layers. The second track is a scatter plot with points sized by peak values, providing another view of the data with distinct colors representing different samples. Tooltip interactions reveal genomic positions, peak values, and sample identities.
