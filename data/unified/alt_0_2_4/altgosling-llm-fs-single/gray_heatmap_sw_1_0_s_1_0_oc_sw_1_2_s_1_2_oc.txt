A heat map in a linear layout visualizes a matrix file, showing the entire genome of hg38. Both x and y axes represent genomic intervals, with color intensity encoding the quantitative values. The matrix cells are depicted in shades of grey, where variations in intensity indicate different expression levels. The visualization's width is 606 and height is 510 pixels, with a static presentation and genomic axes labeled on the top and left.
