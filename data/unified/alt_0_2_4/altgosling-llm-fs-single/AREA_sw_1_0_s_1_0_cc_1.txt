A linear layout visualization displays an area chart representing a multivec file for the entire genome of hg38. The x-axis uses genomic positions, while the y-axis shows quantitative values named 'peak,' displaying the expression values. The blue-colored area in the chart indicates these values across the genome. The visualization is titled 'Basic Marks: area' with the subtitle 'Tutorial Examples.'
