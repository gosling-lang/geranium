The visualization is a linear layout illustrating insertions and deletions from a VCF file across multiple chromosomes. The data is stratified into two rows labeled 'Insertion' and 'Deletion,' with each category represented by a different color: orange for insertions and green for deletions. Genomic positions are denoted along the x-axis from chromosome 1 to chromosome X. Each event is shown as a rectangle, with a tooltip providing additional genomic details such as the position, reference, alternate alleles, and quality score. The background is light gray for clarity.
