The visualization is a linear genomic range annotation view featuring multiple tracks across the chromosome 3 interval from 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. It includes six individual charts in two vertical arrangements, titled 'HiGlass,' 'Corces et al.,' 'IGV,' 'Cyverse-QUBES,' 'GmGDV,' and an unnamed track. Each chart shows genomic annotations with text labels for genes, using different colors and shapes to represent the gene strand direction and type (gene, exon, or intron). The tracks are stratified by rows for the categories, represented by colors like blue, red, navy, gray, and purple. For example, right triangles and rules in blue represent the '+' strand, whereas left triangles and rules in red depict the '-' strand. Rectangles and texts further annotate exons, genes, and introns. Each chartâ€™s title corresponds to its respective data source, illustrating the diversity of genomic information and styles used to depict genomic features.
