The visualization showcases a comprehensive genomic analysis comparing two views: circular and linear, covering the human genome (hg19). The circular view highlights genome-wide features using tracks such as an ideogram, a putative driver annotation, gain and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) tracks colored in sky blue and orange respectively, and structural variations (SV) with a within-link track illustrating connections based on SV classifications such as duplication and translocation. A blue interactive brush in the ideogram allows users to select and link specific genome regions to the linear view, enhancing navigability.

In the linear view, focusing on chromosome 1, the ideogram visually maps genomic regions with marks indicating chromosome bands. The linear projection provides a detailed, horizontal layout for tracks. These include a putative driver annotation as a text track; a 'Point Mutation' scatter plot displaying variant types such as C>A mutations, highlighted with color-coded points; a range annotation track displaying 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' events; and a gray-colored 'Copy Number Variants' track that visually quantifies copy number changes. Additionally, gain and LOH tracks reinforce the data highlighted in the circular view, with the within-link track illustrating complex SV connections in various color hues to represent inversion and other genomic phenomena. The structured arrangement supports interactive exploration, with mouse events enhancing data discovery by providing additional SV details through tooltips.
