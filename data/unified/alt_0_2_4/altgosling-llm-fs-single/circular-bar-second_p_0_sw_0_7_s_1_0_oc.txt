This visualization is a circular bar chart showcasing genomic data in a circular layout, focusing on chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The chart features four rows, each corresponding to different samples named 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The genomic position is mapped onto the x-axis, while quantitative values related to peak expression are mapped onto the y-axis. Each sample is represented by bars in distinct colorsâ€”yellow, green, blue, and pink. Interactive tooltips provide additional information, such as start and end positions, peak value, and sample identity. The chart allows for easy comparison of genomic expression across the different samples in a compact circular format.
