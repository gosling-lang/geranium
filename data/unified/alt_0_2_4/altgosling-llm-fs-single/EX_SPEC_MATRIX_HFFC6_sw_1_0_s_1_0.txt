The image showcases a horizontal arrangement of visualizations comparing Micro-C and Hi-C data for HFFc6 cells, focusing on chromosome 7 from 77,700,000 to 81,000,000. 

There are two main sections:

1. **Left Vertical Section:**
   - Three vertical bar charts represent different genomic tracks:
     - **HFFc6_H3K4me3:** In dark green.
     - **HFFc6_ATAC:** In orange.
     - **HFFC6_CTCF:** In blue.
   - Additionally, right-facing (pink) and left-facing (green) triangles indicate genomic position annotations at different strands.

2. **Right Horizontal Section:**
   - Two vertical arrangements of tracks:
     - Each arrangement contains bar charts similar to the left section, but oriented horizontally. 
     - Each includes:
       - **HFFc6_H3K4me3** and **HFFc6_ATAC** tracks.
       - An **Epilogos (hg38)** chart, visualizing multiple chromatin states such as Active TSS, Enhancers, and Repressed regions, using multicolor bars.
     - **HFFc6_Micro-C** and **HFFc6_Hi-C** matrix plots display contact intensities in warm color ranges, showing genomic interactions across two axes.

These visualizations are embedded within a light gray background, enhancing the contrast for detailed genomic analysis and providing insights
