The visualization is a linear layout showcasing genomic connection data from a CSV file. It features arcs representing links between genomic positions. The x-axis displays genomic intervals for chromosome 1, with arcs connecting start and end positions. The arcs are styled in light red. The visualization has a title "Basic Marks: Link" and a subtitle "Tutorial Examples." The data maps genomic fields 's1', 'e1', 's2', and 'e2', indicating start and end positions for each link, contributing to the visual connections between positions on the chromosome.
