Two vertically arranged scatter plots display genomic data for chromosome 1, covering the interval from 1 to 3,000,500. The top scatter plot stratifies the data by samples, showing expression values through the size and position of the points, colored distinctly for each sample. The bottom plot presents similar data with gridlines, adding further detail. Categories are 'sample 1' (blue), 'sample 2' (orange), 'sample 3' (green), and 'sample 4' (red). The opacity of points is set at 0.5. The charts are interactive, providing genomic and quantitative tooltips for each point.
