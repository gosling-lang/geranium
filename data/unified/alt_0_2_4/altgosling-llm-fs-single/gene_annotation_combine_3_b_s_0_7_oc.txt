The visualization presents a linear genomic range annotation focusing on chromosome 3, highlighting regions between 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. It consists of three horizontally arranged views: "HiGlass," "IGV," and "Corces et al."

1. **HiGlass View**: Displays gene annotations with directional markers and text labels. Blue triangles and lines represent the '+' strand, while red triangles and lines depict the '-' strand. Gene exons are shown as rectangles. This track is stratified by strand rows.

2. **IGV View**: Shows gene annotations similarly but in a predominantly navy color scheme. Text labels and rectangles denote gene positions with indiscernible strand orientation, while white patterned lines indicate directional information.

3. **Corces et al. View**: Features finer-resolution gene annotations. It uses text and smaller rectangles for genes, colored by strandâ€”blue for '+', red for '-'. Exons are rendered as separate larger rectangles, and lines connect genomic start and end points.

Each view is overlaid to offer multiple perspectives within the same genomic interval, enhancing comparative genomic analysis.
