The visualization is a linear genomic annotation track titled "Corces et al." It covers the region of chromosome 3 from 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. The visualization includes gene annotations displayed with text and rectangles. The genes on the positive strand are shown in blue, while those on the negative strand are in orange. Exons are represented with larger rectangles, and a rule spans the gene range, linking exons with a connecting line. Text labels indicate gene names for easy identification.
