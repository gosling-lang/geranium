A stacked bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, displaying data from chromosome 12 between the positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart features multiple categories shown in distinct colors for each sample, indicating genomic peaks. The bars are stratified by samples, enabling comparison. Additionally, it includes visibility thresholds to adjust the opacity of bars: higher values for bars are more opaque, facilitating highlights for key variations. The chart is titled "Graphical perception of Multiple Time Series" referencing Javed et al., TVCG 2010.
