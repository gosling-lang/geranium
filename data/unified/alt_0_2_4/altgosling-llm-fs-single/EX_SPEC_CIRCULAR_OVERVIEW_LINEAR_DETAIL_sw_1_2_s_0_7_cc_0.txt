The visualization consists of a circular and linear layout showcasing genomic data through multivec and CSV file formats. The circular chart displays a bar arrangement for four samples across chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 14, and 16, with connections highlighting rearrangements between these chromosomes. Categories are color-coded: sample 1 (blue), sample 2 (orange), sample 3 (green), and sample 4 (red). The linear views underneath extend details with separate bar charts for chromosomes 5 and 16, linked interactively by brushes to the circular chart. This detailed arrangement allows analysis of genomic positions and associated expression values per sample.
