A linear visualization with a vertical arrangement displays multivec data across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track features an overlay of area and point marks stratified by rows, representing four samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4'). Peaks are quantified on the y-axis, with their size also indicating peak value. Color coding distinguishes each sample, and a color legend is present. The bottom track showcases an area chart revealing expression patterns with stacked areas, similarly categorized and colored by samples. The charts are interactive, offering tooltips for genomic position, peak value, and sample category. This representation is meant for genomic data exploration using an hg38 assembly reference.
