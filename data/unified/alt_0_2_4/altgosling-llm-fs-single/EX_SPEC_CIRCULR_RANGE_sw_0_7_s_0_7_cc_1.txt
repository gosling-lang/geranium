A circular bar chart visualizes a vector file, illustrating genomic data from the hg38 assembly. The chart displays quantitative expression values ('peak') as bar heights arranged around the circle, with genomic positions ('position') on the x-axis. The bars are colored in sky blue. The layout is static and aligned in a stacked configuration, with a central radius of 0.3. The chart provides an overview of expression levels across different genomic regions, conveying data intensity through bar height.
