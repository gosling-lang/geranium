The linear layout visualization displays genomic data from chromosome 1, within intervals ranging from 1 to 3,000,500. The first view shows an overlay of four samples represented as area charts. Each sample ('sample 1' in blue, 'sample 2' in orange, 'sample 3' in green, and 'sample 4' in red) is stratified into rows and distinguished by color. The genomic position is on the x-axis, and the peak values are on the y-axis and size axis. The second view is a bar chart, displaying the same samples with bars colored similarly to the area chart, indicating different categories. Both charts provide tooltips for genomic positions, peak values, and sample identifiers.
