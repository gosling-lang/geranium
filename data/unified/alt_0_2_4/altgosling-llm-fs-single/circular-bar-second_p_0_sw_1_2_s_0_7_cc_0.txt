A circular bar chart with a vertical arrangement visualizes a multivec file displaying data from chromosome 1 ranging from 1 to 3,000,500. The chart is stratified by rows into four categories, labeled 'sample 1' through 'sample 4,' represented by different bar colorsâ€”blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. Each track encodes genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis, with a detailed tooltip accessible for additional data points. The layout is static with a center radius of 0.5, showing a clear color legend.
