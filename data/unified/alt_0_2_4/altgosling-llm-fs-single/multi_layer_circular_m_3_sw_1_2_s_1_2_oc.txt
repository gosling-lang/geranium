A circular bar chart in a circular layout visualizes a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The visualization includes 16 different samples, displayed in concentric rings. Each sample is represented by a unique color, with the peaks of expression visualized as bars. The bars are segmented based on quantitative values with varying transparency levels, and the chart is structured into multiple tracks for better clarity. The interactive design allows differentiation of samples by opacity and categorization by color, contributing to an intuitive display of genomic data trends.
