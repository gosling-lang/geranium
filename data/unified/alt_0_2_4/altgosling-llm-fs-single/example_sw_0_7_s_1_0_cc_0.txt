A visualization depicting various encoding methods within a linear layout, featuring nine different tracks. The title "Visual Encoding" and subtitle "Gosling provides diverse visual encoding methods" introduce the visualization. The first track is a heat map displaying genomic intervals on the x-axis with color intensity indicating expression values, stratified by sample categories. Subsequent tracks include bar charts and scatter plots, each showing genomic positions on the x-axis with expression levels on the y-axis, categorized by sample with distinct colors. Additional tracks present line charts and area plots, enriched with points of varying sizes. The final track connects genomic positions with lines, displaying categorical variations through color and opacity.
