A circular scatter plot visualizes a multivec file, displaying chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. Data points represent genomic positions and expression values along the x and y axes, respectively. Four categories ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4') are shown using different colors. Each point's size is proportional to its expression value. Tooltips provide details such as genomic position, sample, and expression value. The visualization uses a semi-opaque style with a center radius of 0.5.
