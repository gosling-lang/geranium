The visualization displays a matrix comparing Micro-C and Hi-C data for HFFc6 cells, focused on chromosome 7 from positions 77,700,000 to 81,000,000. It includes two horizontal arrangements of views, each with multiple tracks.

The first section contains vertically arranged bar charts showing peak data from bigWig files, colored in dark green for HFFc6_H3K4me3 and orange for HFFc6_ATAC. An overlay contains blue bars for HFFC6_CTCF, along with pink and green genomic position annotations indicating strand directions.

The second section presents matrix tracks for Micro-C and Hi-C data, depicting genomic intervals on both axes. Expression values are encoded using a heatmap color intensity. Below these matrices, the Epilogos (hg38) track displays categories using various colors.

Overall, this visualization structure provides a comprehensive comparison between different genomic interaction data types, enriched by color-coded categorical annotations.
