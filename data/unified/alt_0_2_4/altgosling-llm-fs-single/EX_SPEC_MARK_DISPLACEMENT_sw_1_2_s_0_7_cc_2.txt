The visualization titled "Mark Displacement" displays genomic data with a focus on addressing visual overlaps using displacement. It consists of three main sections. 

1. **Transcript Track (Top Section):** 
   - Displays transcripts on chromosome 3 within intervals from 142,500,000 to 143,000,000. 
   - Uses right and left triangles to indicate strand directionality for positive and negative strands.
   - Rectangles depict exons, while text labels show gene names.
   - A maximum of 15 rows are used for displacement.

2. **Likely Benign Variants Track (Middle Section):**
   - Focuses on chromosome 2 between 126,800,000 and 127,700,000.
   - Displays likely benign variants as points with labeled nucleotide changes (A, T, G, C).
   - Connection lines between points visualize genomic relationships.
   - Uses different colors and text for categorical data and annotations.

3. **Pathogenic Variants Track (Bottom Section):**
   - Centers on chromosome 17 in the interval from 43,080,000 to 43,120,000.
   - Shows pathogenic significance using stacked points, categorized by a color legend.
   - Displacement is applied to prevent overlap, ensuring clear visualization.

The entire visualization demonstrates the transcription and variant annotation using visual encodings such as color, shape, and position, across linear genomic tracks in a horizontal layout.
