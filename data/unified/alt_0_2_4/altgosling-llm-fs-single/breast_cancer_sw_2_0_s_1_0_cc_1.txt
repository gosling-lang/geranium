A linear visualization displays the genome of chromosome 1 from the Hg38 assembly. It consists of five stacked tracks. The top track is an ideogram using color-coded rectangles and triangles to denote different cytogenetic bands. This is followed by a gene annotation track, where gene direction is shown using blue triangles for the positive strand and orange triangles for the negative strand. Two consecutive tracks show segmented genomic regions as purple rectangles, depicting copy number variants from a cancer study, filtering out specific minor and total copy number values. Finally, the bottom track uses color-coded connections to represent different structural variations like "tandem-duplications," "translocations," "deletions," and "inversions" according to the 'svclass' field, thus illustrating intricate rearrangements in chromosome 1.
