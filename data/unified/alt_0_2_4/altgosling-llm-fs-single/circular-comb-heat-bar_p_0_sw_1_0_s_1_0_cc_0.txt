A circular visualization features two main tracks. The left track is a heat map displaying genomic intervals along chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. Color intensity indicates expression values, with the chart stratified by rows according to four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4.' The right track is a bar chart, also circular, using the same genomic interval on the x-axis. The y-axis encodes expression with bars, each category represented by different colors: blue for 'sample 1', orange for 'sample 2', green for 'sample 3', and red for 'sample 4.' Both tracks include tooltips displaying start and end positions, expression values, and sample names, utilizing data from a multivec file.
