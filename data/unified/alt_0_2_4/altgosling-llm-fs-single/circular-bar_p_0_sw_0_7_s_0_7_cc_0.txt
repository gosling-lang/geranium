The circular bar chart visualization represents data from a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 1, between positions 1 and 3,000,500. It is arranged in a vertical format with a center radius of 0.5, highlighting two categories, 'sample 1' and 'sample 2.' These are displayed using bars, stratified by rows, with a range of colors including blue and orange for differentiation. The y-axis utilizes minimum and maximum expression values, indicated by the 'peak_min' and 'peak_max' fields. A tooltip provides additional details such as genomic position and sample information. The chart has a black stroke with a width of 0.2, ensuring clear visibility of the data.
