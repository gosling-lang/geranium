The visualization is a linear area chart that displays genomic data across the entire hg38 genome assembly. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis shows quantitative expression values. The chart, titled "Basic Marks: area," is subtitled "Tutorial Examples" and uses a multivec file. A single sample category is depicted using an area mark. The area is filled with a solid color, and the size is set to a constant value of 2. The width of the chart is set to 1152 pixels, and the height is 216 pixels. The x-axis features genomic positions, whereas the y-axis uses a quantitative scale.
