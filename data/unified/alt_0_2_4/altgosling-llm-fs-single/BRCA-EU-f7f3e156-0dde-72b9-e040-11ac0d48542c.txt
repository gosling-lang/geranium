The visualization presents a circular and linear view linked through an interactive brush in the circular view. It covers the entire genome, with chromosome 1 highlighted in the linear section. The circular view includes tracks such as an ideogram and point annotation, with 'Gain' ranges in blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange. Lines between genomic positions are color-coded based on categories like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.'

The linear view features nine tracks, expanding upon the circular representation with additional elements. A scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation' displays mutations, color-coded by subtype, while range annotations visualize 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' in yellow and green. 'Copy Number Variants' are represented with light grey bars, each reflecting quantitative data. This complex visualization effectively combines circular and linear genomic representations, offering a detailed overview of genomic variations.
