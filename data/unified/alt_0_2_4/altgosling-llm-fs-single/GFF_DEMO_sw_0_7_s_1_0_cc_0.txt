The linear visualization, titled "GFF3 file," displays a section of the E. coli genome, ranging from positions 222,000 to 240,000 on the chromosome U00096.3. This genomic data is illustrated using a GFF3 file. Genes are encoded as horizontal segments with their names labeled above each segment. Arrows at the ends of the segments indicate gene direction and are colored according to gene biotype: protein-coding, tRNA, rRNA, ncRNA, pseudogene, and unknown. The design ensures clarity with lines connecting genomic intervals and directional arrows, providing an informative representation of genome structure and gene distribution.
