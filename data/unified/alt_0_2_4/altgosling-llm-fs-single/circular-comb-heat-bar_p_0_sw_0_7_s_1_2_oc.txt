A visualization in a circular layout, showing genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The layout consists of two tracks arranged vertically. The left track is a circular heat map representing expression values with color intensity, stratified by sample categories. The right track is a circular bar chart where expression values are shown with bars, also stratified by sample categories, each represented by different colors. Data is sourced from a multivec file, highlighting genomic positions and peak values across four sample categories. The layout's center radius is 0.5, with measurement ranges adjusted to this interval.
