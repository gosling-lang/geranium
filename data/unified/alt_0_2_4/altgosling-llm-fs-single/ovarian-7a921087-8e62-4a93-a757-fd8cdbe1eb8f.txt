A circular and linear genomic visualization is displayed, organized in a vertical layout. The circular view represents the entire genome in an ideogram with interactive features, showcasing regions of chromosome 1 with a blue brush. It includes tracks for 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' displayed in blue and orange rectangles, and a connection track with lines colored by structural variants such as 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.' The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, featuring multiple tracks: a detailed ideogram, putative driver annotations, gene annotations, scattered points for mutations based on a VCF file, and range annotations for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion.' Quantitative copy number variants are shown as gray bars, and the visualization is enriched with extensive color coding and categorical representation to detail genomic data.
