The visualization is a linear genomic representation of chromosome 1, featuring five individual tracks. The top track displays an ideogram with colored bands indicating different chromosomal features. Left and right triangles are included to represent specific regions, colored according to categories like "gneg," "gpos25," and others within the domain. Below, a genomic position annotation track stratified by strand orientation uses blue and orange triangles to signify gene directions. The next two tracks highlight genomic ranges with rectangles, where pink represents regions of "minor_cn_tumor" data filtered to zero values, and sky blue indicates regions within specified "total_cn_tumor" ranges. The final track uses curved connections to illustrate structural variants, with lines colored and stroked based on the "svclass" categories, such as "tandem-duplication" and "translocation," using a monochromatic scale for differentiation. This layout facilitates the exploration of chromosomal data and structural variations.
