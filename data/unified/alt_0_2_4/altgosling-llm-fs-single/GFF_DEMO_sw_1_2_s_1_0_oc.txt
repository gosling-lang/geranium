The visualization is a linear track depicting the E. coli genome, specifically the region between 222,000 and 240,000 on chromosome U00096.3. It uses components of a GFF3 file to show genomic features colored by gene type, including protein-coding genes, tRNA, rRNA, ncRNA, pseudogenes, and unknown categories. The chart is aligned in an overlay arrangement and implements various marks: right triangles to indicate the end of a gene on the positive strand, left triangles for the negative strand, text labels for gene names, and rules to represent gene locations, styled with line patterns. The color scheme includes orange, blue, green, red, purple, and black to depict different gene biotypes. The layout is smooth, and features are stratified by strand. Each gene type is shown with specific marks and colors, enhancing gene categorization visually on the genomic axis. The visualization features high opacity, providing clear distinctions between gene types.
