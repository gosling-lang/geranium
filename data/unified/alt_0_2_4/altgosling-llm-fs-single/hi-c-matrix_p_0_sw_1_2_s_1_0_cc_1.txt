A visual representation of a Hi-C matrix displays genomic interactions using a combination of bars, rules, and points across chromosomes 5 to 10. The overlay includes multiple tracks: a matrix with color intensity indicating quantitative values, sky-blue vertical and horizontal rules marking specific genomic positions, categorical bars with varying stroke colors, and green points whose size reflects values from the genomic data. The matrix spans intervals from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 on both axes, with a dashed styling effect applied. This chart provides a comprehensive view of data from the hg38 assembly, linking to additional insights through detailed genomic annotations.
