A circular line chart and scatter plot arranged vertically visualize a multivec file with samples 1 through 4, showing chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The lines represent quantitative expression data with points overlaid to denote height, using varying sizes. Each sample is displayed in different colors: blue for sample 1, orange for sample 2, green for sample 3, and red for sample 4. The chart is stratified by rows per sample, and a legend indicates the sample categories. The interactive design facilitates tooltip information on genomic position, peak value, and sample name.
