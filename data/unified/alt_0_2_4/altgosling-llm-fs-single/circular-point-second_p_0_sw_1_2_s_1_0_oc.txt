A circular scatter plot in a vertical arrangement visualizes a multivec file, illustrating genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The plot uses point marks to represent expression values, where the position along the x-axis corresponds to genomic positions, and the y-axis reflects the expression peaks. The size and opacity of the points are also determined by the expression values. Points are distinctly colored according to four categories labeled 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4,' with the colors being yellow, green, blue, and purple, respectively. A tooltip provides additional information about each point, enhancing interactive data exploration.
