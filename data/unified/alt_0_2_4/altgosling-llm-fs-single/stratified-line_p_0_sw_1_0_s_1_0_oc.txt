The visualization is a multi-row line and point chart in a linear layout, showing data from a multivec file visualized across chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. Each row represents a sample, namely 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', with data points connected by lines, colored in distinct hues. The height and size of the points are determined by the 'peak' value. The x-axis illustrates genomic positions, while the y-axis denotes quantitative peak values. Data tooltips provide genomic positions, peak values, and sample identifiers. The chart's design is completed with a categorical color legend allowing easy sample identification.
