The visualization presents the SARS-CoV-2 genome in a linear layout using data sourced from the WashU Virus Genome Browser, NCBI, and GISAID. It includes several tracks depicting various genomic features across the NC_045512.2 reference assembly.

1. **Gene Track**: Displays genes from the NC_045512.2 genome using pink rectangles. Genes are annotated with green lines and text labels, providing their genomic positions. A blue interactive brush facilitates zoom linkages to expand specific regions.

2. **S Protein Annotation Track**: Annotates protein regions such as receptor-binding domain (RBD), receptor-binding motif (RBM), and cleavage sites. It uses colorful rectangles to differentiate these regions and labels them with black text.

3. **Sequence Track**: Features a bar chart that shows sequence data based on nucleotide counts (A, T, G, C) represented by bars. The bars are color-coded to indicate nucleotide type.

4. **Link Track**: Visualizes TRS-L-dependent recombination events with arcs connecting different genomic locations, colored in sky blue to denote linkage paths.

The chart is richly detailed with colors denoting specific features, and interactivity to enhance data exploration.
