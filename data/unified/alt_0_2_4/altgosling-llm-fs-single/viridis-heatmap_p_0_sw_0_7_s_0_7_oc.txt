The visualization is a heat map in a linear layout, displaying genomic intervals on the x-axis from chromosome 1, positions 1 to 3,000,500. The data is a multivec file representing four samples, each aligned in separate rows. The color intensity encodes the quantitative 'peak' values, with a color gradient depicted on a legend indicating values between 0 and 0.001. Each sample is stratified by row, and interactive tooltips provide genomic position start and end, peak value, and sample identifier.
