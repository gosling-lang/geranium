A linear visualization depicts multivec data across chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The chart features four tracks stratified by 'sample,' each represented by different colorsâ€”blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis is genomic, displaying chromosome positions, while the y-axis is quantitative for peak values. Lines represent trends, with points indicating peak sizes proportional to expression levels. An interactive legend allows color-based identification of samples. The layout is vertical, with an overlay alignment integrating lines and points. Tooltip support enhances data exploration, providing detailed positional and quantitative information for each sample.
