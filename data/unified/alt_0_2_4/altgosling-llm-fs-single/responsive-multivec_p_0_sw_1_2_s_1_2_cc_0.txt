The visualization presents a bar chart in a linear layout, displaying a multivec file across chromosome 12, intervals ranging from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. Each row represents a sample, with categories such as 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', etc., up to 'sample 16'. The peaks of the bars indicate quantitative expression values, color-coded for each category in vibrant hues like blue, orange, green, and red. This dynamic chart adjusts its height responsively. The reference for this visualization is Javed et al., highlighting graphical perception of multiple time series as discussed in TVCG 2010.
