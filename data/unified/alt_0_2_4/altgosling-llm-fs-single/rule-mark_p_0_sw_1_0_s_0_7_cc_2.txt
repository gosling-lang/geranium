The visualization is a linear bar chart overlaid with horizontal and vertical rule marks. The x-axis presents genomic intervals, while the y-axis displays peak expression values. Purple bars represent data from a multivec file, highlighting expression levels. Overlaid on the chart are dashed sky-blue horizontal lines and vertical lines at specific genomic positions on chromosomes 2, 5, and 10. The stroke width of the rules corresponds to the quantitative values specified in the dataset. The chart's title is "Rule Mark," and it is subtitled "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines," emphasizing its function to highlight specific genomic positions.
