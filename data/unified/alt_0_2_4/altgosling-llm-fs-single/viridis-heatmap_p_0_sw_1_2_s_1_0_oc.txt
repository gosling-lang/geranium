The visualization illustrates a linear heatmap displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning an interval between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The multivec data is represented using colored rectangles, where the color intensity indicates the expression level, with a range from low (purple) to high (yellow). The heatmap comprises four rows categorized by 'sample 1' through 'sample 4.' Each rectangle's horizontal position correlates with genomic positions, and the intensity of the color encodes the 'peak' values. Genomic coordinates are annotated along the x-axis, providing a reference scale. A color legend is included on the right, aiding in the quantitative interpretation of the peak values. The heatmap is configured in a vertical arrangement within a single track, designed using the human genome assembly hg38 and represents data with a bin size of 4.
