A circular and linear genomic visualization displays integrated data analysis using HG19 reference assembly. The circular ideogram provides an overview of chromosomes with links indicating structural variations. The tracks show 'Putative Driver' genes, copy number variations titled 'Gain' in sky blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in dark orange. Connections show various genomic events like 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion', colored to distinctively represent each event. The linear section, linked by an interactive brush, focuses on chromosome 1 with detailed views for annotations and mutations. The point mutation scatterplot visualizes distances to previous mutations, with data points colored by mutation subtype. Additional tracks depict insertions and deletions with rectangles, and bar tracks represent quantitative data on copy number variations, all stratified by categories.
