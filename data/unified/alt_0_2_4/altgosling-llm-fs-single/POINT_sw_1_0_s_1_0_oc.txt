The visualization depicts a scatter plot in a linear layout, visualizing genomic data from a multivec file across the entire hg38 genome assembly. It uses a point mark to represent data points, where positions are plotted along a genomic x-axis labeled with chromosomes, and peak values are encoded on the y-axis. The size of the points is also determined by the peak values, providing an additional layer of quantitative detail. The plot is titled "Basic Marks: point" with a subtitle "Tutorial Examples." It visually conveys data attributes with orange-hued points. The layout dimensions are 800 pixels wide and 210 pixels high, and the chart is not static, allowing for potential interactions such as zooming, enabled by a zoom limit setting.
