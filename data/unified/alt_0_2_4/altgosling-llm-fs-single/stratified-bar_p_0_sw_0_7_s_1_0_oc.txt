The visualization is a multi-row bar chart in a linear layout that displays data from a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The chart features four distinct rows, each corresponding to categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is depicted by a different color, enhancing the visual distinction. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis shows quantitative values of the 'peak' field. The tooltip provides additional details, such as start and end positions, sample names, and peak values. The chart is interactive, with a top axis for easy reference.
