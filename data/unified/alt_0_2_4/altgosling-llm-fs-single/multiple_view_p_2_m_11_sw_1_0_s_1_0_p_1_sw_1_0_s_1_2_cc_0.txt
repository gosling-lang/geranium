**Description**: 

The visualization is titled "Visual Linking" with the subtitle "Change the position and range of brushes to update the detail view on the bottom". This interactive visualization consists of a scatter plot, an area chart, and a circular line chart. 

1. **Scatter Plot**: 
   - Arranged in a linear layout with an x-axis showing the genomic positions on chromosome 1, ranging from 160,000,000 to 200,000,000.
   - The y-axis represents quantitative expression values, depicted as points. 
   - The data is stratified by four categories labeled 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', with distinct colors (blue, orange, green, and red).

2. **Area Chart**: 
   - Organized horizontally, with the same genomic intervals on the x-axis.
   - It visualizes the expression data as filled areas, with colors corresponding to different samples. 
   - An interactive brush allows users to select specific data sections for detailed exploration.

3. **Circular Line Chart**: 
   - The genome data is displayed in a circular format, maintaining the chromosomal intervals.
   - Line connections represent the expression data, colored analogously to the scatter plot.

The charts are linked, allowing dynamic updates to the detailed view at the bottom based on user interactions with the brushes. The genomic data is sourced from a multivec file, emphasizing the expression peaks
