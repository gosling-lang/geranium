The visualization consists of a stacked circular layout with multivec bar charts and genomic connection lines, alongside linear views linked by interactive brushes. The circular layout includes multivec file data, which stratifies rows by 'sample 1' to 'sample 4,' colored in blue, orange, green, and red. The connection lines between genomic positions are differentiated by stroke categories, such as 'deletion,' 'inversion,' 'translocation,' and 'tandem-duplication,' with a sky blue color indicating these connections. Below the circular view, two linear bar charts show details for chromosomes 5 and 16, respectively, each stratified by sample categories outlined in corresponding colors. These charts provide zoomed-in views enabled by linking brushes. The visualization employs a chromosomal layout and bar marks to depict quantitative data on the y-axis, efficiently linking larger genomic contexts with specific chromosomal details.
