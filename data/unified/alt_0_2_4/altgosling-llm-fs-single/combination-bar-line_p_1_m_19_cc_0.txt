The visualization comprises two layered charts arranged vertically. The top chart features a line and scatter plot, displaying genomic positions on the x-axis and expression levels on the y-axis. It is divided into four rows, each corresponding to a sample category, with lines and points colored differently for 'sample 1' (blue), 'sample 2' (orange), 'sample 3' (green), and 'sample 4' (red). Point size reflects expression magnitude. The bottom chart is a bar chart representing the same genomic regions and samples, using bar height and color to indicate expression levels and sample categories. The x-axis ranges from 1 to 3,000,500 on chromosome 1.
