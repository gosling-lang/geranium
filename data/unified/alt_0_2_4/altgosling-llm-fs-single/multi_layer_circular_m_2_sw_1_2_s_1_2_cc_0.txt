The visualization is a circular area chart depicting a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. It represents the genomic data using stratified area layers for 16 different samples (except those labeled 'sample -'). Each sample is given a distinct color, ranging from blue and orange to green, red, and more, across the circular layout. The height of the area represents the 'peak' values, divided into domains of [0, 0.01], [0, 0.0025], [0.0025, 0.005], [0.005, 0.0075], and [0.0075, 0.01], with varying opacities for differentiation. This chart enables the visual comparison of expression levels across samples within the specified genomic interval.
