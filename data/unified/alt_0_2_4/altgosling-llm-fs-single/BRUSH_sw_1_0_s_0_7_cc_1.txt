A linear layout visualization titled "Example: Brushing and Linking" consists of two tracks, each displaying a genomic line chart of chromosome 1. The top track uses purple lines to show "peak" values, featuring an interactive brush for zooming. The brush highlights a section, linking to the second chart. On the bottom track, within the brushed region of 200,000,000 to 220,000,000 base pairs, red lines illustrate detailed "peak" values. The integration of brushing and linking enhances interactive data exploration.
