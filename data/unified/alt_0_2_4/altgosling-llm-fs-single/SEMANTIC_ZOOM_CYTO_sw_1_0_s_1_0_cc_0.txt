The visualization titled "Example: Semantic Zooming" presents an ideogram of the human genome using a linear layout. It employs a semantic zooming feature where text and triangle marks become visible upon zooming in, providing more detailed information. 

The primary data source is a CSV file containing genomic data, which is visually represented using a series of rectangle and triangle marks. Rectangles highlight different chromosomal bands, each colored according to the respective chromosome. The visualization distinguishes stains using a color range from black for high-density regions to white for low-density ones, with specific colors for genetic variations. 

When the zoom level surpasses a certain threshold, text labels appear, indicating the names of individual chromosome bands. Maroon-colored triangles denote the centromeric regions ('acen') with a marker for both arms of the chromosomes. The values and details adapt dynamically to the zoom level, showcasing additional insights as users explore specific regions. 

The plot spans the entire width of 800 pixels with a height of 55 pixels, maintaining a consistent gray outline styled with a stroke width of 0.5. This interactive design enhances the user's understanding by incrementally revealing more genomic details upon closer inspection.
