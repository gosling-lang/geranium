A linear layout showcases four genomic tracks using BED files from the Ensembl genome assembly hg38. Each track displays genomic intervals as black rectangles across chromosome 1, from position 1 to 2,000,000, providing different specifications of BED files. The BED12 track includes all standard fields presented as black rectangles. The BED6 track uses the first six fields, showing genomic intervals similarly. The BED6+6 track, using the first six standard fields along with six custom ones, portrays intervals from the seventh and eighth columns. Lastly, the BED12+1 track, combining all standard fields with an additional custom field, displays intervals using standard positions. The title "BED files" and subtitle "Demonstration of using BED files of different specifications" describe this genomic visualization.
