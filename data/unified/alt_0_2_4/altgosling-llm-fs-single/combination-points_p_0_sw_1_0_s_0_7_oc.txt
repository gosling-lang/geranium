A linear visualization with two vertically arranged tracks presents genomic data across chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track displays a stratified scatter plot with points representing expression values from four samples: 'sample 1' (yellow), 'sample 2' (blue), 'sample 3' (pink), and 'sample 4' (green). The x-axis depicts genomic positions, while the y-axis and point size encode quantitative peak values. The bottom track includes another scatter plot, showcasing sample-specific points with the same color scheme. The layout supports interactive exploration, featuring tooltip annotations and a grid in the bottom track. This visualization effectively conveys variations and patterns in expression across the genomic region specified.
