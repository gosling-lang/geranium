A vertically arranged visualization consists of two tracks in a linear layout, showing the genomic data of chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is an area chart with four rows representing categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'. Each area's color corresponds to its category, using shades of blue, orange, green, and red. The bottom track is a scatter plot displaying points sized and positioned based on 'peak' values. The point colors represent the same categories, maintaining the consistent color scheme. The entire view is interactive, with tooltips providing detailed genomic positions and peak values.
