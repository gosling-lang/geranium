The visualization showcases a linear arrangement of four tracks, each representing different BED file specifications for chromosome 1, spanning the interval from 1 to 2,000,000. Each track is visualized as a series of rectangles along the x-axis, indicating genomic intervals. The first track, titled 'BED12: All 12 standard fields,' features purple rectangles, visualizing data from a BED file with 12 standard fields. The second track, 'BED6: A file with the first 6 BED fields,' similarly uses purple rectangles to display data from a BED6 file. The third track, 'BED6+6: A file with the first 6 BED fields, and 6 custom fields,' also visualizes with purple rectangles, but utilizes custom fields for genomic positioning. Lastly, the fourth track, 'BED12+1: A file with all 12 standard fields, and a single extra custom field,' displays in sky blue, illustrating the BED12+1 file format. The consistent stroke and size for rectangles across all tracks enhance comparability. The visualization aids in understanding the application of different BED file specifications by visualizing variations in genomic intervals within the chromosome.
