The visualization is a responsive stacked bar chart in a linear layout, displaying genomic data for chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. It features multiple rows representing different samples, colored distinctly for each category. The height of bars reflects quantitative expression values. Data is dynamically filtered to exclude certain samples, and visibility toggles alter opacity based on track height. The chart is part of a study on graphical perception of multiple time series.
