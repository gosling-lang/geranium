A circular visualization displays multivec data for chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. This chart includes both lines and points to represent quantitative genomic data ('peak'). Data is stratified across four categories ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'), with each category depicted in distinct colors. Lines illustrate continuous data trends, while points denote specific data points whose sizes correlate with expression values. The layout is vertical within a circular format, using a center radius of 0.5 to organize this data for visualization.
