A linear layout presenting four BED file variations over chromosome 1 from position 1 to 2,000,000. Each track uses rectangles to represent genomic intervals. The first track, titled "BED12: All 12 standard fields," features sky blue rectangles. The second track, "BED6: A file with the first 6 BED fields," displays pink rectangles. The third track, "BED6+6: A file with the first 6 BED fields, and 6 custom fields," shows sky blue rectangles based on custom fields. The final track, "BED12+1: A file with all 12 standard fields, and a single extra custom field," again uses sky blue rectangles. All tracks are outlined in black.
