A linear visualization in a horizontal layout depicts genomic data on chromosome 2, using hg38 assembly. It consists of two tracks: a line chart and an area chart. The line chart shows three samples ('sample 1', 'sample 3', 'sample 4'), each represented by different line colors (blue, orange, green). The area chart displays two samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2'), also color-coded (blue and orange). Both tracks use a nominal color encoding based on sample categories, and the expression values are plotted on the y-axis. The genomes are aligned along the x-axis. Each track has a stroke styled as white, with a width of 0.5.
