This visualization displays five linear views arranged serially, each representing individual chromosomes from chr1 to chr5. Each view consists of two tracks: an area plot and an ideogram with annotations.

1. **Area Plot:**
   - **Data Source:** Multivec file containing genomic information.
   - **X-axis:** Genomic positions along each chromosome.
   - **Y-axis:** Quantitative peaks representing expression levels.
   - **Color Encoding:** Different categories within the data are shown in diverse colors.

2. **Ideogram and Annotations:**
   - **Data Source:** CSV file with cytogenetic band information.
   - **Displays:** Chromosomal bands with annotations such as text, rectangles, and triangles.
   - **Visual Elements:** 
     - Rectangles are used to indicate density values, varying from white to black.
     - Text annotations label each band.
     - Triangles highlight specific bands (acen-1 and acen-2) in maroon.
   - **Color Coding:** Band density and categorical information are visually distinguished using color.

The visualization is static and organized in a linear layout with additional styling features to enhance clarity, such as defined stroke widths and grid lines. The genomic views efficiently overlay data across different tracks, allowing for a comprehensive comparative analysis of chromosomal regions.
