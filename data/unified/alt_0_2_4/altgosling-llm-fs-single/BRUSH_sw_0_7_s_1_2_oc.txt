This visualization comprises two line charts in a linear layout, representing genomic data from chromosome 1. The upper chart allows interactive exploration with a brushing mechanism for selecting specific genomic regions, which links to the lower chart. The data is encoded from a multivec file, showing 'peak' values on the y-axis. The brushing effect highlights the selected region in blue, enhancing interactivity. The background of the second chart is displayed with a semi-transparent blue to indicate the brushed area, aiding in precise navigation and data analysis. The overall visualization is titled "Example: Brushing and Linking" and is set within the hg38 assembly.
