A vertical bar chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from 1 to 3,000,500. The chart features four rows, each representing a different sample (sample 1, sample 2, sample 3, sample 4) distinguished by color. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis encodes quantitative values of peaks. The chart includes interactive tooltips to show details about start and end positions, peak values, and sample identifiers. The layout supports zooming, enhancing the exploration of genomic intervals.
