A genomic visualization in a linear layout displays two distinct chromosomes: chromosome 12 and chromosome 8. Each chromosome is represented with an overlapping genomic range annotation track and several bar charts. The track on chromosome 12 showcases gene annotations with pink triangle and line markers, indicating the gene orientation, along with exon rectangles. The color pink is consistent across text annotations and rules. Below this track, bar charts visualize expression data for samples 1 to 3 with data encoded by different colors; sky blue for sample 1, pink for sample 2, and sky blue for sample 3.

On chromosome 8, another set of bar charts represents expression data similarly, with the first and third samples in pink and the second in purple. The genomic annotation track on chromosome 8 highlights gene names and orientations with purple symbols. The layout facilitates comparative genomic analysis across different samples and intervals, with the linking IDs ensuring interactive exploration between genomic positions on the tracks.
