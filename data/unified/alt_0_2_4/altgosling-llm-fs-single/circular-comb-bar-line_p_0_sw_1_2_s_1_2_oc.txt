The visualization consists of two circular tracks. The left track is a circular bar chart showing genomic data from chromosome 1 with a range of 1 to 3,000,500. Each bar represents expression values (field: 'peak') stratified by four categories (samples 1 to 4) indicated by different colors. The right track is an overlay chart combining a circular line chart and a scatter plot. The line chart visualizes the continuous expression data across the genome, while the scatter plot demonstrates specific data points where the point size depicts the magnitude of expression values. Categories are shown using color in both lines and points. The layout is static, and a radial configuration provides an informative overview of genomic features.
