The visualization presents a linear layout of genomic data for chromosome 1, focusing on the region between 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. The visualization includes seven tracks, utilizing rectangle and between-link marks to depict genomic intervals and connections. The first and third rectangle tracks display intervals with pink and green colors, respectively, while the fifth and seventh tracks use pink and purple colors for alternate segments. The between-link marks, in purple and pink, illustrate connections between intervals across the tracks. The data is sourced from a CSV file, containing fields for genomic start and end positions. The visualization, with a horizontal orientation and linear arrangement, employs transparent coloring (opacity 0.15) and outlines for clarity. The interactive aspect is minimal, focusing primarily on presenting the genomic structure and adjacency within the specified chromosome interval.
