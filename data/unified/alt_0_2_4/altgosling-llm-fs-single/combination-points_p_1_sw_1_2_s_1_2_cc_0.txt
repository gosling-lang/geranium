The visualization is a linear, vertically arranged layout, focusing on chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. It consists of two scatter plots. The top plot displays genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative 'peak' values on the y-axis, represented by points whose size and color reflect different samples (sample 1 to sample 4), with colors like blue, orange, green, and red. The bottom plot also shows 'peak' values for the same genomic range, but stratified by sample categories in separate rows, maintaining the same color scheme. Both tracks have an interactive tooltip providing genomic range and peak value details, with a semi-transparent appearance due to an opacity setting of 0.5.
