The visualization consists of two circular scatter plots arranged side by side, depicting genomic data from samples 1 to 4. Both plots display the genome of chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 on the x-axis. In both plots, expression values are represented by the position and size of points on the y and size axes. Each point's color corresponds to different samples, facilitating categorical distinction. The left plot shows points in a single circular track, while the right plot stratifies points by sample in four concentric circular tracks. Overall, this layout visually encodes quantitative genomic data, allowing quick comparisons across samples.
