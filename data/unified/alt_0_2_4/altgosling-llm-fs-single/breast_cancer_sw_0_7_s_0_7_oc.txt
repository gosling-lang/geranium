The visualization is a series of genomic tracks arranged in a linear layout, focused on chromosome 1. The top track is an ideogram depicting chromosome 1, showing band patterns with color-coded categories including white, light gray, gray, black, blue, and red. Below, a gene annotation track uses triangles to indicate gene direction based on strand: right-facing for positive and left-facing for negative strands, colored in blue-gray and light brown respectively. Two subsequent tracks display copy number variations in tumors, with orange rectangles representing regions with zero copies, and green rectangles highlighting areas with high total copy numbers. The bottom track features a line-connection plot visualizing structural variants, with arcs connecting genomic positions. These arcs are colored to reflect structural variation classes: tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions, using shades of green, blue, red, and orange.
