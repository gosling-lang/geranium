A vertical bar chart displays genomic data from a multivec file, visualizing chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 in a linear layout. The data is categorized into four rows labeled 'sample 1' through 'sample 4.' Each row showcases a range of expression values on the y-axis, represented by colored bars. The colors correspond to each sample and include orange, green, blue, and purple. The x-axis displays the genomic intervals, while the y and ye-axes denote the minimum and maximum peak values. The chart provides an interactive tooltip detailing the position, minimum and maximum values, and the sample name. Additionally, a slight black outline enhances the visibility of the bars.
