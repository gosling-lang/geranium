A scatter plot in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, displaying data for chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500 in the hg38 assembly. Each point represents the 'peak' value, with size proportional to the value. Points are colored based on four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The layout is vertical, and the opacity of points is set to 0.5. The plot includes a tooltip showing the start and end genomic positions, peak value, and sample category.
