A scatter plot in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. Each point represents genomic data from four samples, with the position along the x-axis indicating the genomic position and the y-axis representing the peak values. The size of the points is proportional to the peak values, and different colors distinguish the samples. The opacity of the points is set to 0.5, and a legend displays the sample categories. The chart includes a tooltip providing detailed information for each point, such as start and end genomic positions, peak value, and sample category.
