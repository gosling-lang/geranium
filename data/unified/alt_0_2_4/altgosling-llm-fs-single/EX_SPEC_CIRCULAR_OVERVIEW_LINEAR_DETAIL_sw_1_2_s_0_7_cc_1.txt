The visualization comprises a vertical arrangement featuring a circular view and two horizontal bar charts. The circular view displays a multivec file with four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4.' These categories are shown with unique colors such as blue, orange, green, and red. The genome is represented in intervals along the x-axis, and expression values are depicted by bars on the y-axis. The view also includes connections representing genomic links, colored sky blue, indicating different categories like 'deletion', 'inversion', 'translocation', and 'tandem-duplication.'

Beneath the circular view are two interconnected horizontal bar charts. Each chart focuses on specific chromosomes, chr5 and chr16, linked to brush selections in the circular view. These charts present the same categories, allowing detailed exploration of genomic intervals and expression through colored bars. The background of the first chart is flagged with blue, and the second with red, emphasizing their interactive linkage to the circular view.
