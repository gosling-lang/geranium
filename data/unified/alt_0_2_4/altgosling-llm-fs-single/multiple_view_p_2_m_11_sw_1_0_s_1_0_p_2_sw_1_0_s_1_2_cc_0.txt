A visualization titled "Visual Linking" presents genomic data in a two-part layout: a circular line chart and a linear area chart above a detailed scatter plot. The circular line chart displays data for chromosome 1, with four samples (blue, orange, green, red) represented in separate rows, each colored accordingly. The linear area chart, aligned horizontally, mirrors this view with area plots. Both charts feature interactive brushes, linking them to a detailed linear scatter plot below. This plot focuses on chromosome 1, within the interval of 160,000,000 to 200,000,000, showing sample expressions as colored points on a genomic axis. This design allows interactive exploration by adjusting the brush positions and ranges, dynamically updating the detail view. The subtitle "Change the position and range of brushes to update the detail view on the bottom" guides the user on interacting with the visualization.
