A circular and linear genomic visualization depicts complex data from the hg19 assembly. The circular view showcases the entire genome with tracks including an ideogram, annotated points, and range annotations titled 'Gain' (blue) and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' (orange). A link track displays connections between genomic positions in various structural variation categories, marked by color and stroke style. The linear view, linked by a blue brush, focuses on chromosome 1, illustrating a detailed ideogram, point mutations in a scatter plot highlighting mutation subtypes, and range annotations for insertions, deletions, and copy number variants. This dual layout efficiently encapsulates comprehensive genomic data for complex analysis.
