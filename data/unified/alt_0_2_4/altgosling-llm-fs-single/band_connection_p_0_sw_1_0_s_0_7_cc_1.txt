The visualization is a horizontal linear layout focused on chromosome 1, spanning from 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. It features seven distinct tracks, alternating between rectangles and between-links. Rectangles are filled with various colors representing genomic intervals: pink, purple, and green. Opposite ends of each rectangle are connected by “between links” colored in corresponding shades, highlighting relationships between genomic regions. Light opacity enhances visualization of overlapping areas. Tooltip features provide genomic start and end positions, ensuring detailed genomic mapping.
