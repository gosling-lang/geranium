The visualization is a linear genomic range annotation chart representing chromosome 3, spanning from 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. It is structured horizontally and shows genomic features stratified by strand orientation. The chart visualizes genes as gray rectangles, exons as red rectangles, and introns as light blue rectangles. Each type of genomic region is differentiated by color, facilitating the identification of gene structures across the specified genomic interval.
