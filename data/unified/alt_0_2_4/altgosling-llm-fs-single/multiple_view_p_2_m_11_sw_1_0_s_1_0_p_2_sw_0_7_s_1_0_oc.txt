The visualization titled "Visual Linking" features a circular line chart and a linear area chart arranged horizontally at the top, and a detailed linear scatter plot at the bottom. The charts use multivec data to display genomic information across chromosome 1. The circular chart has a brush tool linking it to the detailed view, allowing interaction to update the bottom chart. Each chart is stratified by rows and colored by sample categories. The title and subtitle indicate the interactive nature of the visualization.
