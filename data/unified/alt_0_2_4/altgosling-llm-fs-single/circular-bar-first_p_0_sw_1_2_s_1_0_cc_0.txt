A circular bar chart in a vertical arrangement visualizes a multivec file for chromosome 1, from base 1 to 3,000,500. The bars represent quantitative values of peaks for four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The radial layout presents data in a continuous circle. Bar colors are blue, orange, green, and red, indicating different samples. A legend explains the sample-color correspondence. The x-axis is genomic position, while the y-axis displays peak values with gridlines for guidance. The chart links these visual components to a comprehensive, sample-specific insight into genomic data.
