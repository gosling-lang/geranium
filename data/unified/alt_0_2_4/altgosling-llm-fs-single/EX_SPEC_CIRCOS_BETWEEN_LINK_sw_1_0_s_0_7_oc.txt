The visualization is a circular layout titled "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements." It consists of four tracks, including a circular bar chart, two circular ideograms, and a circular chart with connections. The genome is displayed in intervals on the x-axis across all charts. The bar chart shows expression levels on the y-axis with light gray bars. The ideograms use color-coded rectangles to indicate different categories based on the "Stain" field. The circular chart with connections illustrates links between genomic positions, with black lines representing connections on chromosome "hs1" and light gray lines for others. The layout is static, spaced closely with a center radius of 0.3 and is aligned in a stacked manner. The entire layout is oriented horizontally and processed using the human genome assembly hg38.
