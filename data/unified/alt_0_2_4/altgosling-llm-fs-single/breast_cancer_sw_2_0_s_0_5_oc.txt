A linear visualization displays chromosome 1 using various tracks on the hg38 assembly. The ideogram at the top highlights cytobands with distinct color categories. Below, a genomic position track showcases gene annotations, with triangles indicating strand orientation in two rows colored differently. A cancer-related track shows copy number variations using orange and green rectangles to represent different conditions, including loss and gain in tumor cells. The final track represents structural variants with lines connecting genomic positions, using colors to denote different types like tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions. Each track is richly detailed, enhancing the comprehensive genomic view.
