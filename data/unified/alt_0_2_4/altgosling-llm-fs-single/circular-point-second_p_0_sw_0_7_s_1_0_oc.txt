The visualization is a circular scatter plot displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. Points are plotted using genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Point sizes represent quantitative expression values, and colors indicate different samples, with categories labeled 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The layout features a vertical arrangement within a circular format and includes interactive tooltips providing start and end positions, value, and sample information. The transparency of points is set to 50% opacity, enhancing visibility across overlapping data points, while a legend is included to distinguish between sample categories.
