The visualization consists of a combination of circular and linear views highlighting genomic data. At the top, a circular ideogram displays the entire human genome (hg19), with different categories of features marked by color-coded rectangles. Notable tracks within the circular view include a "Putative Driver" text track and two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)." These tracks depict genomic ranges using blue and orange rectangles, respectively. Connections between genomic positions are visualized through lines in various colors to denote different types of structural variations (SV), such as Translocations, Duplications, and Deletions.

Below, the linear view provides a detailed focus on chromosome 1, mirroring the circular view by showing ideograms, text annotations for putative drivers, a scatterplot of point mutations, and range annotations for insertions and deletions. The scatterplot quantifies the distance to the previous mutation, with points color-coded based on mutation subtype. The linear section also includes a track for Copy Number Variants (CNVs), represented as bars whose color intensity relates to the total copy number.

An innovative blue brush in the circular view allows interaction, linking to the corresponding section in the linear view, enhancing exploration and data analysis.
