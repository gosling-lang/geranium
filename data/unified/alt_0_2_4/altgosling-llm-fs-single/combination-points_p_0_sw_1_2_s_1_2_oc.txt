The visualization consists of two linear scatter plots arranged vertically, displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. Each chart, associated with the hg38 genome assembly, uses points to represent expression values, with the x-axis showcasing genomic positions. The y-axis and point sizes symbolize 'peak' values, while colors and row stratification indicate different sample categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The top track segregates samples into distinct rows, whereas the bottom track overlays all samples, facilitating comparative analysis of expression values. Points are semi-transparent to enhance visibility where data points converge. Tooltips deliver additional genomic and quantitative details. The layout is interactive and responsive, supporting zoom and tooltips for detailed exploration.
