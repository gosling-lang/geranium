The visualization is a linear alignment chart focusing on a genomic interval from position 350 to 396, with zoom capabilities extending from position 1 to 396. It comprises two main views. The first view contains three individual tracks: a 'Gap' bar chart displaying gap frequencies in sky blue, a 'Conservation' bar chart showing conservation levels with a hot color gradient, and an overlay alignment chart. The overlay consists of rectangles and text, depicting bases with distinct colors for different categories and black text for annotations. The second view presents an overlay layout comprising rectangles colored by base categories, two bar charts for 'Gap' and 'Conservation,' and a genomic range brush in light blue to link both views. The visualization employs JSON and CSV data sources to encode genomic data, providing an interactive exploration of sequence alignments with nominal and quantitative scales, emphasized by careful use of color and layout.
