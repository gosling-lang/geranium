The visualization consists of three bar charts arranged horizontally, each representing genomic data from chromosomes 12 and 9. Each chart displays genomic intervals on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis using bars. The color of these bars is a light purple, with white outlines to enhance visibility. The genomic data is sourced from a multivec file for "sample 1," focusing on specific intervals of chromosomes where each interval is binned to enhance clarity. The layout is defined to transition to a vertical arrangement when the width is less than 1200, ensuring responsive adjustment. The charts are linked by a common identifier, facilitating interactive exploration across the shared genomic regions.
