The visualization is a genomic range annotation track titled "Cyverse-QUBES," displayed in a linear layout. It represents genomic positions on chromosome 3, specifically from 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. The chart includes multiple visual encodings: text annotations in sky blue for gene names, green right triangles for genes on the positive strand, and sky blue left triangles for genes on the negative strand. Pink rectangles and lines denote genes, with purple rectangles representing exons, outlined in a darker shade. The chart is stratified by rows depicting strand orientation.
