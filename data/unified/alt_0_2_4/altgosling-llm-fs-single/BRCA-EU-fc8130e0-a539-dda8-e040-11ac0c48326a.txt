The visualization comprises a circular and linear view arranged vertically. A blue interactive brush links the circular view, showing the entire genome, to the linear view detailing chromosome 1. The circular view includes an ideogram, a text track, two range annotation tracks for copy number variations labeled 'Gain' in blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange, and a line-connection track displaying various structural variations. The linear view elaborates on chromosome details with ideograms, point and range annotations, including 'Putative Driver' annotations shown in black text. A scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' uses colored points to represent different mutation subtypes. Another range track titled 'Copy Number Variants' displays quantitative variations, using light gray rectangles for visual emphasis.
