A Gosling visualization with a linear layout and vertical arrangement displaying genomic data from chromosome 1 between 1 and 3,000,500. The top track features a heat map depicting expression values through color intensity, organized by categories ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4') represented in separate rows. The color ranges from light to dark brown indicating different expression levels. The bottom track presents a multi-row bar chart showcasing the same samples, where the height of bars indicates expression levels and colors differentiate sample categories, using shades of blue, orange, green, and red. The top axes of both tracks display genomic positions. The data is sourced from a multivec file and visualized using both heat map and bar chart marks.
