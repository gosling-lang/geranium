A linear arrangement of four vertically aligned genomic tracks visualizes the data for chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The first track is a bar chart, displaying genomic intervals on the x-axis while showing values in four categories—'sample 1' through 'sample 4'—with color-coded bars, stratified by rows and encoded by height between the y and ye-axes. The scatter plot in the second track places genome positions on the x-axis and shows quantitative values via point size and color, corresponding to sample categories. The third track features a heat map, where color intensity between genomic intervals on the x-axis represents expression values. The final track overlays a line chart and scatter plot, presenting connected line segments with overlaid points across the genome's x-axis. Lines and points in this plot are colored according to sample categories, adding a dimensional layer through stratification by rows.
