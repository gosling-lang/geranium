The visualization consists of two vertically stacked tracks displaying genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The top track features a scatter plot, where points represent expression levels across samples and are colored by sample identity, allowing for comparison between different samples within the genomic intervals. The bottom track is a line chart overlayed with a secondary line thickness encoding, showing continuous expression trends stratified by sample categories. The data is derived from a multivec file, with tooltips providing genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample information. This dual-track layout effectively captures the variability and patterns in genomic expression.
