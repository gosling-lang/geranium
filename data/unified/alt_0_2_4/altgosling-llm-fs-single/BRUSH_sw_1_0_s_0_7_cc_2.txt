A linear layout visualization comprises two line charts displaying genomic data from chromosome 1. The top chart shows genomic positions with pink lines, spanning the full range of chromosome 1 with a brush interaction highlighting a specific region in steel blue. The bottom chart, titled "Example: Brushing and Linking," zooms into the same highlighted region with purple lines against a light blue background. The visualization is crafted using a multivec data file, where the y-axis represents quantitative 'peak' values, and the x-axis shows genomic positions. The linking brush effectively connects the two views, enabling interactive exploration of specific genomic intervals.
