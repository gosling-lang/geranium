The visualization is a circular layout called "Circos," showing genomic data. It includes three main tracks: a bar chart representing genomic data with peaks using a silver color, an ideogram for chromosome visualization with color-coded categories, and a connection track displaying links between genomic positions in various colors based on categories. This configuration highlights genomic positioning and relationships using a vector and CSV data files, showcasing peaks, categories, and connections with a Circos method for comprehensive genomic visualization.
