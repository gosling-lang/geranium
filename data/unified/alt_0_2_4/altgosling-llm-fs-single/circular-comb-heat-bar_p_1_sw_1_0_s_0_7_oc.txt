A circular visualization layout illustrates genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The visualization comprises two horizontal views.

**Left view:**  
- Displays a circular bar chart with tracks stratified by four samples: "sample 1," "sample 2," "sample 3," and "sample 4."
- Each sample is represented by distinct colors, and the bars encode quantitative genomic values in the y-dimension.
- The x-dimension depicts genomic positions along the top axis.
- Tooltip provides genomic positions and peak values.

**Right view:**  
- Features a circular heatmap encoding expression values as color intensities.
- Samples are stratified in rows with genomic positions linked along the top axis.
- Color intensity varies to denote different quantitative genomic values.
- Tooltip supports interactive exploration by displaying genomic positions, peak values, and sample information.

The visualization employs a multivec data source rendered in a static, circular format, using "hg38" genomic assembly, with emphasis on categories and sample details for interpretive clarity.
