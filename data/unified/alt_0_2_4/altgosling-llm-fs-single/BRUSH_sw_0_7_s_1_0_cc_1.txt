A two-track linear visualization demonstrates brushing and linking of genomic data from chromosome 1 (chr1) using a multivec file. The top track is a line chart showing the entire chromosome, with expression levels depicted along the y-axis and colored in purple. A brush tool in steel blue is applied, allowing interaction. The bottom track, titled "Example: Brushing and Linking," focuses on a specific region of chr1, between intervals 200,000,000 and 220,000,000, displaying the data in pink. The visualization highlights linked genomic regions with interactive focus, enhancing data exploration.
