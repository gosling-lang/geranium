A composite visualization features two circular charts arranged horizontally. The left chart is a heat map, displaying genomic intervals as color intensities, representing expression values across four samples. Each sample is assigned to different rows, with color intensity encoding the peaks. The right chart is a circular bar chart, also stratified by rows for the same four samples. It represents genomic intervals on the x-axis, with expression values shown by the height of bars on the y-axis, colored distinctly for each sample. Both charts encompass data from chromosome 1 ranging from 1 to 3,000,500.
