The visualization is a circular scatter plot showing genomic intervals from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000 on chromosome 12. Multiple samples are represented by rows, with each point indicating expression levels identified by the data field "peak." Points are color-coded to represent different samples, and the chart is divided into several concentric circles. The color of the points provides a nominal scale without a legend, enhancing the visual distinction across samples. This chart references the work of Javed et al. on the graphical perception of multiple time series.
