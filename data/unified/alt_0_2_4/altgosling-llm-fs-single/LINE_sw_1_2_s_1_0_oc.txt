The visualization is a line chart in a linear layout, depicting genomic data using a multivec file. It covers the entire genome of hg38. The x-axis represents the genomic position, while the y-axis shows quantitative expression values derived from the "peak" field. The lines' thickness is uniform, set to a size of 2. The chart is titled "Basic Marks: line" with a subtitle "Tutorial Examples." The visual encoding primarily involves lines without additional color coding.
