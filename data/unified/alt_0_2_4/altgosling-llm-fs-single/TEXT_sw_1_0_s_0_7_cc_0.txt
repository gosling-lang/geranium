A linear text chart titled 'Basic Marks: Text' displays genomic data across intervals. The x-axis represents genome positions, while the y-axis shows quantitative expression values using text labels. Different nucleotide bases—A, T, G, and C—are indicated by varying colors: blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. Categories are shown by the text's color, providing a visual distribution of genomic data along the assembly hg38. The layout is horizontal, maintaining uniform scaling without a stroke around the text.
