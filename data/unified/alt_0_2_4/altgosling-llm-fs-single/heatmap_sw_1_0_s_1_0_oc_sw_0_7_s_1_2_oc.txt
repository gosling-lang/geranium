A heat map titled "HFFc6_Micro-C" presents matrix data within the human genome (hg38). The visualization is configured in a linear horizontal layout. Both the x-axis and y-axis represent genomic intervals without specific axis annotations. The rectangles within the heat map use a "warm" color range to encode quantitative expression values, with variations in color intensity indicating different expression levels. The visualization is static and non-interactive, with dimensions of 504 by 720 pixels. The heat map provides insights into genomic data, highlighting regions based on their expression values.
