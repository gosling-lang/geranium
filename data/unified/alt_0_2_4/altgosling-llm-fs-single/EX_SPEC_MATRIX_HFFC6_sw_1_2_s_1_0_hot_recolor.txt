This visualization comprises 19 individual charts, organized in a horizontal arrangement to compare Micro-C and Hi-C for chromosome 7 (interval 77,700,000 to 81,000,000) in HFFc6 cells. The top tracks feature genomic data from bigWig files visualized as bar charts, indicating chromatin features such as H3K4me3 (purple), ATAC-seq (dark green), and CTCF binding (orange). Annotation tracks overlay these with triangle marks (pink for right, green for left) representing gene directionality. The matrix tracks illustrate contact density for Micro-C and Hi-C, using color intensity from a 'hot' range to represent interaction strength. At the bottom, the Epilogos track shows chromatin states using multicolored bars, each color indicating specific chromatin features, such as TSS, enhancers, and heterochromatin regions. The title and subtitle provide context for the comparison being visualized.
