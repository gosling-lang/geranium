The visualization features a circular view and a linear view arranged vertically, linked by a blue interactive brush in the circular view. The circular view, titled 'Ideogram,' visualizes the entire genome of hg19, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. The circular view includes a point annotation track titled 'Putative Driver', two titled range annotation tracks 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' showing genomic ranges in blue and orange rectangles respectively, and a line-connection track visualizing structural variations such as 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversions.' These categories are indicated by the different colors and strokes of the lines. The linear view includes additional tracks such as a gene annotation track, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' visualizing distances to previous mutations with color-coded points representing mutation subtypes, and a range annotation track for Copy Number Variants displayed in gray.
