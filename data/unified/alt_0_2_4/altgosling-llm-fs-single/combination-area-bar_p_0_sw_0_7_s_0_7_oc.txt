A linear visualization displays genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. The first chart uses an area plot to depict expression values with four categories distinguished by color: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each category is plotted across separate rows, and the areas are stroked in white. The second chart features a bar plot with genomic intervals on the x-axis and the minimum and maximum expression values on the y-axis. Categories are again represented by color and stratified by rows. Tooltips provide detailed information, such as start and end positions, peak values, and sample names. The layout is vertical with a center radius of 0.8, presented in a linear style.
