A pair of circular scatter plots visualize genomic data for chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500 on the hg38 assembly. The locations of genomic features are represented along the circular x-axes. Each plot shows expression values using points, with sizes varying based on the 'peak' field's quantitative data. The points are colored according to 'sample' categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', with corresponding colors for visual distinction. The left plot does not have grid lines while the right plot features them, aiding in the visual separation of quantitative values on the y-axis. Both plots share consistent sizing and opacity settings for points, aimed at effectively illustrating the genomic distribution and comparative expression levels across the sampled categories.
