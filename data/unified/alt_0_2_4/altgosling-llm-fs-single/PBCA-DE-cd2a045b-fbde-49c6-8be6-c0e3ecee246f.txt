A comprehensive genomic visualization combines a circular and a linear layout to represent chromosome data. The circular layout features an ideogram with colored bands to denote different staining regions, along with tracks for "Gain" in blue and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in orange. Connecting lines indicate structural variations including translocations, duplications, deletions, and inversions.

The linear layout, linked to chromosome 1, includes multiple tracks: an ideogram, a "Putative Driver" track indicating specific gene positions, a scatter plot labeled "Point Mutation" displaying mutations with varying distances to previous mutations, and additional tracks for insertions, deletions, and copy number variations (CNVs). The CNVs are shown in gray, representing quantitative variations. This dual view effectively highlights genomic alterations across different structural categories.
