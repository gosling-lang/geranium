The heat map is displayed using a linear layout in a static configuration, visualizing a genomic matrix from the entire hg38 assembly. Both the x- and y-axes represent genomic intervals, specifically from chromosome 1 at position 0 to chromosome Y at 57,227,415. The intensity of the heatmap colors signifies the quantitative values within the data, with a "hot" color scheme applied. The visualization dimensions are 226 pixels in width and 310 pixels in height, offering a detailed representation of the genomic relationships across the specified axis intervals.
