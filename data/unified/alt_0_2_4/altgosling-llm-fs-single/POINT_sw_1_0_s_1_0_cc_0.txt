The visualization is a scatter plot in a linear layout, representing a multivec file across the entire genome of hg38. Each point's position and size are determined by the data field named 'peak,' with pink coloring for the points. The chart is titled 'Basic Marks: point' with the subtitle 'Tutorial Examples.' The genomic positions are displayed on the x-axis, and the peak values are shown on the y-axis, providing a comprehensive view of expression data across different genomic positions.
