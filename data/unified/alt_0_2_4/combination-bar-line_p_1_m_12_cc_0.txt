Figure with two charts. Top track is a bar chart and scatter plot.  The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars and points. The height of the expression values is shown with the size-axis. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the bars and points.   Bottom track is a scatter plot.  The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with points. The color of the points indicates the different categories.
