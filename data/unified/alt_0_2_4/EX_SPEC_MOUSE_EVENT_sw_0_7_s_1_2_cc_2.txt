Figure with 5 individual charts. Briefly, these are 3 different bar charts, a genomic range annotation track with text and a ideogram and chart with text, rectangles and left and right triangles.Bar chart. Chart is titled 'Individual Marks'. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The color of the bars indicates the different categories.  Bar chart. Chart is titled 'Group Marks By Sample'. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The color of the bars indicates the different categories.  Bar chart. Chart is titled 'Group Marks By Genomic Position'. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The color of the bars indicates the different categories.  Genomic range annotation track with text. Chart is titled 'Group Marks By Gene'.
