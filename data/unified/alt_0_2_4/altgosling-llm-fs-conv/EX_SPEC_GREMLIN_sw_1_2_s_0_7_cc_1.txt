A genomic visualization titled "Gremlin (O'Brien et al. 2010)" displays Chromosome 5 of the human genome (hg38) using a linear layout. The ideogram chart highlights chromosome bands using colors to represent different staining patterns. It includes textual annotations and an interactive brush for linking views. Below the ideogram, three additional charts visualize genomic rearrangements with links. The first is color-coded according to chromosome categories, showing connections across Chromosomes 4, 5, and 6 in blue and green. The "Region of Interest" chart narrows the focus to specific genomic intervals, and the "Rearrangement View" emphasizes a smaller segment of Chromosome 5, demonstrating connections in green. The visualization employs elliptical links and uses rows to categorize data points.
