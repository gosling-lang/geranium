Figure with 5 individual charts. Briefly, these are a ideogram and chart with left and right triangles, a genomic position annotation track, 2 different charts with rectangles and a chart with connections.Ideogram and chart with left and right triangles. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The color of the rectangles, right triangles and left triangles indicates the different categories.  Genomic position annotation track. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The genome is shown on the x-axis.  The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the right triangles and left triangles.  Chart with rectangles. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.   The color of the rectangles is sky blue. Chart with rectangles. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.   The color of the rectangles is green. Chart with connections. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The categories are shown with the color and stroke of the connections.
