Figure with 4 individual charts. Briefly, these are a circular bar chart, a circular chart with connections and 2 different bar charts.Circular bar chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the bars.  The x and y-axes have brushes, linking to the other charts. Circular chart with connections. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The stroke of the connections indicates the different categories. The color of the connections is purple. Bar chart.
