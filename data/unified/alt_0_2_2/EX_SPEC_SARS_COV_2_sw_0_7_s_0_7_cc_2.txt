Figure with 5 individual charts. Briefly, these are 2 different charts with rectangles, chart with vertical lines and chart with text, a ideogram and chart with text, a bar chart and chart with text and a chart with connections.Chart with rectangles, chart with vertical lines and chart with text. Chart is titled 'NC_045512.2 Genes'. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.   The color of the rectangles is pink. The color of the lines is sky blue. The color of the text is pink. The x-axis has a brush, linking to one of the other charts. Ideogram and chart with text. Chart is titled 'S Protein Annotation'. The genome is shown on the x-axis.  The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the rectangles indicates the different categories. The color of the text is black. Chart with rectangles, chart with vertical lines and chart with text. Chart is titled 'NC_045512.2 Genes'. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.   The color of the rectangles is navy blue. The color of the lines is white. The color of the text is black. Bar chart and chart with text. Chart is titled 'NC_045512.2 Sequence'. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The color of the bars indicates the different categories. The color of the text is white. Chart with connections. Chart is titled 'TRS-L-Dependent Recombination Events'. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.   The color of the connections is green.
