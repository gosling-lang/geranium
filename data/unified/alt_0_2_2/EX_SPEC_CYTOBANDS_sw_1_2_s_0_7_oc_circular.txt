Figure with 10 individual charts. Briefly, these are 5 different circular charts with area displayed and 5 different circular charts with text, circular ideogram, circular chart with rectangles, circular chart with right triangles and circular chart with left triangles.Circular chart with area displayed. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with area displayed. The color of the area displayed indicates the different categories.  Circular chart with text, circular ideogram, circular chart with rectangles, circular chart with right triangles and circular chart with left triangles. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The color of the rectangles indicates the different categories. The color of the text is black. The color of the rectangles is purple. The color of the right triangles is maroon. The color of the left triangles is maroon. Circular chart with area displayed. The genome is shown on the x-axis.
