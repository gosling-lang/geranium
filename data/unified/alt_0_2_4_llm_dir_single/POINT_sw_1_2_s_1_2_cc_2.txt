The visualization is a scatter plot titled "Basic Marks: point," with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples." It uses a linear layout to display genomic data from the multivec file associated with dataset "UvVPeLHuRDiYA3qwFlm7xQ." The x-axis represents genomic positions across the human genome assembly hg38, labeled with chromosome numbers (e.g., chr1, chr2, etc.). The y-axis indicates quantitative expression values labeled as "peak," and this field also controls the size of the points. Each point is uniformly colored in light purple (#b59bf2), encoding no additional categorical differentiation. The chart is interactive with zoom capabilities, configured with a width of 1152 pixels and a height of 246 pixels, allowing a detailed examination of genomic data associated with "sample 1."
