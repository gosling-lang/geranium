Figure with 3 individual charts. Briefly, these are a line chart, a circular scatter plot and a scatter plot.Line chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the lines.  Circular scatter plot. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with points. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the points is biloba flower. The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Scatter plot. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with points.
