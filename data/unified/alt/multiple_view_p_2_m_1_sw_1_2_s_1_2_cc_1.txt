Figure with 3 individual charts. Briefly, these are a bar chart, a circular bar chart and a scatter plot.Bar chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the bars is biloba flower. The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Circular bar chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the bars is geraldine. The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Scatter plot. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with points. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the points.
