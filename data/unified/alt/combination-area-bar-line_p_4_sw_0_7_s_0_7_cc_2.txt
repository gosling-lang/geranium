The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The color of the bars indicates the different categories.  Chart with area displayed. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with area displayed. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the area displayed.  Line chart and scatter plot. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines and points. The height of the expression values is shown with the size-axis. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the lines is geraldine. The color of the points is biloba flower.
