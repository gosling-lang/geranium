Figure with 4 individual charts. Briefly, these are a bar chart, a heat map, a scatter plot and a line chart and scatter plot.Bar chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression values are shown with bars on the y and ye-axes. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the bars.  Heat map. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression values are encoded using color intensity. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories.  Scatter plot. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression values are shown with points on the y and size-axes. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the points.  Line chart and scatter plot. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines and points. The height of the expression values is shown with the size-axis. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the lines is sushi. The color of the points is sushi.
