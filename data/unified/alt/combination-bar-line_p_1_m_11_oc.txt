Figure with two charts. Top track is a scatter plot.  The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression values are shown with points on the y and size-axes. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the points.   Bottom track is a line chart.  The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines. The color of the lines indicates the different categories.
