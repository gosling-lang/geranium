Figure with 3 individual charts. Briefly, these are a bar chart, a line chart and scatter plot and a scatter plot.Bar chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression values are shown with bars on the y and ye-axes. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the bars.  Line chart and scatter plot. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines and points. The height of the expression values is shown with the size-axis. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the lines is geraldine. The color of the points is malibu. Scatter plot. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression values are shown with points on the y and size-axes. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the points.
