The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the lines.  Circular scatter plot. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with points. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the points is malibu. The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Chart with area displayed. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with area displayed.
