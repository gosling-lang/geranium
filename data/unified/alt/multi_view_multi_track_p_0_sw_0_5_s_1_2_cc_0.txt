Figure with 4 individual charts. Briefly, these are a scatter plot, a bar chart, a line chart and a chart with area displayed.Scatter plot. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression values are shown with points on the y and size-axes. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the points.  Bar chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the bars.  Line chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the lines.  Chart with area displayed. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with area displayed. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the area displayed.
