Figure with 3 individual charts. Briefly, these are a bar chart, a circular scatter plot and a chart with area displayed.Bar chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the bars.  The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Circular scatter plot. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with points. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the points.  The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Chart with area displayed. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with area displayed. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the area displayed.
