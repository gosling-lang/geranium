Figure with 10 individual charts. Briefly, these are a ideogram and chart with triangles, 2 different line charts, 3 different bar charts, a scatter plot, a chart with area displayed, a unknown chart and a chart with connections.Ideogram and chart with triangles. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The color of the rectangles indicates the different categories. The color of the triangles is bright red. Line chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines.  The color of the lines is sushi. Line chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines.  The color of the lines is geraldine. Bar chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars.  The color of the bars is geraldine. Scatter plot. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with points.  The color of the points is malibu. Chart with area displayed. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with area displayed.  The color of the area displayed is biloba flower. Bar chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars.  The color of the bars is malibu. Bar chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars.  The color of the bars is malibu. Unknown chart.   The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the undefined.  Chart with connections. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The height of the connections indicates the different categories. The color of the connections is geraldine.
