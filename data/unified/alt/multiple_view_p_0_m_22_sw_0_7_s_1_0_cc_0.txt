The expression is shown on the y-axis with points. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the points is sushi. The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Chart with area displayed. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with area displayed. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the area displayed is biloba flower. The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Scatter plot. The genome is shown on the x-axis.
