Figure with 4 individual charts. Briefly, these are a scatter plot, 2 different bar charts and a line chart.Scatter plot. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with points.  The color of the points is biloba flower. Bar chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars.  The color of the bars is biloba flower. Bar chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars.  The color of the bars is biloba flower. Line chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression values are shown with lines on the y and size-axes.  The color of the lines is biloba flower.
