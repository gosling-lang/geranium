Figure with 4 individual charts. Briefly, these are a scatter plot, a bar chart and 2 different line charts.Scatter plot. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with points.  The color of the points is geraldine. Bar chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression values are shown with bars on the y and size-axes.  The color of the bars is geraldine. Line chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines.  The color of the lines is geraldine. Line chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines.  The color of the lines is biloba flower.
