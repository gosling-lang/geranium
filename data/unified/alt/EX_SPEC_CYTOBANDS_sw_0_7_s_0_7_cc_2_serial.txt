Figure with 10 individual charts. Briefly, these are 5 different charts with area displayed and 5 different ideogram and charts with text, rectangles and left and right triangles.Chart with area displayed. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with area displayed. The color of the area displayed indicates the different categories.  Ideogram and chart with text, rectangles and left and right triangles. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The color of the rectangles indicates the different categories. The color of the text is black. The color of the rectangles is purple. The color of the right triangles is maroon. The color of the left triangles is maroon. Chart with area displayed.
