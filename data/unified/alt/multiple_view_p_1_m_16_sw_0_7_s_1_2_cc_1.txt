Figure with 3 individual charts. Briefly, these are a bar chart, a circular chart with area displayed and a scatter plot.Bar chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the bars.  Circular chart with area displayed. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with area displayed. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the area displayed is biloba flower. The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Scatter plot. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with points. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the points is geraldine. The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart.
