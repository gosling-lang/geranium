Figure with 3 individual charts. Briefly, these are a scatter plot, a circular chart with area displayed and a chart with area displayed.Scatter plot. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with points. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the points.  Circular chart with area displayed. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with area displayed. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the area displayed.  The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Chart with area displayed. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.
