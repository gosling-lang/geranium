The expression values are shown with points on the y and size-axes.  The color of the points is biloba flower. Chart with area displayed. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with area displayed.  The color of the area displayed is sushi. Bar chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars.  The color of the bars is sushi. Line chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines.  The color of the lines is geraldine.
