Figure with two charts. Left track is a circular line chart and circular scatter plot.  The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines and points. The height of the expression values is shown with the size-axis. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the lines is malibu. The color of the points is malibu.  Right track is a circular bar chart.  The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The color of the bars indicates the different categories.
