Figure with 4 individual charts. Briefly, these are a circular scatter plot, a unknown chart, a line chart and a bar chart.Circular scatter plot. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with points. The color of the points indicates the different categories.  Unknown chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.    Line chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the lines.  Bar chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the bars.
