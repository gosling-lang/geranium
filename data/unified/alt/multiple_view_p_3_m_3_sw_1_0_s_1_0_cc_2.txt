Figure with 3 individual charts. Briefly, these are a scatter plot, a chart with area displayed and a circular bar chart.Scatter plot. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with points. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the points.  Chart with area displayed. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with area displayed. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the area displayed is malibu. The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Circular bar chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the bars is malibu. The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart.
