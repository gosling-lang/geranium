Figure with 4 individual charts. Briefly, these are 2 different bar charts, a unknown chart and a overlaid chart with rectangles, bar chart and bar chart.Bar chart. Chart is titled 'Gap'. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars.  The color of the bars is gray. Bar chart. Chart is titled 'Conservation'. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression values are shown with bars on the y and color-axes.   Unknown chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis.  The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the undefined.  Overlaid chart with rectangles, bar chart and bar chart. Multiple tracks are overlaid in this chart. Overlaid track 1. Chart with rectangles. The genome is shown on the x-axis.  The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the rectangles.   Overlaid track 2. Bar chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression values are shown with bars on the y and color-axes.    Overlaid track 3. Bar chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars.  The color of the bars is gray.
