The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the bars.  Circular bar chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the bars is biloba flower. The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Chart with area displayed. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with area displayed.
