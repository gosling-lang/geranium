Figure with 3 individual charts. Briefly, these are a line chart, a chart with area displayed and a circular scatter plot.Line chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the lines.  Chart with area displayed. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with area displayed. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the area displayed is malibu. The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Circular scatter plot. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with points. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the points is malibu. The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart.
