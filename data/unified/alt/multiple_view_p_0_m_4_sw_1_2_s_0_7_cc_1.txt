The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the bars is biloba flower. The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Line chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the lines is geraldine. The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Bar chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories.
