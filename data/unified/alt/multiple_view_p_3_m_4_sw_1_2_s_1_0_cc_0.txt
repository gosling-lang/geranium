The expression is shown on the y-axis with area displayed. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the area displayed.  Line chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the lines is biloba flower. The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Circular chart with area displayed. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with area displayed.
