Figure with 5 individual charts. Briefly, these are a ideogram, chart with right triangles and chart with left triangles, a chart with right triangles and chart with left triangles, 2 different charts with rectangles and a chart with connections.Ideogram, chart with right triangles and chart with left triangles. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The color of the rectangles, right triangles and left triangles indicates the different categories.  Chart with right triangles and chart with left triangles. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The genome is shown on the x-axis.  The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the right triangles and left triangles.  Chart with rectangles. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.   The color of the rectangles is green. Chart with rectangles. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.   The color of the rectangles is pink. Chart with connections. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The categories are shown with the color and stroke of the connections.
