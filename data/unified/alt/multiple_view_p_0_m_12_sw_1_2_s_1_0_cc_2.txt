Figure with 3 individual charts. Briefly, these are a circular line chart and 2 different scatter plots.Circular line chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the lines is geraldine. The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Scatter plot. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with points. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The color of the points is geraldine. The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Scatter plot. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with points. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the points.
