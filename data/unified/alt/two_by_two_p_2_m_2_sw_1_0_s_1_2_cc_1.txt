Figure with 4 individual charts. Briefly, these are 2 different line charts, a chart with area displayed and a scatter plot.Line chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines.  The color of the lines is biloba flower. Chart with area displayed. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression values are shown with area displayed on the y and size-axes.  The color of the area displayed is biloba flower. Scatter plot. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with points.  The color of the points is biloba flower. Line chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines.  The color of the lines is geraldine.
