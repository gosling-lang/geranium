Figure with 5 individual charts. Briefly, these are a ideogram, chart with rectangles, chart with text and chart with text, a ideogram and 3 different charts with connections.Ideogram, chart with rectangles, chart with text and chart with text. Chart is titled 'Chromosome 5'. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The color of the rectangles indicates the different categories. The color of the rectangles is pink. The color of the text is sky blue. The color of the text is sky blue. The x-axis has a brush, linking to one of the other charts. Ideogram. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color and stroke of the rectangles.  The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Chart with connections. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.   The color of the connections is pink. The x-axis has a brush, linking to the other chart. Chart with connections. Chart is titled 'Region of Interest'. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the stroke of the connections. The color of the connections is sky blue. Chart with connections. Chart is titled 'Rearrangement View'.
