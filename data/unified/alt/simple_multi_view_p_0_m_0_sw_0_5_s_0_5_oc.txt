Figure with 4 individual charts. Briefly, these are a circular bar chart, a unknown chart, a chart with area displayed and a line chart.Circular bar chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The color of the bars indicates the different categories.  Unknown chart. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.  The color of the undefined indicates the different categories.  Chart with area displayed. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with area displayed. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the area displayed.  Line chart. The genome is shown on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with lines. The chart is stratified by rows for the categories. The categories are also shown with the color of the lines.
