The visualization is a scatter plot titled "Basic Marks: point" from the "Tutorial Examples" series. It displays genomic data along a linear, horizontal layout. The x-axis showcases genomic positions corresponding to chromosome labels ranging from chr1 to chrY, while the y-axis represents quantitative peak expression values. Each data point is depicted by a purple circle, whose size also corresponds to the peak values, adding a visual cue to the scatter plot. The data is sourced from a multivec tileset, focusing on "sample 1," and is intended for the human genome assembly hg38. The plot provides a clear representation of expression levels across different chromosomes, facilitating genomic data interpretation.
