The visualization titled "Basic Marks: Text" with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples" presents a genomic data display using a linear, horizontal layout. The x-axis represents genomic intervals labeled with chromosome numbers (e.g., chr1, chr2), while the y-axis displays quantitative data, specifically the count of nucleotide bases. The visualization employs a text mark to indicate the four nucleotide bases (A, T, G, C), each colored distinctly: A in blue (#1f77b4), T in orange (#ff7f0e), G in green (#2ca02c), and C in red (#d62728). The text is styled with no stroke width for clarity. The data is sourced from a multivec file located at the provided URL, with a bin size of 16. This chart is interactive and dynamically stretches to fit the available width (560px) and height (210px), using genomic coordinates to ensure an accurate representation of the sequence data. This visualization serves as an educational example for displaying genomic data with text-based encoding.
