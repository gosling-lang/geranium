The visualization depicted is a circular "Circos" plot that presents genomic data in three distinct layers. It integrates a circular bar chart on the outermost layer, which visualizes genomic positions on the x-axis and expression peak values on the y-axis as purple bars. The middle layer features a circular ideogram that displays chromosomal intervals, where each rectangle's color represents different stain categories, adding categorical depth. The innermost layer includes a circular chart showcasing genomic connections with multicolored lines, highlighting various genomic interactions. This comprehensive and color-coded visualization serves as a static representation of genomic data with interactive attributes designated for multimodal search functionality.
