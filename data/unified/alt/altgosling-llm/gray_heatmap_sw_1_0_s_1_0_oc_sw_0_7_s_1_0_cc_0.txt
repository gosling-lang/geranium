This visualization is a static heatmap representing genomic data. Genomic intervals are plotted on both the horizontal and vertical axes, using a linear layout and the hg38 genome assembly. Each axis is labeled with chromosome identifiers, and intervals are marked with rectangles. The intensity of the color, ranging from light to dark brown, indicates quantitative expression values. The color scheme follows a "hot" range, emphasizing higher values with more intense colors. The visualization is 310 pixels wide and 430 pixels high, with a center radius of 0.3 and a spacing of 10 pixels. The genomic coordinates are linked, providing a comprehensive view of the data distribution and expression across chromosomes.
