The image represents a genomic data visualization titled "Basic Marks: area" with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples." The chart uses linear layout to display data in an area mark style. The x-axis represents genomic positions across multiple chromosomes, labeled from chr1 to chrX. The y-axis quantifies expression levels, denoted as "peak," indicating quantitative metrics for the genomic data. The chart prominently features data from a category labeled as "sample 1," which is rendered in a contiguous area fill, visually emphasizing variations across genomic regions. The chart's dimensions are 1152 pixels in width and 246 pixels in height, with the data sourced from a specified URL. The style is static, oriented horizontally, and designed for genomic visualization, highlighting peaks in expression across a genomic sequence.
