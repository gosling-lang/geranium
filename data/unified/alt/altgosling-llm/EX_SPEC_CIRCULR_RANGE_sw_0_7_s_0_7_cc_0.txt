The visualization is a circular bar chart representing genomic data. The layout is circular with a central radius ratio of 0.3, featuring stacked alignment, and it is statically rendered with a spacing of 1. The visualization is centered on the hg38 genome assembly, displaying genome positions on the x-axis and quantitative expression values on the y-axis, showcased through pink-colored bars. The circular arrangement visually encodes genomic positions around the central circle and extends radially outward to depict expression peaks. Each segment corresponds to specific chromosomes labeled around the circle. The chart is designed for horizontal orientation, with a predefined zoom constraint and dimensions of approximately 343x343 units.
