The visualization is a line chart in a linear layout representing a multivec file, showcasing genomic data plotted across the entire genome of hg38. The x-axis denotes genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative expression values depicted by lines. The chart has a title, "Basic Marks: line," and a subtitle, "Tutorial Examples," with a total width of 960 and a height of 246. The line size is specified as 2, without any distinct coloring, focusing purely on expression changes across the genome.
