The figure consists of two vertically arranged tracks within a linear layout, illustrating genomic data from chromosome 1 (positions 1 to 3,000,500). The top track is a multi-row bar chart representing genomic intervals, with expression values displayed as bars. Rows are stratified by sample categories, each marked with distinct colors: blue (sample 1), orange (sample 2), green (sample 3), and red (sample 4). Below, an area chart displays expression values over the same genomic intervals with colored areas corresponding to the same sample categories. This visualization employs the hg38 genome assembly and provides an interactive genomic exploration of data variations across samples.
