The provided visualization consists of two related genomic tracks arranged vertically in a linear layout, focusing on chromosome 1 from base pair 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a bar chart that displays genomic data from a multivec file. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis shows quantitative 'peak' values. Data is stratified into four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each distinguished by color. The bottom track consists of an overlay of area and line charts. The x-axis is similar to the top track, and the y-axis represents the same 'peak' values. The data is organized into rows by sample category, and the expression values' size is encoded along the y-axis. The visualization is interactive, with tooltips providing detailed information for each position, including genomic range and sample category. Overall, this visualization provides a comprehensive view of genomic expression data across multiple samples.
