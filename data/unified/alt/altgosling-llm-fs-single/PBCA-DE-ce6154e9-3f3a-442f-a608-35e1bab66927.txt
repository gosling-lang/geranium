A visualization features a circular and linear layout linked by a blue interactive brush. The circular layout presents an ideogram with chromosomal bands colored by genomic stain, a text annotation track labeled 'Putative Driver,' and two range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' shown as blue and orange arcs respectively. A 'withinLink' track illustrates structural variants like 'Translocations' and 'Duplications,' with connections colored by 'svclass' categories.

The linear layout parallels chromosome 1, including a mirrored ideogram, a scatter plot for 'Point Mutation' colored by mutation subtype, and multicolored point values on a log scale display mutation distances. Moreover, separate tracks show insertions and deletions, represented by colored rectangles, against a 'Copy Number Variants' track illustrating quantitative variations with gray bars. Both layouts highlight genomic positions, enabling comparisons across different genomic data types, enriched with interactive tooltips and a cohesive color legend.
