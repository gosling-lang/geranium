The visualization consists of two tracks in a linear arrangement, focusing on chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The top track is a heat map that displays genomic intervals on the x-axis, categorizing by samples 'sample 1' through 'sample 4'. The color intensity of the heat map represents expression values from a multivec file, using a 'hot' color range for encoding. Below, a bar chart portrays the same samples with genomic positions on the x-axis and expression levels on the y-axis. Each sample is visualized in distinct colors, including blue, orange, green, and red. The heat map and bar chart both provide tooltips for genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample names, enhancing interactivity.
