The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view aligned vertically. The circular view displays the entire genome in a 360-degree arrangement, including tracks like an ideogram, point annotation, and range annotations for genetic variations such as 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH).' These variations are highlighted with different colors, such as blue and orange, respectively. An interactive brush links these to the linear view below.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and includes multiple tracks: ideogram, putative driver annotations, mutations, and structural variants. Each track illustrates genomic data types, including point mutations depicted as a scatter plot where points represent distances to previous mutations, color-coded by mutation subtype. Indel variants are shown as rectangles, and copy number variations (CNVs) are depicted with bars, with color variations providing categorical insights into each variation's type and category, such as 'Insertion' and 'Deletion.' The visualization effectively combines circular and linear genomic data representation to convey a comprehensive view of genetic variations.
