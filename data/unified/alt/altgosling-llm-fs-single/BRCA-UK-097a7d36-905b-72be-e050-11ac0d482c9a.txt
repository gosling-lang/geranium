A circular and linear visualization together display genomic data for hg19. The circular view contains tracks including an ideogram, a text annotation track titled "Putative Driver," and tracks for "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)." These tracks use colors such as blue and dark orange to represent different genomic features. Connections between genomic regions are also shown in the circular view, using various colors to denote different structural variations like translocations and duplications.

The linear view highlights chromosome 1, featuring tracks for an ideogram and a detailed annotation of genes and putative drivers. A scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" shows mutations with colors representing mutation subtypes like C>A and C>T. Additional tracks visualize insertions, deletions, and copy number variants (CNVs) using rectangles, with color coding for gain and loss events. This setup enables an interactive analysis of the genomic landscape and mutations in chromosome 1.
