The visualization is a linear heat map displaying a multivec file. It represents genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The layout is vertical, with the genome depicted on the x-axis. Each row is stratified by sample categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Color intensity indicates expression values, with a quantitative legend provided. The heat map includes a tooltip feature that reveals genomic start and end positions, value, and sample details when hovered over. The visualization utilizes the 'viridis' color scale.
