The visualization comprises three genomic range annotation tracks, each showcasing different genomic regions of chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. 

1. **First Track: "Cyverse-QUBES"**
   - Displays genomic features with gene names annotated.
   - Uses sky blue for text and various genomic elements such as rectangles and arrows (triangles indicating gene direction).
   - Exons are highlighted in green with purple strokes.
   - The track is stratified by strand orientation, with "+" and "-" strands shown in separate rows.

2. **Second Track**
   - Focuses on detailed genomic features without text annotations.
   - Uses sky blue for gene bodies and green for exons.
   - Incorporates grey to indicate additional genomic annotations.
   - Structured similarly with stratification by strand orientation.

3. **Third Track: "GmGDV"**
   - Features gene names, direction indicators, and exons.
   - Utilizes a color scheme to differentiate strands: blue for "+" and orange for "âˆ’."
   - Similar layout with separate rows for each strand orientation to illustrate directional genomic elements visually.

Overall, this visualization provides a layered view of chromosome 3's genomic features, facilitating a detailed comparative analysis of gene structures and orientations across the specified region.
