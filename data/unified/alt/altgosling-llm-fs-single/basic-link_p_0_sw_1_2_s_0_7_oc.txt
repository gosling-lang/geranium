A linear genome visualization using a CSV file illustrates genomic links on chromosome 1. The connections are depicted with steelblue arcs spanning between specified genomic intervals, as indicated by the 's1,' 'e1,' 's2,' and 'e2' fields. The chart, titled 'Basic Marks: Link' with the subtitle 'Tutorial Examples,' uses genomic coordinates along the x-axis. The visualization demonstrates the use of within-link marks to represent data connections across specified genomic ranges on chromosome 1.
