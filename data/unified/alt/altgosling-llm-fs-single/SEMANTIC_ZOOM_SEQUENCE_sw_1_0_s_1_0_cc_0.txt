The visualization displays a bar chart representing genomic data with a feature of semantic zooming. As the chart is zoomed in, text marks indicating base pairs appear. The x-axis shows genomic positions, while the y-axis represents expression through bar heights. Different colors—corresponding to adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C)—visualize the data categories, with a color legend included. The bars are structured in a horizontal linear layout and are linked to a multivec file. The chart includes a bold text style and white text for annotations.
