The visualization presents a comprehensive genomic analysis using linear and circular layouts. The circular view features a full genome ideogram with a blue brush link to the linear view focusing on chromosome 1. It includes a series of tracks: a black-text annotation titled "Putative Driver," blue rectangles for "Gain," dark orange for "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and multi-colored lines for structural variations such as translocations and duplications. The linear view expands on chromosome 1, comprising ideograms, gene annotations with triangles, a colorful scatter plot titled "Point Mutation," and various genomic variation tracks. These additional tracks illustrate insertion and deletion variations, copy number variants (gray), and other structural variations linked to genomic positions. The layout uses color to distinguish various genomic features, enhancing clarity and data interpretation.
