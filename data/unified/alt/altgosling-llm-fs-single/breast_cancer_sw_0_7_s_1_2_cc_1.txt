The visualization comprises five tracks displayed in a linear layout, showcasing genomic data on chromosome 1. At the top, an ideogram with right and left triangles marks cytogenetic bands, with color coding indicating categories like gneg, gpos, and acen. Below, a genomic annotation track displays gene directions using triangles, stratified by strand sign. Two tracks with rectangles represent different data, one colored pink highlighting specific genomic regions, and the other in sky blue indicating high copy number variants (CNVs). The bottom track illustrates genomic rearrangements with connections of varying color and stroke, indicating categories like tandem-duplication and translocation. The entire data pertains to the hg38 genome assembly, utilizing a variety of datasets (beddb, csv) for annotation, CNV, and rearrangement data.
