The visualization is a circular layout titled "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements," containing four distinct tracks. The first track is a circular bar chart representing genomic intervals on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis shown with sky blue bars. The second and fourth tracks are circular ideograms depicting genomic positions and varied categories displayed through colored rectangles. The third track is a circular chart with connection lines linking different genomic positions. These connection lines are shown in light gray and black, representing parallel arrangements. The data comes from multivec and CSV sources, visualized in a static format with a center radius setting of 0.3.
