The visualization presents a genome analysis using both circular and linear views, linked by an interactive brush on the circular view. In the circular view, the entire genome is displayed, highlighting data such as 'Gain' in sky blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in dark orange through colored rectangles. A point annotation track shows driver genes, while connection lines depict various structural variations like duplication and inversion, categorized by color.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, featuring tracks for gene annotations and point mutations. A scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' indicates distances to previous mutations with points colored by subtype. Additionally, range annotations like 'Copy Number Variants' are visualized, highlighting quantitative data fields with gray bars. The layout provides an integrated genome analysis, allowing detailed comparison between genomic positions and structural variations.
