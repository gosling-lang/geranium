A circular and a linear view are arranged vertically, with a blue interactive brush linking them. The circular layout covers the entire genome and contains five tracks: an ideogram, a text annotation track, two range annotation tracks, and a within-link track. The text annotation track visualizes putative driver genes in black text. The range annotation tracks, titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)', display genomic regions in blue and orange rectangles, respectively. The within-link track shows genomic connections with colored lines, representing categories such as 'Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', 'Inversion (TtT)', and 'Inversion (HtH)'.

The linear layout details chromosome 1, featuring nine tracks on top of the circular view's layout. It presents a genomic ideogram, putative driver annotations, gene annotations with triangular and rectangular exon representations, and a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation'. The scatter plot uses a VCF file, colored by mutation subtype, and plots the distance to the previous mutation on the y-axis. Range annotations for insertions and deletions are shown in rows with distinct colors. The 'Copy Number Variants' track displays quantitative data as light grey rectangles. The entire visualization provides a comprehensive multi-layered representation of genomic data with extensive categorical encoding.
