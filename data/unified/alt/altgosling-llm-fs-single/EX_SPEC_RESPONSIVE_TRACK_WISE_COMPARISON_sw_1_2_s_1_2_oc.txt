A genomic visualization in a linear layout, showing data from chromosomes 12 and 8. It includes two main sections, each displaying three bar charts and a genomic range annotation track with text. 

The top section focuses on chromosome 12 (10,140,000 to 10,210,000), with pink-colored tracks. The first track displays annotated gene positions as text and shapes, showing two rows for gene orientations. The next three tracks are bar charts titled 'Sample 1', 'Sample 2', and 'Sample 3', illustrating quantitative data in pink bars.

The bottom section explores chromosome 8 (127,734,000 to 127,744,000), with orange-colored tracks. Three bar charts, titled 'Sample 1', 'Sample 2', and 'Sample 3', show quantitative data with orange bars. Below, an annotation track visualizes gene orientations with text and shapes, indicating gene positions using lines and triangles.

This visualization employs linked axes to integrate data from different chromosomes, leveraging color to distinguish between datasets.
