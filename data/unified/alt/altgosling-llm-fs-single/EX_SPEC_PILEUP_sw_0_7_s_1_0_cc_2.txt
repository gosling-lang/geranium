The visualization, titled "Pileup Track Using BAM Data," presents a linear layout of BAM sequence alignment data for chromosome 1, covering the interval from 136,750 to 139,450. The top track features a bar chart indicating coverage, with bar heights representing the number of aligned reads in specific regions. The bars are colored silver. The bottom track displays a pileup of individual reads, portrayed as rectangles with colors signifying different types of structural variations. Categories include 'normal read', 'deletion (+-)', 'inversion (+ +)', 'inversion (− −)', 'duplication (− +)', 'more than two mates', 'mates not found within chromosome', and 'clipping'. The visualization's interactive elements and the color legend provided enhance the interpretation of structural variants, making it a comprehensive genomic data representation.
