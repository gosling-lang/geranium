The visualization consists of two views laid out vertically, capturing genomic data analysis. The first view includes three tracks: a blue bar chart titled "Gap" depicting gaps in genomic intervals on the y-axis, a bar chart titled "Conservation" using hot color ranges to represent conservation levels, and a chart with colored rectangles and text showing various genomic sequences stratified by rows. Each rectangle's color corresponds to a different base, enhancing categorical identification.

The second view overlays multiple tracks, including rectangles representing genomic bases, a conservation bar chart, and a gap bar chart. These tracks span the full genomic range from position 0 to 396, with the bars showing values on the y-axis but not tied to specific axes. The visualization is part of an interactive alignment chart, with the ability to apply brushes for focused genomic regions and linked exploration across views. The comprehensive genomic alignment is designed for comparative analysis across sequences, highlighting gaps, conservation, and individual bases with distinct color coding.
