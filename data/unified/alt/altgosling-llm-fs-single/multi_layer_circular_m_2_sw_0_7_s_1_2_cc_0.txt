A circular area chart visualizes a multivec dataset, focusing on chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. This chart includes 14 categories with distinct colors such as blue, orange, and green. The visualization displays genomic positions on the x-axis, while quantitative expression values, from a field named 'peak,' are represented along the y-axis. The chart is stratified by rows, corresponding to each sample category. The layout integrates areas with varying opacity levels to indicate different value domains, showcasing the graphical perception of multiple time series as referenced by Javed et al. in their TVCG 2010 study. The plot is designed to offer an interactive view of genomic data, with detailed category-specific representation through colors.
