A circular bar chart in a vertical arrangement visualizes a multivec file, depicting the chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500. The chart is static with a center radius of 0.5 and displays four samples: 'sample 1' in blue, 'sample 2' in orange, 'sample 3' in green, and 'sample 4' in red. The position on the x-axis is genomic, and the y-axis represents quantitative "peak" values. The samples are stratified into different rows and are color-coded according to their categories. Each bar shows the expression values of the respective samples, and tooltips provide additional details, including genomic start and end positions. The entire visualization is sized at 420 by 420 units.
