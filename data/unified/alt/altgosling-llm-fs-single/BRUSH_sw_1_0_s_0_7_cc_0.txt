Here's a detailed description based on the provided visualization:

This visualization represents a genomic data display using a linear layout that showcases two interactive linked line charts. The dataset, formatted as a multivec file, is retrieved from a specified URL and relates to a 'sample' row where 'position' and 'peak' dictate the genomic and quantitative fields, respectively.

In the first chart (top), the entire chromosome 1 is depicted along the x-axis, while the y-axis reflects expression values encoded by green lines. An interactive brush, highlighted in steel blue, allows for the selection and linking of specific genomic regions to the second chart. 

The second chart (bottom) narrows the focus to a specific interval on chromosome 1 (from 200,000,000 to 220,000,000), as determined by the interactive component in the top chart. Here, the expression values are depicted in purple lines, providing a concentrated view of the selected genomic region. 

The overall visualization is titled "Example: Brushing and Linking," illustrating the interplay between broader and detailed genomic displays through linked selection. The use of overlay alignment in both charts supports this functionality, with the top chart employing a default alignment and the bottom chart enhanced by a semi-transparent blue background to highlight the selected region.
