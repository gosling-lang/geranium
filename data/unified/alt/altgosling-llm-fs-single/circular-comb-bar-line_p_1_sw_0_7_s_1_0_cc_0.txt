The visualization consists of two circular charts, both depicting genomic data from chromosome 1 within the interval of 1 to 3,000,500. The left chart combines a line plot with a scatter plot, showing the 'peak' values across different 'samples' (sample 1 to sample 4), each represented by a distinct color. The layout is stratified by rows for categories, and the size of points reflects the height of the 'peak' values. The right chart is a circular bar chart, displaying the same genomic interval with bars colored based on the 'samples,' providing a visual comparison of expression values. Both charts include tooltips for detailed interaction, and legends provide clarity on the sample categories. The visualization is static and focuses on a horizontal circular orientation with a center radius of 0.5.
