A linear bar chart visualizes multivec data showing genomic intervals with a title "Rule Mark" and subtitle "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines." The chart displays the data from the entire genome (hg38) with the x-axis representing genomic positions. The overlay consists of three tracks: a bar chart with purple bars showing the expression values along the y-axis, and two rule tracks. The first rule track shows horizontal and vertical lines corresponding to certain genomic positions, using a quantitative variable for line width. The lines are colored purple and green to represent different categories. The dashed style is applied to these lines.
