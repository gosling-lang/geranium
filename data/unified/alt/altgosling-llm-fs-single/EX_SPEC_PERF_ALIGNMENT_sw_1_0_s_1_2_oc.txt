A comparative visualization in a linear layout illustrates a genomic alignment involving two methods: the "New Approach: Stretching Tiles" and the "Original Approach." The title "Smoother Zoom" guides the viewer to focus on enabling a seamless zoom through scaling elements instead of redrawing them. 

Each linear view is titled and depicts the genome along the x-axis in intervals between positions 350 and 396. Both tracks, composed of rectangles and text, are stratified by categories, with colors representing different categorical values based on the "base" field, while the text is consistently black. The visualization uses a CSV file, showcasing pos-based genomic data and links both views with consistent zoom limits of 1 to 396. 

The top track, "New Approach: Stretching Tiles," employs experimental stretching of graphics for smoother transitions, facilitating more efficient interactions as the elements adjust smoothly during zooming. The bottom track, "Original Approach," functions as a baseline for comparison, maintaining the conventional rendering approach. The information is configured to fit within a width of 960 and height of 510 for each track, producing a collective presentation height of 1030.
