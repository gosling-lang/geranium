A dual-view visualization merges circular and linear arrangements to represent genomic data on hg19. The circular view includes an interactive blue brush, linking it to the linear view, which spans chromosome 1. Circular tracks encompass an ideogram, a point annotation, two range annotations for 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)', and a line-connection track depicting structural variations. The line colors in the connection track reflect categories like 'Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion'. The linear view expands with additional tracks: gene annotations, a scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation' derived from a VCF file that emphasizes diverse mutation subtypes, and two range annotations for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion'. A track depicting 'Copy Number Variants' uses gray rectangles, with data represented by bar positions on a quantitative axis.
