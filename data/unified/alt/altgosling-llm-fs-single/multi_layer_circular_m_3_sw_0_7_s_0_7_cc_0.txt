A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart is stratified into multiple layers, representing different samples, through the arrangement of colored bars. Each layer shows quantitative 'peak' values for each sample, with opacity varying based on specific domains. The colors correspond to categories such as 'sample 1', 'sample 2', up to 'sample 16'. The visualization includes a reference to Javed et al.'s study on graphical perception of multiple time series.
