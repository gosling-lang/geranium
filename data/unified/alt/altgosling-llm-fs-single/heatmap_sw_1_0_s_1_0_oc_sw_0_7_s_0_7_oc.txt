The visualization is a heat map titled "HFFc6_Micro-C," representing genomic data in a linear layout using the hg38 assembly. The x- and y-axes both depict genomic intervals without marked axes. The chart uses a matrix file to display data through colored rectangles, with color intensity reflecting quantitative values in a warm color range. The map measures 294 by 420 units and serves as a representation of expression values across genomic intervals.
