A visualization consisting of two main components: a circular ideogram view and a linear annotated genomic view, linked via an interactive brush. The circular ideogram displays the entire human genome (hg19), highlighting key features such as Gains (in blue) and Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH, in dark orange) through differently colored bars. Multiple tracks within the circular view show connections representing genomic structural variations like Translocations, Duplications, Deletions, and Inversions, coded by color.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, providing detailed analysis across several tracks. It includes an ideogram and annotation tracks that highlight putative driver genes and mutation events. These tracks display diverse data types, such as VCF-derived point mutations (scatter plot), Copy Number Variants (rectangles), and indels ('Insertion' and 'Deletion') against a backdrop of reference chromosome bands. Each track utilizes color and shape to represent data categories efficiently. This visualization effectively bridges global genome depiction with localized chromosome analysis, linked by user-interactive elements.
