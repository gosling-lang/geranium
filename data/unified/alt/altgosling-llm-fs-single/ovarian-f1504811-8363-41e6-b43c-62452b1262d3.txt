The visualization displays a comprehensive overview of genomic information using both circular and linear layouts. The circular view contains five tracks including an ideogram and annotation tracks with text and rectangles, representing genomic data across multiple categories like 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH).' Connections between genomic locations are represented by lines, which are color-coded based on structural variants, including 'Duplication' and 'Deletion.'

The linear view provides a detailed focus on chromosome 1, linked interactively with the circular view. It incorporates a variety of tracks such as genomic annotations, point mutations, and copy number variants. The scatter plot of point mutations uses a VCF file to plot distances to previous mutations, with different colors indicating mutation subtypes. Rectangular tracks represent CNVs and show data such as 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' with distinct colors. The entire arrangement allows an intricate exploration of genomic patterns and variations.
