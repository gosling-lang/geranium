A genomic visualization depicting alignment and conservation data with four distinct tracks. The first track titled "Gap" shows a gray bar chart representing gap values on the y-axis over genomic intervals on the x-axis, illustrating gaps in sequences. The second track titled "Conservation" uses a blue gradient bar chart to represent conservation scores, indicating how well the genomic segments are preserved across different samples. The third track displays a sequence alignment with colored rectangles and labels for each base, stratified by sample name. The colors indicate different nucleotide bases, with black text labels identifying the specific base within each rectangle. The final track overlays genomic data using rectangles and bar charts, enabling an interactive examination of data points through the use of a brush tool, which highlights sequences across the full genomic x-domain.
