The visualization is a linear chart representing insertions and deletions from a VCF file. The genome positions are plotted on the x-axis, with categories displayed as rows labeled 'Insertion' and 'Deletion.' Each genetic event is represented by rectangles, colored to indicate the type of mutation: insertions are highlighted in one color and deletions in another. The subtitle of the chart is "Insertions and deletions from a VCF file," and it features an overlay of text annotations showing concatenated reference and alternate alleles. The chart is styled with a light gray background, emphasizing the genomic alterations across various chromosomes.
