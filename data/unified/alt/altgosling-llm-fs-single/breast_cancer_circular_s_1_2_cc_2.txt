The circular visualization presents an ideogram of the human genome (assembly hg38) with interactive tracks. The outermost track is the ideogram in blue, representing chromosome positions. This is followed by two concentric tracks of rectangles: the inner one displays regions with a loss of heterozygosity in pink, and another shows regions with copy number gains in green. The innermost track features connection lines indicating structural variations such as tandem-duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions. Each line is color-coded according to the svclass category, providing a visual mapping of genomic rearrangements across the genome. These tracks are dynamically linked by genomic coordinates.
