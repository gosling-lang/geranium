The visualization is a heat map presented in a linear layout, depicting a multivec file over chromosome 1, specifically from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The tracks arrange genomic data in rows representing four samples ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'). The data is categorized by 'peak' values, which are visually encoded using a gradient of colors from purple to yellow, where deeper intensity indicates higher values. Each segment on the x-axis corresponds to genomic intervals, while colors reflect quantitative expression levels. Interactivity is facilitated by tooltips that provide specific genomic positions and value details for each segment.
