The visualization is a comprehensive multivec chart in a linear layout featuring genomic data of hg38 overlaid with rule marks. The primary track is a pink bar chart representing 'peak' values across genome intervals on the x-axis and shown on the y-axis. Overlaid tracks consist of horizontal and vertical rules, with dynamic stroke widths based on quantitative 'v' values. The rules, colored green and purple, highlight significant genomic positions such as 100,000 on chromosomes 2, 5, and 10. The title, "Rule Mark," and the subtitle, "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines," provide context for interpreting the annotated visualization.
