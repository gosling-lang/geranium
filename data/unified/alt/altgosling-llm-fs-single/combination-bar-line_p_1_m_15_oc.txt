A linear visualization with a vertical arrangement displays genomic data from a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is an overlay of a line and bar chart, showing expression values across four samples ('sample 1' to 'sample 4') against genomic positions on the x-axis. Expression is marked by lines and bars, while the height of bars reflects the magnitude of the expression values. Colors indicate the respective samples, aiding in stratification by category. The bottom track is a line chart depicting the same data, with colors indicating different samples. Both tracks include detailed tooltips for precise genomic and expression data information.
