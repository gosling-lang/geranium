The visualization titled "GIVE" is a reimplementation of GenoCAT examples. It features a vertical arrangement with two linear view panels. The upper panel displays genomic data for chromosome 17 between positions 20,000,000 and 50,000,000. This section includes a range annotation track titled "Genes," which visualizes genomic intervals via navy blue rectangles, exons with slightly larger rectangles, and rules representing the complete gene range. Below, three bar charts depict quantitative data in purple bars, each illustrating genomic expression at intervals.

Within the same panel, two more tracks include genomic annotations using a white color scheme for acen-stained regions, denoting centromeres using triangles for arms 'p' and 'q'. Another track visualizes segmental duplications on chromosome 17, highlighted by varying colors assigned to different chromosomes.

The lower panel represents chromosome 1 between 109,000,000 and 112,000,000. Similar to the upper panel, it displays genomic annotations and several bar charts, with axes for quantitative displays. The "Genes" track mirrors the layout and color schema of the first panel. This detailed and interactive design facilitates the exploration of genomic features and expression levels across different chromosomes and intervals.
