The visualization consists of two horizontally arranged circular charts within a vertical layout. The left chart is a circular connection plot showing genomic data with color-coded links between genomic positions on chromosome 1, ranging from positions 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. The color of the links represents different categories.

The right chart is a circular area plot displaying genomic expression data across chromosome 1 within the interval from 1 to 3,000,500. It is stratified by rows for categories, with each row representing a sample. The area is also color-coded according to the sample, with four categories labeled 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'. The expression values are encoded on the y-axis, with a legend to indicate sample categories. Both charts utilize a genome-wide view from assembly hg38, maintaining a consistent circular layout with a central radius of 0.5, enhancing the visual linkage between genomic intervals and expression values.
