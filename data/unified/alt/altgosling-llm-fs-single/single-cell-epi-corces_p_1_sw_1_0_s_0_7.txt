A linear genomic visualization titled "Single-cell Epigenomic Analysis" from Corces et al. 2020 features multiple tracks analyzing chromosomal region chr3 from 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. It includes seven bar charts representing peak values from different neuron types, such as Excitatory (orange), Inhibitory (green), Dopaminergic (blue), Microglia (light blue), Oligodendrocytes (purple), Astrocytes (red), and OPCs (pink). A gene annotation track displays genes colored by strand orientation, with blue for positive and red for negative. Overlaying within-link charts visualize PLAC-seq interactions with faint color-coded strokes for different cell types, using Nott et al. data. A bottom ideogram provides a cytogenetic overview of human chromosome 3, with density-based colors and centromeres marked by red triangles.
