A linear line chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying the entire genome of hg38. The data field 'peak' is shown as a line, indicating quantitative values across genomic positions on the x-axis. The title is 'Basic Marks: line' with the subtitle 'Tutorial Examples.' The chart uses a line mark with a size of 2, providing a clear representation of changes in expression values over different genomic regions.
