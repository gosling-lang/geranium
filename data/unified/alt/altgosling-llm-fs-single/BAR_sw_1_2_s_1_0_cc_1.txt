A linear bar chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying genomic data using the hg38 assembly. The chart represents the entire genome with the x-axis showing genomic intervals and the y-axis displaying expression values as bars. Each bar's height corresponds to the 'peak' data field. The bars are colored in sky blue. The chart's title is "Basic Marks: bar" with a subtitle "Tutorial Examples." The layout is horizontal, with dimensions of 960 by 210 pixels. The dataset is categorized under 'sample 1' with a bin size of 5.
