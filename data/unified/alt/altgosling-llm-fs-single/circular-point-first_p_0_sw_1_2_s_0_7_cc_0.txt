A circular scatter plot visualizing a multivec file shows the chromosome 1 region from 1 to 3,000,500. The points represent expression values along the genomic positions on the x-axis, with point sizes also encoding expression magnitudes. The plot is divided into four rows for distinct samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each differentiated by color: blue, orange, green, and red. The visualization is interactive with tooltips providing details for genomic start and end positions, sample identifiers, and expression values. The circular layout enhances the comparative analysis of expression across samples.
