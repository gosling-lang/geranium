A genomic visualization composed of a circular view and a linear view displaying chromosome data from the hg19 assembly. The circular view presents a complete genome ideogram, putative driver annotations, gains in light blue rectangles, and losses of heterozygosity (LOH) in dark orange rectangles. Structural variants like translocations, duplications, deletions, and inversions are shown as connections in different colors. A brush tool links the circular to the linear view, which focuses on chromosome 1. The linear view includes the ideogram, putative driver annotations, gene information with exons and gene labels, point mutations visualized in a scatter plot, categorized in various colors, and copy number variations marked in gray. The layout is vertical, utilizing interactive and visually encoded tracks to convey complex genomic information effectively.
