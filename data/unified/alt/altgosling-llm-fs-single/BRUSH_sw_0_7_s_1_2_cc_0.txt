The visualization consists of two line charts arranged in a linear layout, illustrating multivec data from the entire chromosome 1. The top chart presents genomic positions on the x-axis with quantitative values on the y-axis, displayed in green lines. A blue brush highlights a section, linking it interactively to the bottom chart. The bottom chart, titled "Example: Brushing and Linking," features a zoomed-in view of the selected genomic interval between positions 200,000,000 and 220,000,000. Here, the quantitative data is shown in sky blue against a steel blue background. The interactive brush facilitates detailed exploration of specific genomic segments.
