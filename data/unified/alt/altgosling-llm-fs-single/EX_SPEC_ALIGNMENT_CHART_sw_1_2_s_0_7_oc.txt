A linear visualization of genomic data focusing on a sequence from position 350 to 396. This view comprises two bar charts and a heatmap-like visualization of sequences. The first bar chart, titled 'Gap,' shows gap data using gray bars, with the y-axis representing quantitative gap values. The second chart, 'Conservation,' depicts conservation scores in a color-encoded quantitative format. Below these charts, a heatmap uses rectangles and text to represent different bases, categorically distinguished by various colors. An additional overlay with rectangles and bars captures a broader sequence range with genomic intervals from 0 to 396, utilizing color-coded bars to visualize conservation and gap data. The visualization allows interactive exploration with a black brush tool to select specific data ranges. The charts leverage diverse datasets in CSV format, ensuring detailed genomic representation.
