A linear layout visualization titled "Basic Marks: Link" displays genomic data using links between positions on chromosome 1. The data originates from a CSV file specified with genomic fields. Connections are represented as arcs in steel blue, linking starting and ending points within the chromosome. The x-axis shows genomic intervals, enhancing clarity for the visualized genomic connections. The subtitle reads "Tutorial Examples," indicating an educational context for the visualization. The assembly used is hg38, and the chart spans a width of 960 pixels and a height of 246 pixels.
