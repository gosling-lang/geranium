A linear visualization showcases multivec data along chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a scatter plot where the genomic position is represented on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Points are color-coded by sample category, with a legend included. The bottom track features a stacked bar and area chart. It displays the same genomic positions on the x-axis, with expression levels portrayed through bar heights and areas. The chart is divided into rows for sample categories, using distinct colors for each sample, consistent with the scatter plot legend.
