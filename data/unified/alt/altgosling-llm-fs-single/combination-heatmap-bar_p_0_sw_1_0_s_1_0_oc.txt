A vertical arrangement of two genomic tracks in a linear layout visualizes data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500, using the hg38 assembly. The top track is a heat map that shows expression values for samples 1 to 4, encoded by color intensity, across genomic intervals on the x-axis. Each sample forms a distinct row. The bottom track is a multi-row bar chart that presents the same samples and genomic regions. Bars represent quantitative expression values, with colors corresponding to sample categories. Both tracks provide genomic tooltips for deeper exploration.
