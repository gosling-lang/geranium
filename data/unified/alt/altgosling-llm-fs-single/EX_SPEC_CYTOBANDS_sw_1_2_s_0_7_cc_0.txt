A parallel layout with five sets of linear tracks visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosomes 1 to 5. Each set consists of two tracks: an area chart and an ideogram with genomic annotations. The area charts display quantitative data categorized by 'sample 1' to 'sample 4,' with colors ranging from blue to red. Below, ideograms display the chromosome bands with annotations such as text, purplish rectangles for 'gvar,' and maroon triangles for 'acen' regions. Each chromosome is marked at notable intervals with black labels on bands. The entire visualization uses the hg38 genome assembly.
