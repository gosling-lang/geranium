The visualization consists of genomic tracks showcasing two chromosome regions with annotations and expression data. For chromosome 12, the interval from 10,140,000 to 10,210,000 is displayed. A gene annotation track features genes represented with directional triangles for strands and exon regions marked by rectangles, colored in purple. This track sits atop three bar charts for different samples (Sample 1, Sample 2, Sample 3). Each chart shows quantitative peak values using purple and green bars on the y-axis, linked to genomic start and end positions on the x-axis.

Similarly, chromosome 8 displays an interval from 127,734,000 to 127,744,000. Gene annotations are indicated with directional symbols and exon rectangles in pink. Three bar charts follow, showing quantitative expression for three samples, using purple, sky blue, and green bars, respectively. The responsive design adapts to container size, supporting visibility under varied widths, and maintains a linear horizontal layout, emphasizing data alignment across samples and genomic annotations.
