The visualization is a heat map with a linear layout displaying genomic data from a matrix file based on the hg38 assembly. Genomic intervals are shown on both the x-axis and y-axis. The color intensity represents expression values, ranging through shades of grey, indicating different data values. The static visualization has a width of 310 units and a height of 430 units. The x-axis features a top axis, while the y-axis has a left alignment. This interface offers zoom functionality with no lower limit, ensuring comprehensive genomic exploration.
