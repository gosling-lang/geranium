The visualization is a circular bar chart featuring genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. This chart is organized vertically with a central radius of 0.5, illustrating expression values in four sample categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is differentiated by colors, and the bars are arranged in rows for each category. The x-axis represents the genomic position, and the y-axis demonstrates the quantitative expression levels. Tooltip information includes the start and end positions, expression values, and sample names. The layout is static, with zoom limits applied, offering no interactive features. The entire display measures 294 by 294 units.
