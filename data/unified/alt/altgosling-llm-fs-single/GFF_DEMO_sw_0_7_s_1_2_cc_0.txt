The visualization represents a linear layout of an E. coli genome segment from 222,000 to 240,000 base pairs on chromosome U00096.3. Genes are annotated from a GFF3 file and displayed with their names. The visualization employs arrows and lines to depict gene locations, with directionality indicated by triangles on either end. Genes are colored according to their biotype: protein-coding, tRNA, rRNA, ncRNA, pseudogene, and unknown. The chart is stratified by gene strand, with '+' strand genes pointing right and '-' strand genes pointing left. Smooth paths and different colors enhance the visual segmentation of gene types.
