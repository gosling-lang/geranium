The visualization presents two tracks in a vertical arrangement using a linear layout to visualize genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track features an overlay of line and area marks, stratified by rows representing four samples. These samples are depicted in distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis indicates quantitative peak values. An additional size encoding highlights the magnitude of the expression values within the area marks. The bottom track is a single-line chart sharing the same x-axis, with colors delineating the different samples. This comprehensive visualization provides insights into the variations in peak expressions across the samples, emphasizing the differences and trends within the specified genomic region.
