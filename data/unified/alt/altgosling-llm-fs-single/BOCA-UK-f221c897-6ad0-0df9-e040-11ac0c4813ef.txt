A circular and a linear genomic visualization are arranged vertically. The circular view displays the entire hg19 human genome with chromosome ideograms. It includes tracks for putative driver annotations, colored by structural variation classes such as 'Gain' in blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange. An interactive brush highlights chromosome 1, linking to the detailed linear view below.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, featuring ideograms, driver annotations, and a variety of genomic data tracks. A scatter plot labeled 'Point Mutation' shows mutational distances with color-coded categories (C>A, C>G, etc.). Additional tracks display insertion and deletion events in distinct colors, and 'Copy Number Variants' are visualized as gray rectangles, indicating total copy numbers. Structural variations, including translocations and inversions, are depicted as colored connections, maintaining consistency with the circular view's color scheme.
