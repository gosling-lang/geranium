A linear visualization of chromosome 1 showcases multiple data tracks. At the top, an ideogram with alternating colors represents various chromosomal bands. Below, a gene annotation track uses blue and orange triangles to indicate gene positions and strand orientation. Two separate tracks use green and pink rectangles to depict tumor data, revealing areas with zero minor copy number and high total copy number, respectively. The final track illustrates structural variations as curved connections, colored by category.
