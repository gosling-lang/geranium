The visualization titled "Visual Linking" consists of three distinct charts in a vertical arrangement. At the top, a linear scatter plot displays genomic data from chromosome 1 between 160,000,000 and 200,000,000 base pairs. Each point's position represents a 'peak' value, and the plot is stratified by samples, encoded with colors: blue, orange, green, and red. Below, a circular line chart shows an overview of chromosome 1, with lines differentiating samples in similar colors. This chart has a linked brush that interacts with the detailed linear plot above. At the bottom, an area chart extends the circular chartâ€™s overview, representing the same genomic regions with colored areas. The x-axis of each chart also features interactive brushes, enabling smooth updates of the genomic range and detail view, thus illustrating dynamic linking across multiple perspectives of genomic data.
