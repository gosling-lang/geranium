A circular layout visualization titled "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements" displays genomic data with multiple tracks. The outer track is a bar chart representing expression values depicted in pink. Two circular ideograms are included, displaying genomic intervals with colors indicating different categories based on the "Stain" field, such as gneg, gpos, and others. Between these is a circular chart with links, exhibiting connections across genomic intervals, with strokes in light gray and black. Data is sourced from multivec and CSV files, encompassing both continuous genomic positions and discrete categories. The layout is static, with a centered alignment and a 0.3 radius ratio and a consistent thematic color scheme across charts.
