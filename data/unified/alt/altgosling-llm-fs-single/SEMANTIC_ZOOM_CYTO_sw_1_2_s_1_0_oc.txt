The visualization is a linear chromosomal ideogram showcasing the human genome (hg38). It features a "semantic zooming" technique, with the title "Example: Semantic Zooming" and the subtitle noting the use of text and triangle marks during zoom. Each rectangle represents a chromosome, with colors indicating different categories. Text labels display chromosome names, and triangle marks appear at specific regions when zoomed. The ideogram's outline is gray, with a white inner outline. This setup helps in presenting detailed annotations as users zoom in on data.
