This visualization is a scatter plot in a linear layout displaying point mutations from a VCF file. The genomic positions are represented on the x-axis and the logarithmic distance to the previous mutation on the y-axis. Each point represents a mutation event, colored according to the type of substitution, with categories including C>A, C>G, C>T, T>A, T>C, and T>G. The plot provides insights into mutation distribution across genomes, offering a clear view of mutation types with an additional legend for color coding. The subtitle is "Point mutations from a VCF file."
