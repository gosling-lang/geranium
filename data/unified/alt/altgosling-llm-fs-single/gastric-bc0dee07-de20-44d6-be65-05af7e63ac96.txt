A circular and linear view are arranged vertically, linked by a blue brush in the circular view. The circular view includes an ideogram and tracks for genomic anomalies such as 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' with data displayed in different colors, like blue for 'Gain.' Connections indicate structural variations, including 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' and 'Deletion.' The linear view, focusing on chromosome 1, extends these tracks with additional annotation, depicting gene structures, mutations, and copy number variants. The scatterplot shows point mutations colored by subtype, providing a comprehensive visualization of genomic data.
