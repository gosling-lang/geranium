A circular genome visualization displays five layers in a parallel arrangement. Each layer represents a different chromosome, from 1 to 5, using a multivec file. The area chart encodes genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative data of the 'peak' field on the y-axis. Categories, named 'sample 1' to 'sample 4,' are indicated with varying colors such as blue, orange, green, and red. The chart includes an overlay of cytogenetic bands with annotations. Text marks indicate band names, while rectangles visualize density levels, with colors varying from white to black. Triangular markers highlight centromeric regions in maroon. The static layout centers around a 0.2 radius with a gray outline for band delimitations. The data is based on the hg38 assembly.
