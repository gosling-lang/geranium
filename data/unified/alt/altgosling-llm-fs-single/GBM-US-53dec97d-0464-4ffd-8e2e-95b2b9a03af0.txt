This visualization consists of a combination of a circular and linear layout to provide a comprehensive genomic overview. 

### Circular View:
- **Ideogram Track:** Displays a circular representation of the genome with colors representing different chromosomal bands. A brush tool highlights selected regions.
- **Text Track:** Titled "Putative Driver," this track shows textual annotations stratified by categories.
- **Range Annotation Tracks:** Includes one track showing "Gain" in blue rectangles and another showing "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in orange rectangles.
- **Connection Track:** Lines connect genomic positions, with colors and strokes indicating structural variations such as Translocation, Duplication, Deletion, and types of Inversion.

### Linear View:
- **Linked via Brush:** Reflects chromosome 1 from the circular view, providing a detailed horizontal layout.
- **Ideogram Track:** Displays intervals with categories differentiated by colors.
- **Text Track:** Displays potential genomic drivers, formatted similarly to the circular annotation.
- **Scatter Plot:** Titled "Point Mutation," visualizes VCF data points, with colors indicating different mutation subtypes.
- **Rectangular Tracks:** Include "Insertion" and "Deletion" categories displayed as rows.
- **Copy Number Variants Track:** Shows bar representations in grayscale.
- **Additional Range Annotation Tracks:** Similar to circular, feature "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" with respective colors.

This visualization incorporates multiple tracks and encoding strategies to
