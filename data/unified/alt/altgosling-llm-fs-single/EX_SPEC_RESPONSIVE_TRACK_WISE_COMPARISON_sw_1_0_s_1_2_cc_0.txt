The visualization comprises genomic plots with eight charts, showcasing genomic data across chromosomes 8 and 12. Two genomic range annotation tracks feature text annotations and are stratified by strand categories denoted by colors: purple for chromosome 12 and green for chromosome 8. Each track includes genes represented with arrows: triangleRight for positive strands and triangleLeft for negative strands. Gene names overlay these tracks, and exon regions are depicted as rectangles with lines connecting them. The remaining six tracks are bar charts titled 'Sample 1', 'Sample 2', and 'Sample 3', corresponding to each chromosome. These display genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, with color variations to represent different samples. Sky blue and pink denote chromosome 12, while green and sky blue signify chromosome 8. The genomic interval spans from positions 10,140,000 to 10,210,000 for chromosome 12 and 127,734,000 to 127,744,000 for chromosome 8. Interactive linking provides synchronized views across tracks.
