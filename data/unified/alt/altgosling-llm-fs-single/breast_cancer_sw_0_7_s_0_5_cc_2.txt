A linear layout visualization displays genomic data for chromosome 1 using multiple tracks. The first track is an ideogram with colored rectangles representing different staining patterns and direction markers (triangles) at centromeric regions. The second track is a gene annotation track, displaying gene direction with color-coded triangles based on strand orientation. The third and fourth tracks depict copy number variations, showing genomic intervals in pink and purple rectangles for different conditions. The last track illustrates structural rearrangements with curved lines connecting genomic positions, color-coded by structural variant types such as tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions.
