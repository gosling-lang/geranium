A circular and linear representation of the hg19 genome displays various genomic data types, with a focus on chromosome 1. The circular view comprises an ideogram with a blue brush linking it to the linear view, which showcases chromosome 1. This view is segmented into tracks: a "Putative Driver" annotation track, a "Gain" range track in blue, and a "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" range track in orange, with connections highlighting genomic structural variations like translocations, duplications, and deletions. The linear view includes additional tracks: gene annotations, a "Point Mutation" scatter plot highlighting mutation subtypes with colored points, and range tracks for indels and copy number variations with distinct color codes. Overall, the visualization interlinks genomic annotation and variant data across different formats.
