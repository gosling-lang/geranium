A circular scatter plot visualizes genomic data for chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. Points are color-coded based on 15 samples, excluding an unspecified sample. The layout comprises multiple overlay tracks representing different quantitative ranges for the 'peak' value on the y-axis. The point opacity varies to highlight different intensity levels from 0 to 0.01. The chart is stratified into rows according to sample categories, with each category displayed in a distinct color.
