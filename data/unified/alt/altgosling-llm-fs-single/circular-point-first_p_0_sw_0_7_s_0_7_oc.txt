This visualization is a circular scatter plot displaying genomic data of chromosome 1 within the interval [1, 3,000,500]. Each data point represents expression values plotted against the genomic position. The plot is stratified into rows for four sample categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The size and opacity of the points are encoded by the 'peak' value in a quantitative manner. Each sample category is assigned a unique color indicated in the legend, enhancing visual distinction. The chart centers around a radius of 0.5, with an interactive tooltip to provide detailed information about the data points, including start and end genomic positions, peak value, and sample name.
