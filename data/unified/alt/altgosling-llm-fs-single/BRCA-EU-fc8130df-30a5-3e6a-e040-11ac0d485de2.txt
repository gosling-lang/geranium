A circular and linear view are arranged vertically, linked by an interactive brush in the circular section. The circular view showcases the entire hg19 genome assembly with five tracks: an ideogram, text annotations of putative drivers, and two genomic range tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)'. The connections track visualizes structural variants like 'Translocation', 'Duplication', and 'Inversion'. Genomic ranges in the circular view are visually encoded with colors such as blue for gains and orange for losses. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and replicates these tracks with additional annotations like a gene track and a scatterplot of 'Point Mutation', representing a VCF file. This plot uses color coding for mutation subtypes such as 'C>A' or 'T>G', and two range annotation tracks show insertions and deletions.
