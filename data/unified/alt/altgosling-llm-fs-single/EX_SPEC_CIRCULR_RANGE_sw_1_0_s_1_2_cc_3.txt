A circular bar chart represents a vector file, displaying genomic data across the entire genome with the hg38 assembly. The x-axis encircles the chart, depicting genomic positions, while the y-axis shows quantitative 'peak' values. The bars, colored green, are oriented around a circle with a radius defined by a centerRadius of 0.3. The layout is static, with a stacking alignment and uniform spacing of 1 between bars. The chart features a width and height of 840 pixels, ensuring a comprehensive view of genomic variations throughout the dataset.
