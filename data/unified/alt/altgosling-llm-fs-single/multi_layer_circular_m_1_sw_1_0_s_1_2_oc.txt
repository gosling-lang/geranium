A circular line chart visualizes a multivec file, representing chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The chart consists of multiple lines displaying quantitative expression values on the y-axis. The x-axis denotes genomic positions. The data is categorized into 14 different samples, each showcased with distinct line colors. The chart employs a grid structure, with opacity variations across specific y-value domains to highlight different ranges of peaks. This visualization is based on the study "Graphical perception of Multiple Time Series" by Javed et al., TVCG 2010.
