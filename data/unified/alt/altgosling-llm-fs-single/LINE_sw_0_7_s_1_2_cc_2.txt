A line chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file for hg38 genome assembly. The data field 'peak' is used to represent the y-axis, showing quantitative expression values. The genome position is displayed on the x-axis. Line thickness is set to a size of 2, and the lines are colored in light purple. The chart is titled 'Basic Marks: line' with a subtitle 'Tutorial Examples'.
