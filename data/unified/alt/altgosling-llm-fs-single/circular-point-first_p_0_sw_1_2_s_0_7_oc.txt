A circular scatter plot visualizes a multivec file, displaying genomic data from chromosome 1 ranging between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The plot is stratified into four categories ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4'), with each category represented by different colors of points. These points encode the 'peak' data field through both their size and position on the plot. The visualization uses a circular layout with a semi-transparent appearance for the points, and it includes interactive tooltips providing detailed information such as start and end positions, peak values, and sample names.
