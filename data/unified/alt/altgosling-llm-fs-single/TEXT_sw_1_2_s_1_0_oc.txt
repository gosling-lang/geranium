The visualization titled "Basic Marks: Text" is a text-based chart in a linear layout using the hg38 genome assembly. It displays a multivec file, showing genomic intervals along the x-axis decorated with base sequences ('A', 'T', 'G', 'C') annotated as text. The y-axis represents the quantitative 'count' of each base. Each base is assigned a distinct color according to its category: 'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C'. The genomic positions are indicated at the top, with intervals spanning various chromosomes (chr1 to chrY). The text is styled with no stroke for clarity, allowing for a straightforward visualization of base distribution across the genome. The subtitle of the chart is "Tutorial Examples."
