A composite visualization displays genomic data across multiple tracks in a linear layout. The chart, titled "Mark Displacement," illustrates the use of displacement and visualization techniques to resolve overlaps in genomic marks.

The first track focuses on the hg38 transcript data for chromosome 3 between positions 142,500,000 and 143,000,000. It highlights transcripts in a maximum of 15 rows, using arrows to represent strandedness: blue for positively stranded genes and orange for negatively stranded ones. Text annotations identify specific transcripts, ensuring clarity even with overlapping data using a displacement method.

The middle section, titled "Likely Benign," shows chromosome 2 data from 126,800,000 to 127,700,000. It features points connected by lines to depict benign genomic variants. Text annotations and color codes represent distinct genomic bases, enhanced with a vertical arrow for additional context.

The final track displays a scatter plot of genomic points along chromosome 17, representing various pathogenicity levels through color and position on the y-axis, employing displacement to handle dense data regions effectively.

Overall, the visualization demonstrates advanced genomic data encoding techniques such as displacement, color-coding, and annotation to communicate complex information clearly and effectively.
