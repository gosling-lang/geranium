The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view, showcasing somatic mutations in the human genome assembly hg19. The circular view features multiple tracks, including an ideogram, a text track labeled "Putative Driver," genomic range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and a connections track. The tracks represent categories and variations in genomic intervals using color-coded rectangles and lines. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and includes tracks for ideogram, text annotations, point mutations, insertions, deletions, copy number variants, gains, LOH, and structural variations like translocations, duplications, and inversions. The circular view includes genomic range indicators with color-coded rectangles: blue for gains and orange for LOH. The line-connection track displays different structural variations, categorized by color and stroke. Interactions are facilitated by a blue brush in the circular ideogram, linking to the corresponding linear view region. Each view's tracks are linked, allowing for exploration of genomic variations across different levels, with detailed annotation and interaction capabilities displayed through consistent color schemes and track layouts.
