The visualization is a linear chart titled "Rule Mark" with the subtitle "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines." It features an overlay of three tracks. The primary track is a bar chart displaying genomic data with light gray bars, showing intervals on the x-axis and expression on the y-axis. The second track adds overlaid horizontal and vertical dashed red lines, using JSON data to annotate specific genomic positions. These lines have varying thickness based on expression values, displayed on the y-axis. The third track includes blue vertical dashed lines representing additional specific genomic positions. The genomic data includes chromosome 2, 5, and 10 at the 100,000 position with varying quantitative metrics. The chart utilizes a multivec file for data processing and overlays multiple annotations to enhance genomic data representation.
