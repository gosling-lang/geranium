This visualization consists of multiple circular tracks arranged in a parallel configuration. The outermost track is a bar chart displaying genomic data, where the x-axis represents genomic positions, and the y-axis shows peak values, color-coded in sky blue. Two tracks within the circular layout use ideograms to illustrate chromosomal bands, with colors representing various staining categories such as gneg and gpos. The innermost track features connections in different shades, mapping sequence duplications between genomic regions. The title "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements" encapsulates the integrated analysis of genomic relationships in the circular visualization.
