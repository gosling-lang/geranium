The visualization consists of a circular layout displaying interconnected genomic data in a parallel arrangement. It is composed of four tracks: a circular bar chart, two ideograms, and a connection chart. The bar chart, colored in sky blue, represents expression data on the y-axis. The genome is shown in intervals along the x-axis. The ideograms depict genomic intervals with colored rectangles indicating various categories. The connection chart showcases links between genomic positions, with lines colored in pink displaying structural relationships among different chromosome regions. The title is "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements."
