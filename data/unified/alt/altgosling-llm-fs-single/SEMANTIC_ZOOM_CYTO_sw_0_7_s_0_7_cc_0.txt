The visualization titled "Example: Semantic Zooming" is a linear ideogram depicting chromosome bands from hg38 with semantic zooming capabilities. It uses rectangles to represent chromosomal regions, colored in shades of gray and white to signify different categories. Within the figure, text labels appear on band names that are visible when zooming in, providing further detail. Maroon triangles on either end represent centromeric regions ('acen'), indicating the pericentromeric inversion. The interactive visualization changes visibility of these elements based on zoom level and display size, showcasing genomic intervals along the x-axis.
