A pair of circular charts visualize genomic data for chromosome 1 in intervals from 1 to 3,000,500. The left chart displays connections between genomic positions using a withinLink mark, with areas colored by categories derived from the 's1' field. The x-axis ranges from 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. The right chart is an area chart that illustrates expression values on the y-axis stratified by samples, with colors corresponding to 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The genomic positions are on the x-axis. Both charts share a circular layout with a center radius of 0.5, maintaining visual consistency.
