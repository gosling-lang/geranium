The visualization titled "Breast Cancer Variant (Staaf et al. 2019)" presents the genetic characteristics of RAD51C- and PALB2-altered TNBCs in a detailed genomic layout using hg19 assembly. The structure includes multiple views arranged vertically and horizontally, depicting various genomic data points.

In the circular layout, labeled as "Patient Overview (PD35930a)," genomic intervals are represented through color-coded rectangles indicating different categories like "LOH" in dark orange and "Gain" in green, linked by a blue interactive brush. The "Putative Driver" section displays genes in black text and triangles. A "Structural Variant" track visualizes connections in colors based on categories like "tandem-duplication" (green) and "translocation" (blue), with connections indicating structural variations.

The linear view highlights the chromosome 1 region, featuring tracks such as the "Ideogram," with genomic bands annotated by color and triangles for direction. Another track, "hg38 | Genes," includes gene annotations with strand information and exons shown as rectangles. The "LOH" and "Gain" tracks further visualize genomic ranges in dark orange and green, respectively.

A horizontal arrangement presents coverage and pileup data from a BAM file in two adjacent regions on chromosome 1. Coverage tracks use silver bars to depict expression levels, while pileup tracks illustrate read alignments, color-coded by structural variation types like "normal read" and "deletion."
