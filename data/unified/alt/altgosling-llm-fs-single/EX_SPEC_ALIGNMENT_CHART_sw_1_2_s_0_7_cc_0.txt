The visualization features two main views in a linear layout. The first view focuses on a genomic interval from 350 to 396 and consists of three tracks. The first track is a bar chart titled 'Gap,' displaying gap data as green bars along the y-axis. The second track is another bar chart titled 'Conservation,' which uses a heat color range to show conservation values. The third track overlays rectangles and text, representing genome data across categories with colors indicating different bases.

The second view, aligned as an overlay, spans the entire genomic range from 0 to 396. It contains four overlaid tracks: a genome track with rectangles stratified by rows for categories, two bar charts displaying conservation and gap data with a heat color range and purple bars, respectively, and an interactive brush. The overall design is enriched with genomic data from CSV files, integrating intricate visual encoding with practical data styling, providing a comprehensive view of genomic annotations in a specified range.
