The visualization is a linear scatter plot illustrating point mutations extracted from a VCF file. The x-axis displays genomic positions across various chromosomes such as chr1, chr3, chr5, chr7, chr12, chr16, and chrX. The y-axis represents the logarithmic distance to the previous mutation. Mutations are marked as colored points, with colors indicating different mutation subtypes, including 'C>A', 'C>G', 'C>T', and 'T>A'. The opacity of the points is uniformly set at 0.9, enhancing visibility against the white background. The plot is designed with a vertical arrangement and a centered view, featuring a legend on the right side to assist in identifying mutation types.
