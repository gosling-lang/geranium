A circular chart in a vertical layout visualizes chromosomal connections for chromosome 1, spanning positions 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. The chart uses a within-link mark to display genomic links between different segments. Each connection is colored based on the start position, demonstrating nominal data encoding. The black stroke outlines the links, and the opacity is set at 0.2, giving a transparent overlay effect. The visualization employs data from a CSV file, illustrating the structural relationship within the specified genomic interval. The layout is static, with a center radius set at 0.5 to optimize space usage.
