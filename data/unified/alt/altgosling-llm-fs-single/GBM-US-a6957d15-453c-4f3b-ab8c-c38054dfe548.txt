A circular view and a linear view are arranged vertically, providing an interactive genomic visualization linked by a blue brush. The circular view displays the entire genome with different tracks. These include an ideogram, a point annotation track titled 'Putative Driver,' and range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' that use blue and dark orange colors for genomic ranges. The circular view also includes a line-connection track visualizing genomics positions with categories such as 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.'

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, echoing similar track types as the circular view, plus additional features. It includes a gene annotation track, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation,' and an indel track showing 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' rows. These annotations use different colors for structural variations and subtypes, enhancing genomic data interpretation.
