The visualization features a circular view atop a linear view, linked via an interactive blue brush. The circular view represents the entire genome using a series of tracks, including an ideogram, annotation tracks, and connection lines. The "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" tracks are distinct with blue and orange rectangles, respectively. Connection lines indicate various structural variations like Translocation, Duplication, Deletion, and Inversions (TtT and HtH), each depicted in unique colors.

In the linear view, several genomic elements are laid out along chr1. An ideogram spans the top, followed by a "Putative Driver" text annotation. Below, point mutations are visualized in a scatter plot, with different colors indicating mutation subtypes such as C>A, C>G, C>T, etc.

Further below, tracks display insertions and deletions, while a "Copy Number Variants" track visualizes copy number alterations via shaded rectangles. The range annotation distinctly highlights areas of Gain and LOH, facilitating quick visual analyses of genomic variances.
