A circular visualization features genomic data from chromosomes 1 to 5, arranged in parallel tracks. Each track displays an area chart overlaying cytogenetic bands. The area charts, representing peak values across samples, are color-coded for differentiation. The cytogenetic bands are annotated with text, rectangles, and triangles, indicating density and band classification. The color scheme uses multiple shades, including maroon for centromeric regions and varied shades for density. The view emphasizes static rendering with genomic coordinates rotated outwardly for clarity.
