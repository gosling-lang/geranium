A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file for chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. The chart includes a single track displaying data across four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The height of the bars on the y-axis represents quantitative values from the 'peak' field, while colors (blue, orange, green, red) depict different samples. The chart is interactive, featuring a legend and tooltips that provide start and end positions, peak values, and sample names. It is designed in a horizontal, circular layout with a center radius of 0.5.
