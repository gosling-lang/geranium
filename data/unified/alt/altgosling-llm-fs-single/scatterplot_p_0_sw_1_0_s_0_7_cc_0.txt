The visualization is a scatter plot in a linear layout, showing genomic data for chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. It displays expression values as points, with the x-axis representing genomic positions and the y-axis showing quantitative peak values. The point size is proportional to the peak values, and the colors indicate categories, specifically 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4.' The colors used are blue, orange, green, and red. A legend is present to differentiate between the samples. The opacity of the points is set to 0.5.
