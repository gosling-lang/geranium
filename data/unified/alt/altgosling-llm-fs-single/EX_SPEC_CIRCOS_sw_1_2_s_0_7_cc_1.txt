The visualization is a Circos plot in a circular layout, illustrating genomic data from the hg38 assembly. The outermost layer consists of a bar chart with green bars representing quantitative data along genome positions on the x-axis. Inside, an ideogram displays colorful rectangles indicating different chromosomal stains, with categories like gneg, gpos25, and acen. At the center, connections link genomic positions using a CSV dataset, with strokes of varying colors such as orange, green, and blue. These connections highlight relationships across different chromosomes. The chart is static, with tracks stacked and aligned concentrically, creating an informative and aesthetic representation of genome-wide interactions. The plot is titled "Circos" and provides a visual overview of complex genomic arrangements.
