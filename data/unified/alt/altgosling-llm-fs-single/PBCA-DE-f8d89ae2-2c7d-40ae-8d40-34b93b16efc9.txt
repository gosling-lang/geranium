A visualization combining a circular and a linear view emphasizes comprehensive genomic data. The circular view features an ideogram with various elements: an annotation track, two range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' with blue and orange rectangles, respectively, and a line-connection track displaying links between genomic positions, colored based on the 'svclass' categories ('Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', etc.).

The interactive brush in the circular ideogram links to the linear view, focusing on chromosome 1. This view encompasses an ideogram with triangles indicating centromeres and telomeres, a "Putative Driver" annotation track with gene names, a "Point Mutation" scatterplot utilizing a VCF fileâ€”points signify mutations with colors representing 'SUBTYPE', and range annotations highlighting VCF files that mark 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' with colored rectangles. Furthermore, the "Copy Number Variants" track presents quantitative data as gray bars. This intricate layout, traversing the hg19 assembly, facilitates mutation and variant analysis efficiently.
