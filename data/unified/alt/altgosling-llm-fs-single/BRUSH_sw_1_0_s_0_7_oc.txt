The visualization is comprised of two linear line charts showing genomic data of chromosome 1 from a multivec file. The top chart displays data across the whole chromosome, featuring a sky blue interactive brush that links to the bottom chart. This brush allows users to select a specific range (200,000,000 to 220,000,000) on the x-axis, which is reflected in the bottom chart. Both charts represent expression values, shown on the y-axis with yellow lines. The background of the bottom chart is tinted light steel blue highlighting the selected range. The title "Example: Brushing and Linking" indicates the interactive and linked nature of the visualization.
