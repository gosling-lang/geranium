A circular and linear view appear in a vertical arrangement. The circular view, serving as an overview, represents the entire genome using an ideogram and several annotation tracks. A blue interactive brush highlights chromosome 1, linking it to the detailed linear view below. The circular view includes tracks for 'Ideogram,' 'Putative Driver' annotations, and genomic ranges titled 'Gain' in blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange. Connections between genomic positions in different categories are indicated by lines in various colors, corresponding to the 'svclass' field.

The linear view zooms into the region of chromosome 1, displaying a rich set of tracks including another 'Ideogram,' 'Putative Driver' texts, and a gene annotation track. A scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' visualizes somatic mutations, with the color of each point indicating a specific mutation subtype. Rectangular annotations represent 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' events, while 'Copy Number Variants' are shown as gray bars, with their heights representing 'total_cn' values. The tracks for 'Gain' and 'LOH' are repeated here to maintain context with the circular overview. Different structural variant types are represented with connections of varying colors and patterns.
