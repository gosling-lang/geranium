The visualization represents a genomic ideogram of chromosome 7 from the human genome assembly hg38, displayed in a linear layout. It uses various marks, including text labels and colored rectangles, to indicate regions classified by staining types such as gneg, gpos, and gvar. The visualization includes color-coded text and triangle markers to highlight specific genomic features. Some genes are annotated with text in grey for clear identification. The entire view is responsive to size, ensuring adaptability to different display dimensions.
