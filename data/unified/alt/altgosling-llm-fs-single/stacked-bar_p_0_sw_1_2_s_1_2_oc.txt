A vertically arranged linear bar chart visualizes a multivec file showing chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 of the hg38 assembly. The x-axis represents genomic positions, and the y-axis represents quantitative values (peak) for different samples. The chart includes bars colored by four samples, with colors indicated in the legend. Each sample group is a category, with colors including gold, magenta, blue, and light pink for 'sample 1' through 'sample 4.' The chart includes a grid on the y-axis and interactive tooltips showing start and end genomic positions along with the peak values.
