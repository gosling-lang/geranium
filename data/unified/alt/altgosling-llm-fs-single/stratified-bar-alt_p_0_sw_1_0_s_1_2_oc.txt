A multi-row bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, displaying data for chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The chart includes four rows representing 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each row displays bars with colors corresponding to the sample categories. The x-axis represents genomic intervals, while the y-axis shows expression values with a range denoted by the y and ye-fields. The plot is structured vertically, with a top axis for individual genomic intervals and a legend indicating each sample's color.
