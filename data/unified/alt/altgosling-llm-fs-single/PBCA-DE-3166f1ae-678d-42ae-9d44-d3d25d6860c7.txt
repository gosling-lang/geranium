The visualization presents a linear and circular view linked by an interactive blue brush. The circular view displays the entire genome, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. In the circular view, tracks include an ideogram with a brush, a genomic annotation track titled 'Putative Driver' with black text, and range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' shown in blue and orange rectangles, respectively. A line-connection track displays structural variants between genomic positions, with lines colored based on the 'svclass' category, including 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and types of 'Inversion.' The linear view features additional tracks, including a scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation' visualizing VCF data, where points are colored by 'SUBTYPE,' and range annotations display genetic insertion and deletion, as well as copy number variants with color-coded rectangles.
