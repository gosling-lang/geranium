The visualization consists of two stacked scatter plots within a linear layout, displaying multivec data from chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. 

The top scatter plot shows genomic positions on the x-axis, mapping expression values with bubble sizes and colors indicating four different samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', colored in blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The y-axis represents quantitative 'peak' values, with a grid for easy comparison.

The bottom scatter plot is stratified by sample rows, each line representing a sample, maintaining the same color coding as the top plot. This enables better differentiation between samples, aiding in visualizing trends across samples.

Both plots include tooltips displaying start and end genomic positions, peak values, and sample information upon hovering, with an opacity setting of 0.5, ensuring clarity in overlapping data points.
