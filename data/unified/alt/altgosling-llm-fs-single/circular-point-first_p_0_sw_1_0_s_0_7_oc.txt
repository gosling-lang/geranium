A circular scatter plot in a vertical arrangement visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The points represent expression values quantified by size and positioned by genomic coordinates. Points are stratified into four rows labeled 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4,' differentiated by color. The visualization includes tooltips for start and end genomic positions and peak values. The plot is static with a center radius of 0.5.
