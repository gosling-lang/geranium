A circular bar chart visualizes multivec data, focusing on chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The chart is divided into concentric circles, each representing a different sample from categories like 'sample 1' to 'sample 16.' The height of each bar denotes expression levels measured in peaks, categorized into domains with varying opacity. Colors coded for each sample reflect distinct nominal values. The layout is supplemented by data transformations including filtering and domain specifications for enhanced visual contrast. The visualization provides insights into genomic data distribution using a layered, multicolored circular format.
