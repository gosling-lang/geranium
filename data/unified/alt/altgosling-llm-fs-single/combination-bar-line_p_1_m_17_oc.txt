A linear genomic visualization in a vertical layout shows data across chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The dataset includes four samples: 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' At the top is an overlay chart with area plots, each stratified by rows representing different categories. The top chart uses the genomic position on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Color is used to distinguish between samples. Below is a bar chart depicting the same genomic range. Bars' heights indicate expression values, and colors represent different samples. Both charts feature interactive tooltips displaying genomic position, expression value, and sample category.
