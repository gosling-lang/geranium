The visualization is a circular layout with two vertically arranged circular charts, representing genomic data from chromosome 1. The left chart features area plots for four samples, each differentiated by row and distinct colorsâ€”blue, orange, green, and red. These areas illustrate expression values (peak) plotted against genomic positions. The right chart displays connections between genomic regions, with colors indicating various categories. The design maintains a consistent circular theme, enhancing the visual correlation between data sets.
