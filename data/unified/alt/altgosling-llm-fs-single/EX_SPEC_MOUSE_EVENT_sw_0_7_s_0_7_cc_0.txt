A composite visualization in a linear layout titled "Custom Mouse Events" with the subtitle "Customize mouse hovering and range selection events." It includes five tracks.

1. **Individual Marks**: A bar chart visualizes genomic positions on the x-axis and peaks on the y-axis, with bars colored by sample categories. Interactive features allow mouse hovering and range selection with a purple brush. 

2. **Group Marks By Sample**: Similar bar chart as above, but grouped by sample. Mouse events are highlighted with a green brush.

3. **Group Marks By Genomic Position**: Another similar bar chart, but grouped by genomic position. Mouse interactions are indicated with a yellow brush.

4. **Group Marks By Gene**: A track showing gene annotations from chromosome 3, visualized with rectangles and triangles stratified by gene name, colored in gray. Mouse events are highlighted in a light blue and gray coloring scheme.

5. **Group Marks By Chromosome**: An ideogram with text, rectangles, and triangles representing chromosomal bands and densities, colored variously for different categories like density and type. Mouse events highlighted in blue.

Interactive features include mouseOver, rangeSelect, and groupMarksByField for dynamic exploration of genomic data.
