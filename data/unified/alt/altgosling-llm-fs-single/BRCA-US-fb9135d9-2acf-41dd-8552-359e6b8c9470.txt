The visualization consists of a circular and linear view arranged in a vertical layout, connected by an interactive brush. The circular view is a genomic ideogram showing all chromosomes with features like 'Gain' (in blue rectangles) and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' (in orange rectangles). It also includes connection lines in diverse colors, categorizing structural variations such as 'Translocations' and 'Duplications.'

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and contains tracks depicting putative driver genes as text annotations, point mutations colored by subtype, and additional annotations for insertions and deletions. The 'Copy Number Variants' track uses gray rectangles to depict quantitative variation. Both layouts allow detailed genomic insights with interactive elements for exploring specific regions and mutations.
