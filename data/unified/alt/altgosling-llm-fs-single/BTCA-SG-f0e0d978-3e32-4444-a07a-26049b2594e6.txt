A circular and linear genomic visualization presents data from the human genome assembly hg19. The circular view contains multiple tracks, including an ideogram, a text track labeled "Putative Driver," and range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)." These tracks use colors like sky blue for "Gain" and dark orange for "LOH." The connections in the circular view represent structural variations between genomic positions in various colors.

The linear view includes an ideogram linked to chromosome 1, a text track for putative drivers, and a point mutation track visualizing variant call format (VCF) data. The scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" showcases point mutations with different colors based on subtypes, such as "C>A" and "T>G." Additional tracks include genomic range annotations for insertions and deletions, shown in two distinct colors, as well as "Copy Number Variants" depicted in gray bars. Vertical connections in this view mirror those in the circular layout, illustrating structural variations with categories like "Translocation" and "Duplication."

The interactive blue brush in the circular view allows for linked exploration between the two layouts, enhancing data comprehension and navigation.
