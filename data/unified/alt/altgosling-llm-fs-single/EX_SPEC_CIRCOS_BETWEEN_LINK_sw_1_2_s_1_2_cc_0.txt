The visualization is a circular layout titled "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements" that displays genomic data from the hg38 assembly. It consists of four main tracks. The first track is a pink circular bar chart that represents genomic intervals and their corresponding expression values. The second and fourth tracks are circular ideograms that categorize genomic regions using colored rectangles, each color representing a different category such as "gneg," "gpos25," etc. The third track is a circular chart with green connections illustrating genomic links. The layout, with its parallel arrangement, highlights interconnections across different genomic positions through the use of light gray and black strokes. The design leverages sophisticated data encoding techniques like genomic fields and multivec data types to offer an informative view of genomic relationships.
