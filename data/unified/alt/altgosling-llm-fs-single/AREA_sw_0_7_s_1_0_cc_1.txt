A linear area chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying genomic data across the entire genome of hg38. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis quantifies expression levels through the 'peak' data field. The area is colored sky blue to enhance visibility. The chart, titled "Basic Marks: area" with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples," effectively communicates genomic expression data using an area mark to encode quantitative information.
