A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec dataset representing chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The visualization consists of multiple concentric tracks, each stratified by sample categories, excluding "sample -". The tracks are arranged radially, with genomic positions on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis. Different rows represent samples, and the opacity of bars varies within predefined y-axis domains. The colors of the bars correspond to the sample categories. The dataset is processed using a filter to exclude specific categories, and the visualization includes multiple overlays with various opacity settings to highlight data within specific peak value ranges. This design effectively encodes the data by using size, color, and spatial layout to showcase variations in genomic feature intensities across samples.
