The visualization is a linear layout displaying multiple genomic tracks of chromosome 1. The first track is an ideogram with both left and right triangles illustrating different categories. The next track stratifies genomic positions by rows for forward and reverse strands, depicted with blue and orange triangles, respectively. This is followed by two tracks showing genomic intervals as rectangles: one in purple for regions with 0 minor copy number variants in tumors, and another in pink for regions with total copy number variants in tumors greater than 4.5. The final track displays connections representing genomic rearrangements, colored based on structural variant classes like tandem duplications and translocations, and differentiated by strokes.
