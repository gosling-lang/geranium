A linear chart visualizing multivec data from chromosome 1 (positions 1 to 3,000,500) displays four layers, each representing a different sample. The samples, named 'sample 1' through 'sample 4', are colored distinctly: orange, green, blue, and purple. The chart, applied in a linear arrangement, uses both lines and points to encode data. The x-axis maps genomic positions, while the y-axis shows quantitative peaks. Points vary in size based on peak values. A legend differentiates the samples by color, and a tooltip provides genomic position, peak value, and sample information. The entire visualization is enclosed in a compact 600x130-pixel area.
