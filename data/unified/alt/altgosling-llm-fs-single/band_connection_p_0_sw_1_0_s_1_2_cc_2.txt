A linear genomic visualization displays structural variations across chromosome 1 in the interval from 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. The visualization consists of four rectangular tracks and three connection tracks. The rectangles, colored in green and pink, represent genomic segments with specified start and end positions. The connections link these segments, with lines colored in sky blue and purple to indicate different associations. The data source is a CSV file containing genomic fields, and the visualization is configured to allow detailed exploration of genomic relationships through interactive tooltip descriptors.
