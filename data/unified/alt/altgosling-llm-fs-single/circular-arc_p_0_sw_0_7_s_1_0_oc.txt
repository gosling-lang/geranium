The visualization is a circular layout illustrating genomic connections within chromosome 1 between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. This view uses data from a CSV file to map genomic coordinates, highlighting linked genomic regions with varied colors representing categorical differences, and black strokes for delineation. The chart spans a circular arc, with an outer radius approximately half of its width. The transparency of the connections indicates overlap density, indicating the intensity of the interaction between genomic intervals. The center of the circular chart is strategically hollowed, enhancing focus on the data's relational mapping along the chromosomal positions.
