The visualization, titled "Matrix Visualization," compares Micro-C and Hi-C data for HFFc6 cells. It covers chromosome 7 between 77,700,000 and 81,000,000 in two horizontally arranged matrix views. The first view, oriented vertically, includes bar charts for HFFc6_H3K4me3, HFFc6_ATAC, and HFFc6_CTCF, with genomic position annotation using pink and green triangles. The second view features a matrix titled "HFFc6_Micro-C," with color intensity representing expression values. The horizontal view includes similar tracks but adds another matrix titled "HFFc6_Hi-C" and an "Epilogos (hg38)" bar chart, with colors indicating different categories. The layout uses purple, dark green, and orange for bar colors, and matrix colors follow a "hot" color scheme. Each view is detailed with genomic intervals on the x-axis, displaying data positions for comparative insight into chromatin interaction and modification patterns.
