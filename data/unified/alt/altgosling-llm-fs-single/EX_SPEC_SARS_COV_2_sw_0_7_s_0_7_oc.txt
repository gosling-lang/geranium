A linear genomic visualization of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, comprised of two main views. The top view displays gene annotations for the full length of NC_045512.2, using navy blue rectangles with overlaid gene symbols. An interactive brush links this view to a detailed lower view. The lower view features multiple tracks, including protein annotations using color-coded bars for domains such as RBD and HR regions. Underneath, gene sequences are displayed with base pair frequencies shown as stacked bars, color-coded by base. A final track illustrates TRS-L-dependent recombination events using light blue arcs connecting genomic coordinates. The visual layout is informed by the data from WashU Virus Genome Browser, NCBI, and GISAID, with titles and subtitles for context.
