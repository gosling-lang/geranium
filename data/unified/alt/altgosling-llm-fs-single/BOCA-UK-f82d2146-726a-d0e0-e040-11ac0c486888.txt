A circular and linear view are arranged vertically, depicting genomic data from hg19. The circular view offers an overview of the entire genome, with tracks for ideograms, text annotations, genomic regions, and intra-genomic connections. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1. This view includes an ideogram, text annotations, scatter plots for point mutations, genomic range annotations for insertion and deletion, and visualizes copy number variants. Structural variations such as gain, loss of heterozygosity, translocation, duplication, deletion, and inversion are represented with colored connections. Interactive features include a brush linking both views, allowing detailed exploration of genomic intervals.
