A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file for chromosome 12, ranging from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000 base pairs. The chart is stratified by rows representing different samples, with categories determining the color of the bars. The y-axis represents the peak values, and the opacity of the bars varies based on the visibility thresholds linked to track height. The chart supports responsiveness, adapting from circular to linear layout based on aspect ratio. The visualization highlights genomic data distribution across samples, with annotated references to graphical perception research.
