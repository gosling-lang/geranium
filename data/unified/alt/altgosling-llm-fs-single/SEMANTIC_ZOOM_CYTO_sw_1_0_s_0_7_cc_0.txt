The visualization is a linear genomic ideogram depicting various human chromosomes, employing a semantic zooming feature. The title is "Example: Semantic Zooming," with the subtitle highlighting that text and triangle marks will appear upon zooming in for more details. The chart uses rectangles to represent chromosomal bands, with colors differentiating the chromosomes. The presence of triangles, colored maroon for "acen" regions, provides additional marking. Text labels for chromosome names appear alongside their respective bands. The layout adapts when zooming, revealing more detailed annotations within a 560 by 47.5 display area.
