The visualization is composed of a circular view and a linear view, arranged vertically. The circular view includes multiple tracks—an ideogram, annotation tracks, and connections—displaying genomic data from the entire genome. The connections, colored based on a field named 'svclass,' illustrate structural variations such as 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' etc. The linear view zooms into chromosome 1, showing detailed tracks like gene annotations, scatter plots for point mutations, and range annotations like 'Insertion' and 'Deletion.' Each track employs colors and shapes to depict different genomic classifications and variations. The interactive brush in the circular view links to the corresponding region on chromosome 1 in the linear view.
