A linear layout of a line and scatter plot visualizes a multivec dataset across chromosome 1, covering intervals from 1 to 3,000,500. The chart has four rows, each corresponding to different samples named 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4,' shown as lines and points in distinct colors: orange, green, blue, and pink respectively. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis encodes expression values, with the size of the points indicating expression magnitude ranging from 0 to 2. A legend is included for categorical identification of samples, enhancing the visualizationâ€™s interactivity and clarity.
