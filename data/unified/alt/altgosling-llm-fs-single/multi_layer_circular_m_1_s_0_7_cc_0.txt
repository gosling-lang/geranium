A multi-row line chart in a circular layout visualizes a multivec file, displaying data for chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart consists of multiple rows, each corresponding to samples such as 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 6', 'sample 7', and 'sample 8,' while excluding 'sample -'. Lines representing the data are colored differently for each sample, including shades like blue, orange, green, red, purple, brown, and gray. Each line's position is defined by a 'peak' data field, indicating expression values with a quantitative scale from 0 to 0.01. The visualization offers a detailed view of genomic data through its circular and stratified design.
