A comparative visualization in a linear layout shows genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The top chart is a stacked bar chart representing expression levels for four samples using a multivec file. Each sample is mapped to distinct colors, with genomic positions on the x-axis and expression levels on the y-axis, which includes grid lines for reference. The detailed view below is an overlay plot combining a line chart and a scatter plot. This chart stratifies samples into separate rows, providing an in-depth look at trends and variations within each sample, with point sizes varying according to expression values. The arrangement allows for a comprehensive comparison across samples, aiding in identifying significant patterns and variations within the genomic data.
