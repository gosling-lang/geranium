The visualization is a heat map with a linear layout, displaying genomic data from chromosome 5 to chromosome 10 of the hg38 assembly. Both axes represent genomic intervals, with the x-axis ranging from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000. The data is encoded using color intensity in shades of grey, with darker colors indicating higher expression values. The map uses a rectangular mark to represent data points, providing a detailed view of the genomic interactions within the specified range.
