This visualization, titled "Custom Mouse Events," showcases five tracks in a vertical linear layout, featuring bar charts and genomic annotations. The x-axis represents genomic intervals, with five distinct views:

1. **Individual Marks**: A bar chart displaying genomic data for chromosome 1, with categories such as sample 1 to sample 4, in various colors like blue and red.

2. **Group Marks By Sample**: Another bar chart, similarly categorizing data by samples, showing genomic intervals and peak values.

3. **Group Marks By Genomic Position**: A bar chart organizing data by genomic positions, maintaining the sample-based color scheme.

4. **Group Marks By Gene**: A genomic range annotation track for chromosome 3, featuring directional gene annotations with grey triangles and rectangles, enhanced by text labels.

5. **Group Marks By Chromosome**: An ideogram with text, displaying cytogenetic bands for multiple chromosomes, using colors like purple and maroon to indicate different characteristics.

The visualization incorporates interactive mouse events, allowing users to hover, select, and group data by fields such as sample name and genomic position.
