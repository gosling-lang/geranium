A linear genomic visualization with semantic zooming, displaying a multivec dataset across chromosomes. The x-axis represents genomic positions, and the y-axis shows base pair counts with bars. Categories 'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C' are color-coded as blue, orange, green, and red. As users zoom in closer, text labels indicating base pairs appear over the bars. The chart is titled "Example: Semantic Zooming" with a subtitle explaining the zoom-dependent feature of text marks.
