The visualization is a circular layout consisting of a genomic ideogram and multiple annotation tracks. It displays data from the human genome (hg38 assembly) with a focus on structural variations. The outermost track is a circular ideogram color-coded based on different band stain categories, including gneg, gpos, and acen, using a palette of colors such as blue, orange, green, and others. The two inner tracks show genomic copy number variationsâ€”one track uses purple rectangles to indicate regions of zero minor copy number in tumors, and another also in purple for total copy number greater than 4.5. The innermost track features colored curved connections representing structural variants like tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions, each differentiated by stroke color. The overlapping nature of the tracks allows for a composite view to easily spot correlations across multiple genomic features.
