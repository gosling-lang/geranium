A circular bar chart visualizes genomic data from a multivec file. The data covers chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The chart's radial layout features bars representing quantitative 'peak' values along the y-axis, with genomic positions on the x-axis. Each bar is colored according to different 'sample' categories, including 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4,' with colors ranging from blue to red. The legend is visible, providing a key to these categories. The visualization is static, and tooltips provide detailed information on genomic positions and peak values.
