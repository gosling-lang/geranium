A vertical arrangement of two scatter plots visualizes genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs, using a multivec format. The top plot encodes genomic positions on the x-axis and peak expression values on both the y-axis and as point sizes, with color indicating four different samples: sample 1, sample 2, sample 3, and sample 4. The bottom plot stratifies by rows for each sample category, showcasing distinct expression patterns. Both plots employ a semi-transparent point opacity and include tooltip interactions for detailed data exploration.
