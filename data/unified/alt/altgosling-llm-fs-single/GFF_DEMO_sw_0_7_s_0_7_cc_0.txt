### Description

This visualization represents a linear layout of the E. coli genome, specifically focusing on a segment between the genomic positions 222,000 and 240,000 of the chromosome U00096.3. It uses a GFF3 file to depict gene locations and orientations, coloring genes based on their type. The tracks include right and left triangles to indicate the direction of transcription on the positive and negative strands, respectively. Text labels above the track annotate gene names. Rules indicate the span of each gene, with line patterns using distinct markers for different strands. The color scheme distinguishes various gene biotypes, such as protein-coding, tRNA, rRNA, ncRNA, pseudogene, and unknown, using colors like blue, orange, and green. The chart is interactive and responsive, with a smooth path enabled for visual continuity.
