A linear genomic visualization displays various data across chromosome 1. The top track is an ideogram, highlighting different chromosome bands in shades of black, white, and gray. Triangle markers represent different gene strands, colored in blue for positive strands and tan for negative strands. Two additional tracks show genomic intervals using colored rectangles; dark orange represents regions with minor copy number alterations in tumor cells, while green indicates significant total copy number alterations. The bottom-most track is a connection track, showing structural variations with lines connecting different genomic positions, colored according to structural variant classes: green for tandem duplications, blue for translocations, red for deletions, and orange for inversions.
