**Description:**

The visualization consists of a vertical arrangement with two main sections: a circular view on top and two horizontal bar charts below. 

- **Circular View:**
  - The circular layout represents the human genome (hg38 assembly) with chromosomes labeled on the outer ring.
  - Inside the circle, multivec data is visualized using stacked bar charts for samples 1 to 4, differentiated by color.
  - Brush marks link this circular view with detailed bar charts below.
  - Connections between genomic intervals show structural variations (deletion, inversion, translocation, tandem duplication) as lines in varying colors and strokes.

- **Horizontal Bar Charts:**
  - Two horizontal bar charts provide detailed views of chromosomes 5 and 16.
  - Each chart is stratified by sample categories, with colors consistent with the circular view.
  - These charts allow for detailed exploration of genomic data, linked via interactive brushes from the circular view.

Each section is connected, providing a comprehensive overview of genomic data through interactive and color-coded elements.
