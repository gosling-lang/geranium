A circular visualization features two side-by-side tracks, both illustrating genomic data. The left track is a circular bar chart displaying data along chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The y-axis represents quantitative expression values shown as bars, with color coding for different samples: "sample 1" (yellow), "sample 2" (green), "sample 3" (blue), and "sample 4" (pink). The right track combines a circular line chart and scatter plot. It similarly encodes genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, with values represented by lines and size-scaled points. Both tracks include a legend to distinguish between sample groups by color. The visual encoding effectively highlights category-specific differences across samples, enhancing interpretability of complex multivec data.
