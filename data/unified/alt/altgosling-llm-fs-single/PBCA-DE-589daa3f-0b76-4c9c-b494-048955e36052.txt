A detailed visualization features both a circular and a linear view, configured vertically. The circular view encompasses the entire hg19 human genome, where five distinct tracks are emphasized. The first track displays an ideogram with a blue interactive brush to link with the linear view, which zooms into chromosome 1. A text track titled "Putative Driver" annotates specific genes in black. The next two tracks named "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" are represented with sky blue and orange rectangles, respectively. Lastly, the connections track illustrates structural variations through links between genomic coordinates, categorized by color for "Gain," "LOH," "Translocation," "Duplication," "Deletion," "Inversion (TtT)," and "Inversion (HtH)".

The linear view further dissects chromosome 1 across several tracks: an ideogram with triangles indicating centromeres, text annotations for genes, a scatter plot illustrating point mutations, and multiple range tracks highlighting insertions, deletions, copy number variants, gains, and losses of heterozygosity. The scatter plot "Point Mutation" visualizes variations using color-coded points for subtypes like "C>A," "C>G," etc. This extensive layout provides a comprehensive visualization of genomic features and mutations.
