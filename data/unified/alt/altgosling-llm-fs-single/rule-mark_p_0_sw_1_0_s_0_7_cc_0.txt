A linear visualization titled "Rule Mark" focuses on annotating with horizontal and vertical lines. It consists of multiple overlaid tracks. The first track is a bar chart displaying genomic intervals on the x-axis, with expression values shown on the y-axis using purple bars. Two additional tracks overlay horizontal and vertical rules. The rules depict genomic positions, with lines in purple and sky blue, based on JSON values. The visualization uses a dashed line style and represents quantitative expression data with varying stroke widths.
