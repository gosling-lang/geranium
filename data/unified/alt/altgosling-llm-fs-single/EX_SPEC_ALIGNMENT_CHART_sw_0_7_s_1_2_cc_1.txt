A multi-panel visualization consists of two bar charts and two sequence alignment panels. The first bar chart, titled 'Gap,' displays genomic intervals on the x-axis with purple bars indicating gap sizes on the y-axis. The second bar chart, titled 'Conservation,' shows conservation scores across genomic intervals, with a heatmap color scale for expression values. In the sequence alignment panel, rectangles annotated with amino acids are stratified by rows for distinct categories and colored accordingly. The final overlaid chart merges sequence alignment with gap and conservation data, depicted with bars and rectangles, facilitating detailed exploration of nucleotide sequence, gaps, and conservation within the x-domain spanning positions 350 to 396.
