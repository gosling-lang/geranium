The visualization comprises two main genomic regions, each with its own set of tracks. The first region focuses on chromosome 12, from positions 10,140,000 to 10,210,000. It features an overlay genomic annotation track that highlights gene locations and structures, with directional markers indicating gene orientation. The data includes strand-specific triangles and rectangles to denote gene parts. This is followed by three bar charts representing peak values for "Sample 1," "Sample 2," and "Sample 3," colored sky blue and green.

The second region presents chromosome 8, spanning positions 127,734,000 to 127,744,000. It also begins with bar charts for the three samples, but with colors in sky blue and pink for "Sample 3." An overlay genomic annotation track follows, indicating gene structures in purple with directional arrowheads. This comprehensive visualization organizes genomic data in a linear layout, allowing for nuanced comparisons between samples across different genomic regions.
