A linear layout visualization displays a BAM file showing sequence alignment on chromosome 1 from positions 136,750 to 139,450. The top track is a coverage bar chart titled "example_higlass.bam," presenting read density in silver bars. The bottom pileup track uses rectangles to illustrate individual reads, categorized by types of structural variation. Colors represent categories like 'normal read,' 'deletion (+-),' 'inversion (++),' 'duplication (-+),' and others, with a legend indicating meanings. The visualization accommodates interactive exploration with zoom features.
