A linear genomic annotation visualization showcasing gene strands on the genome, titled "Basic Marks: Triangles" with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples." It utilizes a beddb file to display data across the human genome assembly hg38. The chart features rightward triangles representing the '+' strand and leftward triangles representing the '-' strand. Triangles are color-coded: blue for '+' and orange for '-'. The position of the triangles is determined by the genomic coordinates, illustrating gene start and end points on the x-axis. The trackâ€™s opacity is set at 0.8, spanning a height of 100 pixels.
