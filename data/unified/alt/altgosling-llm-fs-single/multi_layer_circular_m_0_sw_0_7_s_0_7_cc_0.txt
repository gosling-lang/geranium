A circular point plot visualizes multivec data, displaying chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The layout is stratified into multiple rows representing different samples, with colors assigned to each sample. The y-position of points indicates expression levels across genomic intervals, with dynamic scaling across highlighted sub-ranges. The circular arrangement offers a compact yet comprehensive view, enhancing the graphical perception of multiple time series, as referenced in Javed et al., TVCG 2010.
