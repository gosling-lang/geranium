A dual-track visualization in a linear layout displays genomic data along chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top track features an area chart representing peak values across four samples ('sample 1' to 'sample 4') with distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. Each row corresponds to a different sample, allowing for comparison across samples. The bottom track showcases a bar chart, again stratified by sample, illustrating the range of peak values (min to max) with the same color scheme. Both tracks feature a genomic x-axis and quantitative y-axes, with tooltips providing detailed data insights.
