A linear scatter plot visualizes point mutations from a VCF file across the genome (hg38). The x-axis represents genomic positions from multiple chromosomes, including chr1, chr3, chr5, chr8, chr11, chr16, and chr22. The y-axis shows the distance to previous mutations, with data points colored by mutation subtype: C>A, C>G, C>T, and T>A. Points are semi-transparent with an opacity value of 0.9. The chart is titled "Point mutations from a VCF file."
