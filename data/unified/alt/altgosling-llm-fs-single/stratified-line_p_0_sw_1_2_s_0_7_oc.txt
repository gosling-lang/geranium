The visualization displays a multi-row line and scatter plot with an overlay alignment, using a multivec file. It shows the genomic data for chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The chart is organized into four rows corresponding to 'sample 1' through 'sample 4'. Each row represents a sample and is colored differently for distinction. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis indicates expression values. Points and lines depict these values, with point sizes reflecting the peak expression levels. The visualization includes a tooltip that provides detailed information about the genomic position, value, and sample when hovering over the elements. The layout ensures clarity with linear arrangement and vertical spacing.
