A comprehensive genomic visualization comprising multiple linear tracks, exploring chromosomes 3, 2, and 17 with textual and graphical annotations. The track titled “hg38 | Transcript (Max. 15 Rows)” displays gene transcripts along chromosome 3 using various shapes, like triangles and rectangles, with displacement to prevent overlap. Genes on the '+' strand are colored blue, while those on the '-' strand are orange.

The “Likely Benign” track on chromosome 2 uses points, text, and connections to represent likely benign variants. Points are green, while connections are in light gray, linking specific genomic positions. Text annotations identify nucleotide changes.

Chromosome 17 features a dense vertical point scatter plot demonstrating pathogenic annotations, each color-coded based on significance categories, such as Pathogenic or Benign. Points are strategically displaced to avoid overlapping.

Overall, the visualization efficiently communicates complex genomic relationships across specified intervals, providing clarity through color, shape, and layout strategies, including dynamic row displacement and interactive elements like legends to enhance interpretability.
