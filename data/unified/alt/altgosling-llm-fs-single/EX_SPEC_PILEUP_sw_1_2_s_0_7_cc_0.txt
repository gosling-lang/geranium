The visualization presents a linear layout illustrating sequence alignment from a BAM file on chromosome 1 between positions 136,750 and 139,450. The top track features a coverage bar chart where the height of the bars represents the number of reads, colored in pale red. Below, a pileup track displays individual reads as colored rectangles. Each read's color signifies a different structural variation category, such as 'normal read' (light gray), 'deletion (+-)', 'inversion (++)', 'inversion (--)', 'duplication (-+)', among others. The tracks are titled "example_higlass.bam" and are stratified by rows reflecting variation types. The visualization is non-static, allowing for interaction and exploration, with detailed tooltips available for genomic positions and attributes. The overall layout is designed to enhance genomic analysis efficiency through clear categorization and comprehensive data representation.
