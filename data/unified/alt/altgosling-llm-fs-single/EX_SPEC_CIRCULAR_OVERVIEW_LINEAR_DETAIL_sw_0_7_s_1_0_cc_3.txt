A visualization displaying data in a circular and linear layout. The circular section is divided into two tracks: a multivec bar chart and a connection track. The bar chart shows genomic intervals for four samples, using colors like blue and orange to differentiate them. Points are indicated by a black stroke. The connection track highlights interactions between genomic positions, color-coded by category, in green strokes. Beneath, two linked horizontal bar charts display data for chromosomes 5 and 16. These charts maintain the color scheme for sample differentiation and display genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Brushes enable interaction between views.
