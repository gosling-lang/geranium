A multi-row area chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, showing the chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. There are four distinct rows, representing 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each displayed in different colors: yellow, green, blue, and pink, respectively. The genomic position is shown along the x-axis, while quantitative values related to 'peak' are displayed on the y-axis. An interactive legend identifies each sample by color.
