The visualization consists of a circular and a linear representation of genomic data from hg19. The circular view contains multiple tracks, displaying an ideogram, putative driver annotations, gain and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) regions, and structural variants (SVs). The circular ideogram shows chromosomes with a blue interactive brush on chromosome 1. Text annotations in black indicate putative driver genes. Rectangular tracks show genomic gains in blue and LOH in orange. The circular track for SVs illustrates connections between genomic positions with colors representing categories such as translocation, duplication, deletion, and inversion.

The linear view aligns with the brush in the circular ideogram, focusing on chromosome 1. It includes a more detailed ideogram, textual gene annotations, a scatter plot for point mutations indicating the distance to previous mutations with colorful categorization based on subtype, and tracks for insertion and deletion with color-coded rectangles. Additional tracks show copy number variants and connections, replicating the categorical SV color scheme. The visualization effectively integrates complex genomic data, providing interactive and informative insights across two views.
