A circular visualization depicting a chromosome segment on the genomic scale hh38 using a CSV file source. The chart features withinLink marks that connect various positions between 103,900,000 and 104,100,000 on chromosome 1. Each connection is colored nominally to represent data categories. The strokes of these connections are in black, with a width of 0.5, and the opacity is set to 0.2, indicating variation in linkage strength or density across the segment. The layout is concentric circular and non-interactive, with axis annotations for significant genomic positions.
