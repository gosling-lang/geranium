A visualization with a circular ideogram view and a linear view displays genomic data for assembly hg19. The circular view includes five tracks: an ideogram, "Putative Driver" annotations using text, and three range annotation tracks titled "Gain," "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and a connections track. The circular visualization links to the linear view through a brush feature. 

The "Gain" and "LOH" tracks highlight genomic regions in light blue and dark orange rectangles, respectively. The connections track visualizes structural variations with curves and lines, colored and styled based on the type of variation, such as "Translocation," "Duplication," or "Inversion."

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, revealing detailed genomic features. It includes ideogram bands, text annotations for genes with prefix information, and a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" that displays point mutations with color-coded data points based on mutation subtype. The view incorporates additional range annotations for "Copy Number Variants," with quantitative data visualized in gray rectangles. Other tracks show insertions and deletions, stratified by category, using colored rectangles.
