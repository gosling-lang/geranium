The visualization features a circular and a linear view arranged vertically. The circular view displays the entire genome with a circular ideogram and several annotation tracks. It includes tracks for 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)', representing genomic regions with blue and orange rectangles respectively. A line-connection track shows structural variations such as translocations or duplications, colored based on the 'svclass' category. This view interacts with a blue brush that links to the linear view.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, featuring detailed tracks such as an ideogram, a 'Putative Driver' text track, a scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation', and range tracks for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion'. The scatterplot uses different colors for mutation subtypes, while the range tracks use colored rectangles to indicate genomic variations. The 'Copy Number Variants' track shows numeric variants with gray bars. The lower part of the linear view also reflects structural variations with connections corresponding to the same categories as in the circular view.
