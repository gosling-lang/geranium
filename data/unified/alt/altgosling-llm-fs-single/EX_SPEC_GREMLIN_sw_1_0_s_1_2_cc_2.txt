A multi-view visualization titled "Gremlin (O'Brien et al. 2010)" showcases genomic data for chromosome 5 in a linear format. The first view features an ideogram of chromosome 5 with various 'Stain' categories represented by different colors. Overlay tracks display structural variations and duplications, where connections are illustrated with blue and green lines. The 'Region of Interest' focuses on a segment from 68,000,000 to 71,000,000 base pairs, highlighting connections within this range. Below, the 'Rearrangement View' zooms into a smaller segment exhibiting detailed rearrangement arcs. Brushes link various views for interactive exploration.
