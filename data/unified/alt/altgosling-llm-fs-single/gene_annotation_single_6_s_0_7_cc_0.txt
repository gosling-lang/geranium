The visualization is a genomic range annotation track titled "Cyverse-QUBES," displayed in a linear layout. It depicts the genomic region of chromosome 3 between 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The visualization includes multiple tracks overlaid vertically, each colored differently to represent various elements: genes are shown with text in green, right triangles in purple denote the end positions of genes on the positive strand, and left triangles in sky blue indicate the start positions on the negative strand. Purple rectangles represent the gene bodies, while green rectangles and lines highlight exons and connections, respectively. This genomic annotation is arranged into two rows according to strand orientation.
