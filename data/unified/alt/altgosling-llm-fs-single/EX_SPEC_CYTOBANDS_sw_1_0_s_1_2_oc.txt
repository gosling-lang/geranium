A parallel track layout visualizes genomic data across chromosomes 1 to 5, using area charts and ideograms. Each chromosome is represented in an area chart, where the x-axis shows genomic positions and the y-axis displays quantitative data from four sample categories, differentiated by color. Below each area chart is an ideogram with text labels and colored rectangles representing cytogenetic bands. These bands are displayed in varying shades from white to black to indicate density, with special markers in light blue, and maroon triangles for acentric (acen) regions. The visualization is static with linear layouts and includes domain-specific linking.
