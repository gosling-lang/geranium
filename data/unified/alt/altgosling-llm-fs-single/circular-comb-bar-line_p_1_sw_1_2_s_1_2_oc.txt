A circular visualization with two tracks represents genomic data from chromosome 1 within the interval 1 to 3,000,500. The left track features a circular line and scatter plot, stratified by samples 1 to 4, with expression values represented by both lines and points, colored based on categories. The right track is a circular bar chart showing expression values with bars, categorized by color for each sample. The visualization uses a multivec dataset and includes genomic fields like position and peak for data encoding.
