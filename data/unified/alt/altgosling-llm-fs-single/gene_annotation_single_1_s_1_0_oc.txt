A horizontal genomic range annotation track visualizes a beddb file, displaying the interval of chromosome 3 between 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The track is titled 'Corces et al.' and shows gene annotations using text and rectangles. The track is stratified by strand, with '+' strand genes in blue and '-' strand genes in red. Text labels identify gene names, with exon regions highlighted by larger rectangles. The axis is divided by genomic intervals, accurately representing genomic features within the specified chromosome range.
