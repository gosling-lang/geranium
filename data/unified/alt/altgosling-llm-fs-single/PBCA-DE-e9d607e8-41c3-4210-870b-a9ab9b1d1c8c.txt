The visualization comprises a circular and a linear view arranged vertically. The circular view uses a blue brush to highlight chromosome 1, while the linear view corresponds to this highlighted region. The circular view features an ideogram, putative driver annotations, and three range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' in blue, 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange, and a connection track visualizing structural variations like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.'

The linear view extends these representations with additional details. It includes an ideogram, gene annotations, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation,' and tracks for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' shown as yellow and green rectangles. The 'Copy Number Variants' track displays gray rectangles indicating genomic ranges. Various colors in the scatter plot and connection track differentiate data types like 'C>A' mutations and structural variations, providing a comprehensive genomic overview.
