The visualization presents a circular plot representing genomic data, focusing on chromosome 12, spanning the interval from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The layout features stratified rows, each corresponding to different samples. Various points within these rows indicate quantitative expression values, plotted as peaks. The scatter plot uses color to differentiate between categories, with an opacity variation to suggest density or value ranges. The chart is based on a multivec file and designed to facilitate the perception of multiple time series data, referencing Javed et al.'s study on graphical perception from TVCG 2010.
