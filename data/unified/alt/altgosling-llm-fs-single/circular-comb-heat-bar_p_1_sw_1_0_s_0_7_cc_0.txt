The visualization presents two tracks in a circular layout, each representing genomic data from chromosome 1 spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The left track is a circular, multi-row bar chart, where bars display the 'peak' values stratified by 'sample' categories, identified as 'sample 1' to 'sample 4.' Colors like blue, orange, green, and red encode these categories. The right track is a circular heatmap, showing the same genomic region with 'peak' values encoded by color intensity, forming a gradient from light to dark corresponding to the data value. Both tracks allow tooltip interactions revealing detailed genomic positions and category information, enhancing the analysis of expressed data across samples.
