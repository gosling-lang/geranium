The visualization titled "Example: Overlay Tracks" features a linear layout depicting genomic data from chromosome 3. It includes overlay tracks with bars and points. The x-axis represents genomic positions while the y-axis indicates significance categories. The categories, such as "Pathogenic," "Likely pathogenic," "Uncertain significance," among others, are distinguished by colors and bar strokes, ranging from orange and black to green. Each point's color reflects its category, enhancing the visual differentiation. The dataset is sourced from a BEDDB file. The chart's width is 672 pixels, and height is 170 pixels.
