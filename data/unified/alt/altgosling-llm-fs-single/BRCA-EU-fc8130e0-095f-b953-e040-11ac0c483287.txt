A circular and linear visualization aligned vertically. The circular view includes a genome ideogram, showcasing various chromosomes with interactive elements linking to the linear view. This circular chart features tracks such as a point annotation titled 'Putative Driver' in text, two range annotation tracks displaying regions titled 'Gain' in blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange, and connections representing structural variations like 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' and 'Inversion.' 

The linear view expands on chromosome 1, detailing annotation tracks. It includes ideograms, a gene annotation track with triangular markers for gene direction, and a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' showing mutation distances with colored points indicating different mutation types. Additional tracks depict 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' events in rectangles, and a range annotation titled 'Copy Number Variants' in gray, highlighting quantitative data values. All these tracks together provide a comprehensive genomic visualization using CSV and VCF data types.
