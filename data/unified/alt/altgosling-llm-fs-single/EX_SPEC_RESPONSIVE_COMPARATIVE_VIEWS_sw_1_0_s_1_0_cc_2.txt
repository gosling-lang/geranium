The visualization displays three bar charts in a horizontal arrangement, illustrating data from a multivec file. Each chart represents genomic intervals on the x-axis, with expression values shown on the y-axis. The left chart displays chromosome 12 data between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000 using green bars. The middle chart presents chromosome 9 data in the same interval, represented by sky blue bars. The right chart returns to chromosome 12 for the same range but uses purple bars. The layout is linear, and each chart is interactively linked by a shared linking ID. The charts include features such as color encoding for visibility, and white strokes outline each bar to enhance contrast against the background.
