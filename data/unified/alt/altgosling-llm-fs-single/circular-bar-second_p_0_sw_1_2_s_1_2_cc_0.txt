The visualization is a circular bar chart displaying genomic data from a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The chart is arranged vertically with a center radius of 0.5 and remains static. Each track corresponds to a sample, including 'sample 1' to 'sample 4', represented in distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red respectively. The x-axis indicates genomic positions, while the y-axis represents expression values depicted through bars. Rows categorize samples, and a legend is provided to identify each sample. The tooltip offers genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample names, enhancing data interactivity.
