The visualization titled "Visual Linking" showcases a dynamic genome data representation with two main sections: a circular and a linear arrangement. The top section features two views aligned horizontally: a circular bar chart on the left and a linear bar chart on the right, both showing genomic data from chromosome 1. Each track is colored differently based on the 'sample' category, with bars indicating expression values on the y-axis. The circular chart utilizes a brush tool on the x-axis, linking both views and allowing for interactivity with the detailed linear view below. This detailed linear view focuses on chromosome 1 from intervals 160,000,000 to 200,000,000, using another bar chart that adjusts according to the brush position. Data is retrieved from a multivec file, visualizing quantitative peak values across four sample categories, enhancing genomic exploration and comparison.
