The visualization is a circular layout heatmap that represents genomic data for chromosome 1 across the interval of 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. The heatmap encodes expression values through color intensity, with darker shades indicating lower values and brighter shades indicating higher values. The chart includes four categories, represented by rows labeled 'sample 1' to 'sample 4.' This stratification allows for easy comparison among different samples. The visual elements include color legends and genomic positions as tooltips, enhancing data interactivity and interpretation. The layout is centered with a radius that visually balances the circular display, and the static arrangement ensures consistent analysis across views. The title of the visualization is "Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts," with a subtitle "Heatmap."
