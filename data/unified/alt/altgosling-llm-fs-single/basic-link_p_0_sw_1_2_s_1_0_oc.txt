The image displays a linear layout with a series of arcs illustrating genomic connections on chromosome 1. The visualization uses a CSV dataset with genomic fields "s1", "e1", "s2", and "e2" to represent start and end points of these connections. The arcs are depicted in steelblue, linking two regions on the genome. The title is "Basic Marks: Link", and the subtitle is "Tutorial Examples," indicating an educational context. The x-axis shows genomic positions at intervals, helping to contextualize the connections visually.
