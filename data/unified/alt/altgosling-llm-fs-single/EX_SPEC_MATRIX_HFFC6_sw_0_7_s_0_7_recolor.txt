A detailed matrix visualization compares Micro-C and Hi-C for HFFc6 cells, focusing on chromosome 7 from 77,700,000 to 81,000,000. The layout is horizontal and includes multiple tracks. The first set of tracks, displayed vertically, features bar charts showing genomic intervals. These include HFFc6_H3K4me3 in purple and HFFc6_ATAC in dark green. An overlay track presents the HFFc6_CTCF data with orange bars, complemented by genomic position annotations using pink and green triangles for different strands. The Micro-C data is visualized in a matrix, where the color intensity encodes expression values on both axes.

The horizontal section is organized into two comparative views. Each view has similar bar charts and matrix tracks, enabling a direct comparison between Micro-C and Hi-C. In the Hi-C set of tracks, similar annotations and color schemes are used. Additional annotation tracks at the bottom visualize the Epilogos data, highlighting various chromatin states with distinct color codes. The genomic intervals are consistently displayed on all axes, and the visualization's title and subtitle provide context for the comparison.
