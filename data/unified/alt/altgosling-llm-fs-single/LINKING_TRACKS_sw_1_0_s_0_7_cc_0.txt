The visualization consists of two linear tracks displaying genomic data for chromosome 2. The top track is a line chart showing expression levels across three samples, labeled "sample 1," "sample 3," and "sample 4," with lines colored in blue, orange, and green, respectively. Each lineâ€™s color corresponds to a distinct sample category.

The bottom track is an area chart displaying the same expression data for "sample 1" and "sample 2," visualized as colored areas in blue and orange. Both tracks are stratified by categories on the x-axis, representing genomic positions, and utilize a consistent color scheme for indicating categories. The genomic data is obtained from a multivec file and visualized using quantitative scale encoding on the y-axis for expression values. The charts are interactive, allowing linking across the tracks through the genomic position.
