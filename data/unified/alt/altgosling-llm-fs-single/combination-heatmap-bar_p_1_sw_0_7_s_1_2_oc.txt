A genome visualization in a linear layout displays two tracks for chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The top track is a multi-row bar chart showing four samples, 'sample 1' to 'sample 4', with peaks plotted along the x-axis, colored uniquely for each sample. The bottom track is a heatmap where each row corresponds to one of the four samples, and expression levels are represented through color intensity. The data is sourced from a multivec file, and both tracks provide genomic positions as tooltips for detailed examination.
