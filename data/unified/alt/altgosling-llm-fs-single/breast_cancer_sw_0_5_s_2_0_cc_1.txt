The visualization is a linear layout encompassing five distinct tracks, focusing on chromosome 1 of the hg38 genome assembly. The first track is an ideogram presented as a linear chromosome band showcasing cytogenetic bands with color coding based on different stains. Right and left triangles represent centromeric regions. The second track illustrates genomic annotations distinguishing strands using blue and orange triangles indicating positive and negative strands, respectively. Two subsequent tracks depict copy number variations (CNVs) as purple rectangles, based on tumor data, highlighting losses and high-copy number gains. The final track is a connection diagram displaying structural variations, such as "tandem-duplication" and "translocation," using color-coded lines where categories are differentiated by both line color and stroke.
