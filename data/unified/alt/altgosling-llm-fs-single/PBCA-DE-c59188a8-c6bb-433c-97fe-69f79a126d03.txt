A circular and linear visualization of the hg19 genome features multiple tracks. The circular view includes an ideogram, a point annotation track titled "Putative Driver," and range annotation tracks for "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," displayed with blue and orange rectangles respectively. Connections between genomic positions are depicted with lines in various colors based on structural variations such as "Translocation" and "Duplication." The linear view, linked via a blue interactive brush, expands on chromosome 1, adding detailed annotation of point mutations, copy number variations, and gene information. The scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" displays genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, with points color-coded by mutation subtype. The setup highlights genomic variations and annotations collaboratively across circular and linear frameworks.
