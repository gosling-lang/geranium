The visualization consists of a circular layout with vertical arrangement and two primary tracks. The dataset focuses on chromosome 1, spanning a genomic interval from position 1 to 3,000,500. 

The left track is a circular bar chart displaying genomic data by sample categories, using rows for differentiation. Each category is represented by a distinct color: blue, orange, green, and red for 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'. The y-axis encodes expression levels with bars, while the x-axis represents genomic positions.

The right track is a circular heat map, displaying genomic intervals on the x-axis. Color intensity is used to encode expression values, creating a gradient from light to dark for low to high values. The chart is stratified by sample categories, enhancing the visual differentiation of data.

Both tracks are interactive, featuring tooltips that provide detailed information about genomic start and end positions, value, and sample. The layout is static, centering around a designated radius, and styled uniformly for consistent presentation.
