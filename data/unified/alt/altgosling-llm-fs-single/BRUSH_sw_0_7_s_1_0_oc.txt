The visualization features two linked line charts arranged in a linear layout. The charts depict genomic data from a multivec file, specifically for chromosome 1. The top chart, aligned with an interactive brush, spans the entire chromosome, allowing users to select a region. This selection is dynamically reflected in the bottom chart, focusing on a zoomed-in interval from 200,000,000 to 220,000,000 base pairs of chromosome 1. The expression values are plotted on the y-axis against genomic positions on the x-axis, emphasized by a steel blue background for selected areas. The visualization effectively illustrates the concept of brushing and linking, enhancing data exploration and comparison. The title of the visualization is "Example: Brushing and Linking."
