The visualization consists of three linear bar charts aligned horizontally, each displaying genomic data. The first chart represents chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000 with peaks shown in pink bars. The second chart displays chromosome 9 over the same interval, using purple bars for peak values. The third chart returns to chromosome 12, using green bars. Each chart illustrates genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis, maintaining a consistent structure with white stroke outlines and defined stroke width for clarity.
