A linear visualization comprises two panels arranged vertically, depicting multivec data across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top panel features a multicolored bar chart where genomic positions are on the x-axis, and peak values are on the y-axis, with the colors representing four samples. The y-axis includes a grid for better readability. The bottom panel is a scatter plot stratified by sample categories, displaying points where sizes correspond to quantitative peak values. The visualizations provide genomic intervals with interactive tooltips and legends that distinguish the sample categories.
