In a linear layout, this visualization leverages a CSV file to illustrate connections within chromosome 1 of the hg38 genome assembly. The arc representations, known as 'withinLink' marks, create links between specified genomic intervals (fields 's1' to 'e1' and 's2' to 'e2'). These connections are colored in steel blue. The visualization is titled 'Basic Marks: Link', with the subtitle 'Tutorial Examples'. The chart spans a width of 560 pixels and a height of 210 pixels, providing a clear depiction of genomic linkage across the chromosome.
