The visualization features a linear layout with two sections, each containing multiple genomic tracks and visualizations based on the human genome assembly hg38.

1. **Top Section:**
   - **Gene Annotation Track:** Displays genes on chromosome 17 between positions 200,000 and 800,000, marked by navy blue rectangles and lines, representing gene and exon regions.
   - **Expression Bar Charts:** Three bar charts showing expression levels (peaks) along genomic positions in shades of purple.
   - **Ideogram:** A genomic ideogram highlights the chromosomal bands with white rectangles and black outlines, featuring right and left triangles to indicate centromere regions. Overlayed with segmental duplication data in colored rectangles.

2. **Bottom Section:**
   - **Ideogram:** Similar genomic ideogram for chromosome 1, featuring centromere annotations.
   - **Segmental Duplications:** Colored rectangles show segmental duplications in the genomic context.
   - **Expression Bar Charts:** Three further bar charts displaying expression levels along chromosome 1 in shades of purple.
   - **Gene Annotation Track:** Displays genes on chromosome 1 between 109,000,000 and 112,000,000, marked similarly by navy blue rectangles and lines for gene and exon regions.

These views are arranged vertically, with consistent styling for color, size, and stroke width across tracks, enabling a detailed comparative analysis of genomic data along specified intervals.
