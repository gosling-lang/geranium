The visualization presents two main views: a circular view and a linear view, linked by a blue interactive brush. The circular view encapsulates the entire genome, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. The circular view includes an ideogram, a text-based annotation track for 'Putative Driver,' two range annotation tracks labeled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' and connection lines representing structural variations such as 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.' The linear view comprises multiple tracks, including an ideogram with triangles indicating centromeres, text annotations, vertical lines, and genomic range annotations. It also features a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation,' where points are colored based on mutation subtype, and a track for 'Copy Number Variants,' displaying quantitative data. Overall, the visualization employs diverse color schemes and shapes to denote different genomic data categories, enhancing interpretability and interactive exploration.
