The visualization presents two views: a focused and an overview alignment of genetic data. The focused view shows detailed information within the interval [350, 396], while the overview spans the entire range [0, 396]. It includes three bar tracks and one text track, all in a linear layout. The "Gap" track uses a pink bar chart to show gap values on the y-axis. The "Conservation" track utilizes a bar chart with a hot color scale to represent conservation scores. The main alignment track visualizes nucleotide sequences across various samples, using colored rectangles and black text to denote different bases. Overlays include visibility-driven text display based on zoom level. A brush tool in green enables interaction and linking between the focused and overview visualizations, facilitating detailed exploration of genomic alignments.
