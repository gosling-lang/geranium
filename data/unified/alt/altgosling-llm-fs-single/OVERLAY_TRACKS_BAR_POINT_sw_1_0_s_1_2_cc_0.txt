The visualization titled "Example: Overlay Tracks" showcases a linear genomic track using data from a BEDDB file, specifically focusing on chromosome 3. It features an overlay of bars and points, representing different categories of significance. The categories include 'Pathogenic,' 'Pathogenic/Likely_pathogenic,' 'Likely_pathogenic,' 'Uncertain_significance,' 'Likely_benign,' 'Benign/Likely_benign,' and 'Benign,' each distinguished by unique colors ranging from orange to green. The x-axis displays genomic positions, while the y-axis categorizes the significance levels with a baseline at 'Uncertain_significance.' Bars are outlined with categories and points are color-coded, enhancing the clarity of data presentation. The visualization's width is 960 pixels, with a height of 270 pixels, and it supports interactive exploration with a top-axis axis for genomic coordinates.
