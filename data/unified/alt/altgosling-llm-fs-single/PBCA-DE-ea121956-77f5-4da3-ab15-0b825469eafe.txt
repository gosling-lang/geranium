A comprehensive genomic visualization displays a circular ideogram linked to a linear view of chromosome 1. The circular layout presents multiple tracks, including an ideogram, putative driver genes, gain and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events, and structural variant connections, with each category visualized in distinct colors like blue for 'Gain' and orange for 'LOH.' A blue interactive brush links the circular view to the linear representation below. In the linear section, detailed tracks illustrate point mutations, insertions, deletions, and copy number variations, providing a zoomed focus on specific genomic regions of chromosome 1. The visualization effectively integrates CSV and VCF data to highlight genomic variations and structural changes.
