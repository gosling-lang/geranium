The visualization overlays various genomic tracks in a linear layout focusing on chromosome 1. It begins with an ideogram, which uses colored rectangles to represent different banding patterns on the chromosome. The subsequent track annotates genomic positions with triangles indicating gene orientation: blue for the positive strand and orange for the negative. Two tracks follow, displaying copy number variations (CNV) using rectangles; sky blue denotes regions with a minor copy number of zero, while pink indicates high total copy numbers in tumors. The final track, employing curved connections, illustrates structural variations like tandem duplications and translocations. Different colors and strokes highlight categories such as tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions, providing a comprehensive view of genomic alterations.
