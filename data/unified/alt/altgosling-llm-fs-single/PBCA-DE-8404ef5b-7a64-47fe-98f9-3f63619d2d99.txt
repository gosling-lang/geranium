A circular and linear visualization representing genomic data from hg19 shows comprehensive insights into somatic mutations. The circular view features an ideogram, annotated with 'Gain' in blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange. It includes tracks for structural variants, such as 'Translocation' and 'Duplication,' revealed through color-coded connections.

The linear view zooms into chromosome 1, displaying similar data layers. It features text annotations for 'Putative Driver' genes. The 'Point Mutation' scatter plot uses VCF data, with point color indicating mutation subtypes. Additional tracks illustrate 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' variants. The bar chart titled 'Copy Number Variants' uses CSV data, where bar height reflects quantitative copy number changes. A blue brush in the circular view links the two perspectives, highlighting dynamic genomic regions for detailed analysis.
