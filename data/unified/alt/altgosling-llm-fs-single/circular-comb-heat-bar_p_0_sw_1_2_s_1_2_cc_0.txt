A circular multi-track visualization displays genomic data from chromosome 1, covering a range from 1 to 3,000,500. On the left, a heat map encodes expression values using color intensity, stratified by rows for categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4,' showcasing variations in color hue. The right features a concentric bar chart, where the height of bars represents quantitative expression data across the same samples. Each track is stratified by categories, with a distinct color assigned to each sample: blue, orange, green, and red. Tooltip functionality provides additional genomic position details and expression values. This visualization emphasizes comparative visual encoding of genomic datasets in a static circular arrangement.
