A dual-track visualization in a linear layout consists of scatter plots representing multivec data from chromosome 1, ranging from base 1 to 3,000,500. The first track displays a genome-wide overview of expression peaks with point sizes proportional to peak values. The second track stratifies samples into four rows, coloring by category: blue, orange, green, and red. Each track includes genomic position tooltips and point opacity set to 0.5 for enhanced visibility within dense regions.
