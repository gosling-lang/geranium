This visualization features a comprehensive genomic analysis in a split view, combining a circular and a linear layout. The circular view displays a complete genome ideogram with various tracks. These include a point annotation track labeled "Putative Driver," and two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" with distinct blue and orange rectangles. Additionally, a line-connection track visualizes structural variations such as Translocations, Duplications, and Deletions, color-coded by type.

The linear view beneath shows a focused region of chromosome 1, linked to the circular view by an interactive blue brush. This view includes a detailed ideogram, text annotations for potential drivers, and several analysis tracks. These cover point mutations from VCF files and range annotations for CNVs and InDels. The "Point Mutation" scatter plot employs various colors to denote nucleotide substitutions, while CNVs are shown in gray and range annotations are depicted overlapping with previous tracks.

Both views facilitate comprehensive exploration of genomic data, with interactive elements for detailed inspection of genomic variations across the analyzed chromosome.
