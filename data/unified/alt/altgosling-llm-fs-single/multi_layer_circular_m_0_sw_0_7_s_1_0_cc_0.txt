A circular scatter plot visualizes genomic data from chromosome 12, specifically between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. Each point represents a data category named 'sample,' with categories from 'sample 1' to 'sample 16,' excluding 'sample -'. The chart is divided into multiple circular layers, stratified by 'sample' categories, with points colored in a variety of shades including blue, orange, green, red, purple, and brown. Points are organized based on a 'peak' field, a quantitative measure, with differing opacities across layers.
