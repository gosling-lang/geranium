A circular ideogram visualization displays genomic data across multiple chromosomes using the hg38 assembly. The outermost track highlights chromosome regions with color-coded categories such as 'gneg', 'gpos25', and others. The second track depicts genomic intervals with sky blue rectangles, filtered by 'minor_cn_tumor' values from a CSV file. A third track illustrates genomic regions in purple rectangles, representing 'total_cn_tumor' values. The innermost track showcases genomic rearrangements with connections between positions, colored and stroked based on the 'svclass' categories like 'tandem-duplication' and 'translocation'.
