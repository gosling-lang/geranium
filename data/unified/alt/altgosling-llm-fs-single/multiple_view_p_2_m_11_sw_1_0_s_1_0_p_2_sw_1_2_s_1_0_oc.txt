The visualization titled "Visual Linking" features an interactive layout to explore genomic data across chromosome 1. It is arranged vertically, with a circular and a linear view aligned horizontally. The top section includes a circular line chart and an area chart displaying genomic intervals on the x-axis with expression values represented by lines and areas. Both charts are stratified by rows and color-coded to reflect the categories: sample 1 through sample 4, which link to the detailed view below.

The lower section presents a detailed linear scatter plot focusing on chromosome 1 regions between 160,000,000 and 200,000,000. Each point is colored based on the same samples, showing expression levels along the y-axis. The views are connected via interactive brushes, allowing users to adjust and navigate the genomic intervals shown. The data is derived from a multivec file focusing on genomic position and peak values.
