The visualization consists of an overlaid matrix representing genomic data for chromosome 10. Two matrix tracks are presented in a horizontal arrangement, each depicted as a square plot. The first track uses a grey color scale to encode quantitative values, while the second uses a pink color scale. Both tracks show genomic intervals on the x- and y-axes, representing different regions of chromosome 10. The expression values are indicated by color intensity, with legends provided for color interpretation. The layout is responsive to the width, adapting its display for screens wider than 1000 pixels. The matrices are part of the HG38 assembly and utilize overlay alignment to enhance comparative analysis. The linkingId ensures cohesive interaction between the visual components.
