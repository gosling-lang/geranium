The visualization is a genomic heatmap focusing on chromosome 10, presented in a linear layout with an overlay of matrices. It features two tracks, each displaying data utilizing a matrix format. The x- and y-axes represent genomic intervals. The first track visualizes data with color intensity in the 'hot' range and is positioned in the lower-left matrix extent. The second track also uses color intensity, within the 'pink' range, and is overlaid in the upper-right matrix extent. Both tracks depict quantitative expression values encoded by color, and include interactive legends for interpretation. The arrangement aligns horizontally, allowing for comparative analysis across two matrix views.
