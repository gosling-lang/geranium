A circular visualization displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500, is structured into several layers. Each layer represents different samples (sample 1 to sample 4) characterized by colored lines and corresponding points. Line charts and scatter plots illustrate quantitative data fields named 'peak' along the genomic position axis. Points indicate expression values with varying sizes. The chart employs distinct colors for different samples—blue, orange, green, and red—facilitating category differentiation. The assembly used is hg38, with a static layout maintaining a centered radial design.
