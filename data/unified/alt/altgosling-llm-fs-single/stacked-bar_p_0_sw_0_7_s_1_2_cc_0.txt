A vertical bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, displaying chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. Each bar represents expression data, categorized and colored based on four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', using a color range including blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis represents genomic position, and the y-axis shows quantitative expression values with grid lines for easy comparison. Tooltips provide additional information, including start and end genomic positions, peak values, and sample names.
