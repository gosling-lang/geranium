A linear visualization of genomic data for chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500, is arranged vertically. It includes three views: a line and scatter plot, an area chart, and a bar chart. Each view displays data from four samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4'). The line and scatter plot uses lines and points to show expression values on the y-axis, with point sizes varying by expression value. The area chart shows expression as filled areas, and the bar chart presents expression using bars. Categories are distinguished by color. Interactive tooltips provide genomic positions and expression values.
