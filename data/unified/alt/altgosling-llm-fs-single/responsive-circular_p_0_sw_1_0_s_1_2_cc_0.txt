A circular bar chart visualizes genomic data from chromosome 12, spanning positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The chart displays multiple categories, represented as rows, each indicated by a different color within the circular layout. The outermost category corresponds to 'sample 1', progressing inward through 'sample 16'. Data is expressed as peaks on the y-axis, with varying opacity based on peak values. Legends are provided for peak domains, indicating different visibility conditions. The visualization uses a multivec file, applying filters to exclude specific samples and adjusting its layout responsively between circular and linear depending on the aspect ratio.
