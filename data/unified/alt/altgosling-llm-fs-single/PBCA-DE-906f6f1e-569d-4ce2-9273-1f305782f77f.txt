The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view arranged vertically. The circular view displays an ideogram of the entire human genome (hg19) with a blue interactive brush that links to the linear view. The circular view includes multiple tracks: an ideogram, a text annotation track titled "Putative Driver" displaying gene annotations, two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" with genomic regions highlighted in blue and orange respectively, and a line-connection track showing structural variations with lines colored by categories such as 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion (TtT/HH).' The linear view focuses on chromosome 1. It replicates the tracks from the circular view and includes a genomic range annotation track, a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" plotting VCF data by mutation subtype, a track displaying copy number variants as bars, and additional annotation for insertions and deletions. The views are linked to allow interaction and detailed exploration of data across different genomic regions.
