The visualization titled "Visual Linking" features an interactive genomic data display focusing on chromosome 1. In a vertical arrangement, the top section includes a horizontal array of charts: a linear area chart and a static circular line chart. Both charts showcase genomic intervals on the x-axis and quantitative expression values for four samples on the y-axis, each sample distinguished by a unique color. These charts include an overlay with interactive brush elements, linking their detailed view on the bottom.

The bottom section presents a detailed linear scatter plot, centered on a specific genomic interval of chromosome 1 (160,000,000 to 200,000,000). In this layout, each point in the scatter plot corresponds to the 'peak' value from the data, with colors delineating different samples. This enables dynamic exploration and analysis of the genomic data, as the brush interaction allows users to adjust the view and explore different genomic regions and sample comparisons. The subtitle guides users to manipulate the brushes to update the detailed view dynamically.
