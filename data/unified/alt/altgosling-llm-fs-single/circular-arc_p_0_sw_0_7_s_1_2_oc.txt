The visualization is a circular genomic chart showing connections within chromosome 1, ranging from positions 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. The chart uses a vertical arrangement and static layout. Connections are colored differently based on the genomic position 's1,' indicating various categories. The lines, which represent duplicated segments, are outlined in black with a stroke width of 0.5 and an opacity of 0.2. The visualization provides an overview of segmental duplications within the specified genomic interval, using a circular tracks system to highlight the structural variations.
