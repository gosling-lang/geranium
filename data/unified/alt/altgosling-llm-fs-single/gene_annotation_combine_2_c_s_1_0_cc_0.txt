The visualization consists of two horizontally arranged genomic range annotation tracks titled "HiGlass" and "Cyverse-QUBES," focusing on chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. Both tracks display gene structures using various shapes and colors to indicate different genomic elements and strands. In the "HiGlass" track, right-pointing triangles represent the positive strand, colored in blue, while left-pointing triangles indicate the negative strand, colored in orange. Text labels identify gene names, such as "PBRM1." The "Cyverse-QUBES" track employs a similar layout with additional colors: pink text, sky blue right-pointing triangles, green left-pointing triangles, purple rectangles, and sky-blue lines to depict genomic features, such as exons. Rows are stratified based on the strand, with each visual element and gene accurately mapped to corresponding genomic positions.
