A circular area chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying data for chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart features multiple rows, each representing a different sample category, including 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 6', 'sample 7', and 'sample 8.' The genomic positions are shown around the circular layout, and the peak values are represented by the area size. Each sample is color-coded, with a palette including blue, orange, green, red, purple, and brown. The chart is segmented into distinct categories based on the 'sample' field, with visual separation between the bands.
