A set of interactive genomic tracks visualizes a multivec file across chromosomes 1 and 3. This visualization features multiple bar charts and a genomic range annotation track, each with customizable mouse events. 

The bar charts depict genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. They are colored according to different categories such as 'sample' or 'genomic position.' The charts include tracks titled 'Individual Marks,' 'Group Marks By Sample,' and 'Group Marks By Genomic Position,' showing interactive regions that respond to mouseover and selection, with colors changing dynamically to blue, red, and other specified hues.

Additionally, a genomic range annotation track titled 'Group Marks By Gene' highlights intervals on chromosome 3, displayed with text, rectangles, and directional triangles indicating gene orientation. Interactive styles modify the appearance during mouse events, with changes in arrangement and color.

An ideogram titled 'Group Marks By Chromosome' provides an overview of regions along chromosome 1, with visible banding patterns colored by density and acentromere specified by red triangles.

The title 'Custom Mouse Events' and subtitle emphasize the focus on tailored interactions, facilitating detailed exploration of these genomic datasets.
