A linear heat map visualization of chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500 is displayed in a vertical arrangement. The data, sourced from a multivec file, is stratified into four sample categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is represented in distinct horizontal bands. Genomic positions are mapped on the x-axis, with heat intensity encoding the 'peak' values. The color scale ranges from light to dark based on quantitative values of 'peak', depicted in a legend on the right. The chart offers tooltip interactions revealing genomic start and end positions, precise 'peak' values, and the specific sample category.
