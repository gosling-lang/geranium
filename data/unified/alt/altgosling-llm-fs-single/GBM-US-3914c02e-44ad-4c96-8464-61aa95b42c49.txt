This visualization presents a dual layout consisting of a circular ideogram view and a linear genomic view. The circular view includes five tracks showcasing genome-wide information, such as an ideogram, point annotations, genomic range annotations indicating 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' and line connections. Each track is differentiated by color: sky blue for gains and dark orange for LOH. The connections between genomic positions are categorized into 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion' using color codes.

The linear view, aligned to chromosome 1, further details the genomic data with an ideogram, text annotations for 'Putative Driver' genes, and tracks for point mutations, insertions, deletions, and copy number variations. A scatter plot named 'Point Mutation' visualizes distances to previous mutations, with points colored by mutation subtype. Rectangles in range annotation tracks indicate 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' events, while bars represent 'Copy Number Variants.' The linking mechanism between the circular and linear views enhances interactive exploration, offering a comprehensive genomic data analysis.
