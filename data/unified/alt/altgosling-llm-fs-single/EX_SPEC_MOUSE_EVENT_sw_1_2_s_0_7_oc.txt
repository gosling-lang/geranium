A vertically arranged series of tracks displays genomic data with customizable mouse interactions. The visualization is titled "Custom Mouse Events" with a subtitle on customizing mouse hover and range selection events. Tracks include:

1. **Individual Marks**: A linear bar chart for chromosome 1, highlighting samples in different colors.
2. **Group Marks By Sample**: Similar layout, but bars group by sample. Mouse hover changes color to blue, selections to red, and brush selections to green.
3. **Group Marks By Genomic Position**: Focuses on genomic positions, using mouse interactions to group marks by position.
4. **Group Marks By Gene**: Displays gene annotations with text, including mouse events grouping by name.
5. **Group Marks By Chromosome**: Features an ideogram with text and rectangles, showing genomic bands across chromosomes. Hover turns elements blue, selections red.

Overall, this visualization supports dynamic exploration of genomic data with interactive grouping and selection features.
