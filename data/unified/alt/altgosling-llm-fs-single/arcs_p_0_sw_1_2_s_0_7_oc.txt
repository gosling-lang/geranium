The visualization titled "Visual Encoding" with the subtitle "Arcs" is a linear layout depiction showing genomic data from chromosome 1, in an interval ranging from 1 to 3,000,500. The chart features a series of colorful arcs, which connect different genomic positions along the x-axis. These connections are represented with varied colors, each indicating different categories derived from the genomic field 's1'. The arcs are drawn with a transparency set at 0.2, and are outlined in black with a stroke width of 0.5. The chart's data is sourced from a CSV file located at a specified URL, focusing on fields such as 's1', 'e1', 's2', 'e2', and 'c2'. The visualization showcases genomic positions between 103,900,000 and 104,100,000 on chromosome 1, offering visual insights into the linked genomic intervals.
