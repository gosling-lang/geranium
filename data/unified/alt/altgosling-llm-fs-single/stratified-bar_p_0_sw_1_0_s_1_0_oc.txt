The visualization is a multi-row bar chart with a linear layout, displaying a multivec file that spans chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. It showcases four rows labeled 'sample 1' through 'sample 4,' each distinguished by a different color. The height of each bar in the chart represents quantitative peak values, while the x-axis corresponds to genomic positions. This visualization includes an interactive legend to identify categories, and tooltips provide genomic start and end positions as well as peak values for detailing.
