The visualization is a composite chart featuring two tracks in a linear arrangement along chromosome 1, ranging from 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. The top track is a scatter plot where genomic positions along the x-axis are represented as points. Each point's y-position and size are determined by quantitative peak values, indicating expression levels. The colors of the points distinguish between four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', with an opacity setting of 0.5 for visual clarity. Tooltips provide detailed genomic and quantitative information.

Below the scatter plot, the second track displays an area chart stratified into rows for each sample category. The y-axis represents the peak values as continuous areas, with distinct colors for each category, further outlined in white with a stroke width of 0.5. Both tracks share a genomic axis along the top, ensuring alignment and coherence in visualizing the chromosomal data.
