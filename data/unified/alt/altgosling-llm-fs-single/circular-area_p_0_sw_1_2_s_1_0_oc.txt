The visualization is a circular area chart depicting genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The chart is organized in a vertical arrangement with a center radius of 0.5, using an area mark to represent quantitative 'peak' values across different 'sample' categories. The samples, which include 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', are distinguished by color: yellow, green, blue, and pink, respectively. The x-axis represents genomic positions while the y-axis encodes 'peak' values. Each sample's data is displayed on separate rows, and a legend is provided for sample identification. The visualization is static and optimized for visual clarity with a white stroke and a stroke width of 0.5, facilitating easy comparison of data across samples.
