The visualization consists of two vertically arranged tracks in a linear layout. The top track is a multi-row bar chart displaying a genomic range from chromosome 1, position 1 to 3,000,500. It stratifies data by categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each category is represented by a distinct color, with the peak values plotted on the y-axis. The bottom track is a heat map of the same genomic range, encoding expression values with color intensity. Both tracks provide interactive tooltips detailing start and end genomic positions, peak values, and sample information. The overall layout centers on an hg38 genomic assembly, allowing interactive exploration of data spanning genomic intervals.
