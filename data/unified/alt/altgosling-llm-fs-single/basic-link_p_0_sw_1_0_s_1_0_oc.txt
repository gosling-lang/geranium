A linear visualization titled "Basic Marks: Link" with subtitle "Tutorial Examples" displays genomic data connections on chromosome 1. The visualization uses a CSV dataset and showcases arcs indicating links between genomic positions, using steel blue strokes. The x-axis represents genomic intervals, and links span across different genomic regions, providing a comprehensive view of segmental duplications or structural variations. The layout is structured linearly, providing clear visual representation of data relationships on a genomic scale.
