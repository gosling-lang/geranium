The visualization comprises a circular view and a linear view stacked vertically, using hg19 assembly data. A circular ideogram at the top features a blue interactive brush linking it to the linear view, representing chromosome 1. This circular view includes "Putative Driver" text annotations, "Gain" ranges in blue rectangles, "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in orange rectangles, and structural variant connections colored by 'svclass', which includes categories like 'Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and various inversions.

The linear view adopts a vertical arrangement, showing chromosome 1 in detail. It includes an ideogram with accompanying text tracks, one chart with point annotations for "Point Mutation" visualized from VCF files, colored by mutation subtypes. Rows like 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' highlight genomic variations with colored rectangles. The "Copy Number Variants" track presents quantitative data using gray bars. Mouseover interactions and tooltip functionalities enhance data exploration capabilities across the visualizations.
