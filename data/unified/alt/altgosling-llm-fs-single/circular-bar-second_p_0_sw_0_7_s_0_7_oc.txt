A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec dataset, focusing on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. This chart is structured with four horizontal arrangement views, displayed as rows representing 'sample 1' to 'sample 4.' Each row displays bars to represent expression data ('peak') for the respective sample, with colors indicating categories. The circular layout uses a vertical arrangement, and each bar is annotated with genomic positions and peak values, providing tooltip interactions for detailed data insight. The assembly is hg38, and the entire visualization is static with no zoom interaction.
