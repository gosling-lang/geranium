A vertical linear visualization on chromosome 1, spanning positions from 1 to 3,000,500, comprising three distinct tracks. The first track is a multi-row bar chart, displaying genomic intervals on the x-axis and quantitative expression values on the y and ye-axes. Each row represents a distinct sample, categorized by color: blue, orange, green, and red for samples 1 to 4. The second track overlays line and point marks, illustrating continuous expression values along the x-axis and showcasing variation with line plots and point sizes for sample stratification. The third track presents a scatter plot, using point size and color to encode sample-specific expression data, with points distributed horizontally by genomic position. Tooltips indicate detailed information such as position and value ranges.
