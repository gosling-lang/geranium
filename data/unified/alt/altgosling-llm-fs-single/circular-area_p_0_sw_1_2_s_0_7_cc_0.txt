A circular area chart displays genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The data is categorized into four sample groups: 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' Each sample is represented by a distinct color: blue, orange, green, and red. The chart's layout is circular with a vertical arrangement of categories distinguished by row positioning. The expression level or 'peak' is displayed along the y-axis, with a smooth white stroke outlining each area section. The visual includes interactive tooltips that detail start and end genomic positions as well as peak values for each sample.
