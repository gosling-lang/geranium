A circular visualization displays genomic data from chromosome 1, covering positions 1 to 3,000,500. The circular view contains an overlay of line and scatter plots, with expression values represented by both lines and points. The layout is static and vertically aligned. The data is categorized into four samples, color-coded in blue, orange, green, and red. Each row corresponds to a sample, showing its respective peak values. Points vary in size according to quantitative peak measurements. The visualization is interactive, including tooltips that provide genomic positions, peak values, and sample identifiers. The assembly used is hg38.
