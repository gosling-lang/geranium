A circular bar chart in a circular layout visualizes multivec data, showing chromosome 1 ranging from base 1 to 3,000,500. The bars represent quantitative 'peak' values across four samples, namely 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4.' Each sample is color-coded with distinct colorsâ€”blue for 'sample 1', orange for 'sample 2', green for 'sample 3', and red for 'sample 4.' The x-axis is genomic, and the y-axis depicts quantitative values. Tooltips provide detailed genomic and sample-specific information. The chart is static with interactive elements like legends for categorical identification.
