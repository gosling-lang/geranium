The image shows a genome visualization comprising two tracks arranged vertically in a linear layout, focusing on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. 

The top track is a scatter plot with additional area marks, showing genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis across four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is displayed in distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The points and areas encode the 'peak' value, with rows stratified by sample names.

The bottom track presents a line chart, with the same genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Lines indicate expression trends for each sample, colored similarly to the top track, with a grid enhancing readability. The visualization highlights variations in genomic data across different samples using vivid color coding and layered data representation.
