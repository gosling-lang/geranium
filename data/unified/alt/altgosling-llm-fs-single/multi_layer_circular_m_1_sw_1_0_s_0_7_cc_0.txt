A circular line chart visualizes a multivec file over chromosome 12, covering the interval from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. It employs a layout that stratifies the data into rows by sample categories, each depicted with distinct line colors. The chart uses multiple layers to show data at different opacity levels, highlighting various domains of quantitative data ('peak') on the y-axis without explicit numerical axis labels. This allows for an exploration of data trends and variations within specified genomic intervals, inspired by the concept of multiple time series as referenced by Javed et al. in 2010.
