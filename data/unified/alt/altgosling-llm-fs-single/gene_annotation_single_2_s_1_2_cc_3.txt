The visualization displays a genomic range annotation track titled 'IGV' in a linear layout. It focuses on chromosome 3, ranging from 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. The track includes gene annotations with names displayed as text and genomic ranges represented by green rectangles. The track differentiates forward and reverse strands using white triangular patterns on rules, pointing left and right. The chart is stratified by rows based on strand types ('+' and '-').
