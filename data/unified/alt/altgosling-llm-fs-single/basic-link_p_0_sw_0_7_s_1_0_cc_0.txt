A linear visualization titled "Basic Marks: Link" represents genomic link connections using a CSV file. The chart, focusing on chromosome 1, depicts arcs connecting specified start and end genomic positions. The arcs are colored in light red. The layout is linear, designed for tutorial purposes, with the genome displayed in intervals along the x-axis. The size is 560x210, defined through attributes in the specification.
