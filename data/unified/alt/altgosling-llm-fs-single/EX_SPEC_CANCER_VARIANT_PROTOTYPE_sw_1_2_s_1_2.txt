A visualization titled "Breast Cancer Variant (Staaf et al. 2019)" displays genetic characteristics of RAD51C- and PALB2-altered TNBCs using a linear and circular layout. The circular view includes five tracks: an ideogram, annotated genomic ranges for "Putative Driver," "LOH" in dark orange, "Gain" in green, and a "Structural Variant" with connections representing SV categories like tandem-duplication, translocation, deletion, and inversion. These categories are color-coded with a legend indicating different SV classes. 

The linear view provides a detailed look at chromosome 1, with an ideogram and text annotations for gene names and genomic ranges. Tracks for "Putative Driver," "LOH," "Gain," and "Structural Variant" are also presented with color consistency to the circular view. Two additional views use example BAM data to reveal genomic coverage and pileup, with gray bars showing coverage and colored rectangles depicting various structural variations, detailed by a comprehensive legend. The visualization uses interactive brushes linking the circular and linear views, enhancing data exploration by connecting different genomic datasets across layouts.
