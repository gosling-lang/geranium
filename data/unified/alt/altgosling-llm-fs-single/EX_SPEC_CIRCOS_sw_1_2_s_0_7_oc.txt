The visualization is a circular layout titled "Circos," showcasing genomic data. It features three layers: a circular bar chart, an ideogram, and a chart with connections. The bar chart uses a multivec file to display genomic positions and expression values, colored in light yellow. The ideogram shows chromosome bands with categories represented in various grayscale shades and light colors. The connection chart displays links across genomic regions with strokes in diverse colors, illustrating different chromosomal connections. The visualization is interactive, with a radial arrangement and consistent spacing, emphasizing structural genomic insights.
