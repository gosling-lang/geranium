The visualization is an overlaid heatmap matrix depicting genomic interactions on chromosome 10. The layout is horizontal, comprising two overlapped tracks, one in the lower-left and another in the upper-right quadrant. Each matrix uses a color gradient to encode quantitative genomic interaction values, with the lower-left matrix using the "viridis" color range and the upper-right matrix employing a grey scale. The heatmap axes correspond to genomic intervals on chromosome 10, showcasing dense interaction patterns through color intensity. Enhanced interactivity is indicated by a common linking ID and responsive width adjustments, offering dynamic resizing based on the visualization context. The genome is displayed on both the x- and y-axes, providing a detailed correlation view of genomic data.
