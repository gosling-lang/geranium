This visualization is a linear, vertically arranged set of bar charts displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. It represents data from a multivec file, showing four samples identified as "sample 1," "sample 2," "sample 3," and "sample 4." The top track features an overlay of bars colored in different hues: blue, orange, green, and red, corresponding to each sample. These bars are stratified by rows, indicating expression levels on the y-axis and genomic positions on the x-axis. The bottom track showcases a combined view with stacked bars, using the same color scheme across samples, adding size as an additional encoding dimension. Each track includes a tooltip that provides genomic position, expression value, and sample information. This genomic range representation facilitates a comparative analysis of expression peaks across the samples.
