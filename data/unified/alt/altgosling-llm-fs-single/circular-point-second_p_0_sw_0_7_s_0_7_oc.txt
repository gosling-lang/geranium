A circular scatter plot visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500. Points represent genomic positions and expression values, encoded in size. There are four samples, each depicted in distinct colors: yellow, green, blue, and pink. The opacity of points is set at 0.5, and the plot features a legend to identify categories. The orientation is horizontal and static, with a vertical arrangement.
