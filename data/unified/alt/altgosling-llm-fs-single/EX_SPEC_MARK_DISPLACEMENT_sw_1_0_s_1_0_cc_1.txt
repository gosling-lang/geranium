The visualization titled "Mark Displacement" uses displacement options to address visual overlaps. It consists of multiple genomic tracks arranged linearly, showcasing data from the hg38 assembly. The first track depicts 15 rows of transcripts along chromosome 3, highlighted with directional arrows in blue and orange indicating gene orientation. Text labels identify genes alongside exonic regions rendered as rectangles. The subsequent track, titled "Likely Benign," spans chromosome 2, displaying genomic intervals using points and text. It features connections to annotate relationships, color-coded for clarity. The final track presents data on chromosome 17 with points colored based on pathological significance, illustrating variations in genetic makeup with a focus on pathogenic categories. Marks like triangles and rectangles enhance the visual encoding of strand direction and gene structure, providing a detailed genomic map designed to reduce overlaps through strategic displacement.
