The visualization presents linear genomic tracks with complex displacement and layering techniques to resolve overlapping data points. It includes three main components:

1. **Transcription Annotation**: Displays transcript data of chromosome 3 from 142,500,000 to 143,000,000 base pairs using triangular arrows to indicate gene direction. Displacement is used to stack a maximum of 15 gene annotations vertically, distinguished by color: blue for positive strand and orange for negative strand.

2. **ClinVar Variants**: Illustrates clinically significant variants marked as "Likely Benign" on chromosome 2 between 126,800,000 and 127,700,000 base pairs. Green points represent variant locations, overlaid with colored text showing base changes. Light gray links connect related genomic sites.

3. **Variant Analysis**: Details pathogenic variants on chromosome 17, from 43,080,000 to 43,120,000 base pairs. Points are colored based on pathogenic significance, showing an interactive spread to avoid visual clutter.

The charts emphasize genomic location on the x-axis, using displacement and color to convey stratified information efficiently.
