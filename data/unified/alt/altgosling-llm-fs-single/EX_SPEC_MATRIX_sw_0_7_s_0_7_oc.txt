A linear Hi-C matrix visualization overlays multiple tracks to display genomic interactions. The x- and y-axes represent genomic intervals between positions 800,000,000 and 1,800,000,000. Color intensity encodes expression values on two matrix tracks. Red vertical lines and blue horizontal lines indicate specific genomic positions. Additional annotations include varied point sizes, with steel blue color, representing quantitative data. The display utilizes a light gray background and dashed styling, with axes for top and left orientation, within hg38 genome assembly. The title "Hi-C Matrix" and subtitle "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations" are prominently displayed.
