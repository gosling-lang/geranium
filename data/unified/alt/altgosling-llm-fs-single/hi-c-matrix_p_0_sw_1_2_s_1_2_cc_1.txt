A linear Hi-C matrix visualization displays genomic data across chromosomes 5 to 10 using overlaid tracks. The primary matrix shows genomic interactions with intensity-encoded color using a 'hot' color range. Annotations include sky blue vertical, and green horizontal lines indicate specific genomic positions, while nominally stroked multi-chromosomal matrices display category-differentiated bar edges. Purple points represent data with size-scaled genomic interactions in defined intervals, featuring a light opacity and white stroke. The visualization's title is "Hi-C Matrix," and the subtitle reads "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations."
