A circular layout displaying an area chart visualizes genomic data using a multivec file. The visualization shows a section of chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. Four samples are represented in distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. Each sample's genomic position is displayed on the x-axis in a circular arrangement, while the y-axis shows the peak values as areas. The chart is stratified by rows for each sample, providing a clear comparative view across different genomic data sets. The chart includes tooltips for genomic positions and peak values, enhancing interactivity.
