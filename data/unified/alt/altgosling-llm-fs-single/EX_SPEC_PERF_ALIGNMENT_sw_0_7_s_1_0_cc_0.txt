The visualization comprises two layered tracks showcasing a protein alignment visualization titled "Smoother Zoom." The focus is on genomic positions between intervals 350 and 396, presented in a linear orientation. Both tracks follow an overlay alignment using CSV data from a FASTA file.

The top track, "New Approach: Stretching Tiles," emphasizes an experimental method by stretching graphics instead of redrawing, with colored rectangles representing different genomic bases along the x-axis. Text annotations overlay the rectangles in black, with visibility triggered at a zoom threshold below 10.

The lower track, "Original Approach," follows a traditional method, retaining similar data representation with colored rectangles and text annotations based on genomic bases. The x-axis showcases genomic positions with stratification by name across rows.

Overall, the visualization contrasts two approaches for viewing genomic data efficiently, offering insight into dynamic visual encoding while maintaining consistent styling such as color distinctions and row stratification.
