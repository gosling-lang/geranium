A visualization with a circular and a linear view is arranged vertically. The circular view provides an ideogram of the entire genome, specifically hg19, and is interactive, allowing updates to the linear view through a blue brush. This view has five tracks including an ideogram, a gene track called 'Putative Driver,' with black text annotations, and two tracks for genomic ranges titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' with blue and orange rectangles, respectively. Additionally, connections representing structural variations such as 'Translocation' and 'Duplication' are shown in various colors, driven by the 'svclass' data field.

The linear view displays chromosome 1 and includes additional data layers: a gene annotation track depicting genes and exons, a scatter plot detailing point mutations encoded with a VCF file, and categorized by 'SUBTYPE', and a two-row range annotation track distinguishing 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' events with different colors. The final track, titled 'Copy Number Variants', represents data fields like 'total_cn' using lightgrey rectangles for quantitative values.
