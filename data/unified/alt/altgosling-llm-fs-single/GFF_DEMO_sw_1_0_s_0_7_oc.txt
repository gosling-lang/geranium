A linear visualization representing the E. coli genome is displayed between the genomic positions 222,000 and 240,000 on chromosome U00096.3. The chart is organized by gene strand, with rows for the "+" and "-" strands. Genes are depicted with arrows indicating strand direction, color-coded by gene type: protein coding (orange), tRNA (blue), rRNA (green), ncRNA (red), pseudogene (purple), and unknown (black). Annotated gene names are positioned above the genome. The visualization includes both triangle and line markers, indicating gene positions and orientations, with smoothed paths enhancing clarity. The title is "GFF3 file" and the subtitle is "E. coli genome, colored by gene type."
