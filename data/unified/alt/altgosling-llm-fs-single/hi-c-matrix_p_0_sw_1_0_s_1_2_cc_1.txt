The visualization titled "Hi-C Matrix" displays genomic interactions within the specified interval of 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 on the assembly hg38. It uses an overlaid linear layout involving multiple tracks to reveal patterns within Hi-C data. The main matrix shows chromosomal interactions with color intensity representing interaction values. Additional information is provided through vertical lines in sky blue and horizontal lines in purple, denoting specific genomic positions. Bars with strokes differentiate categorical values, and a series of points in pink further highlight quantitative data, with point size indicating expression levels. The visualization includes a color legend for clarity and is designed with a dashed grid background.
