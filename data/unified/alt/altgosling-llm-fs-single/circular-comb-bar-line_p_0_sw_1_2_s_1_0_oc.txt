The visualization is a circular representation featuring two distinct tracks based on multivec data for chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500.

### First Track:
- **Type**: Circular Bar Chart
- **Data**: Multivec from samples
- **X-axis**: Genomic positions
- **Y-axis**: Peak values
- **Bars**: Represent 'peak' for different samples (sample 1 to sample 4) displayed in circular layout.
- **Categories**: Samples categorized by distinct colors, visible in the legend.
- **Tooltip**: Provides genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample category.

### Second Track:
- **Type**: Circular Line and Scatter Plot
- **Data**: Same multivec dataset, overlaying line and point marks.
- **X-axis**: Genomic positions
- **Y-axis**: Peak values, lines connect points of continuous data.
- **Points**: Size varies based on peak values.
- **Categories**: Lines and points differentiated by sample with distinct colors.
- **Tooltip**: Displays genomic position, peak value, and sample category.

### Layout:
- **Format**: Circular layout with nested views, providing a compact overview of data.
- **Design**: Stratified by rows for sample categories, with legends indicating color codes for each sample.
