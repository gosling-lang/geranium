**Description**: 

This genome visualization consists of circular and linear views integrated for a comprehensive analysis of structural variants and other genomic features. The circular ideogram displays the whole genome, highlighting specific chromosome anomalies. Tracks include:

1. **Ideogram Track**: Shows chromosome bands with a brush interaction linking to the linear view.
2. **Annotation Track**: Titled "Putative Driver," displays gene annotations as text, stratified by rows, where each row is color-coded based on categories.
3. **Range Tracks**: 
   - "Gain" shows genomic intervals in sky blue.
   - "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" displays in dark orange.

4. **Connections Track**: Visualizes structural variants, colored and stroked by categories (e.g., Gain, LOH, Translocation, etc.).

The linear view, corresponding to chromosome 1, further details:

- **Ideogram with Triangular Marks**: Shows centromeric regions with arrows indicating directionality.
- **Gene Track**: Annotates gene positions and structures with gray markers, providing strand information.
- **Scatterplot**: "Point Mutation" track highlights mutation types with dots colored by subtype.
- **Range Tracks**: Include "Copy Number Variants," showing expression levels with gray rectangles, and separate tracks for specific "Insertion" and "Deletion" events using two distinct colors.

Overall, this visualization effectively integrates multiscale genomic data, employing interactive elements to
