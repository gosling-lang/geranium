A circular and linear genomic visualization showing chromosome 1 data with a linked brush interaction. The circular view includes tracks for ideograms, putative drivers, gain, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH), displayed with color-coded rectangles. The central circular track visualizes structural variations with connections colored by categories like 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and others. The linear view aligns these to chromosome 1, including tracks for point mutations, insertions, deletions, and copy number variants. Each track uses distinct color schemes to represent different data fields and annotations.
