**Description:**

A circular bar chart visualizes genomic data, focusing on chromosome 12, ranging from positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The visualization is arranged in a circular layout, featuring multiple concentric tracks representing different samples. Each track is a bar chart, where the height indicates quantitative values from the "peak" field of the data. The tracks are stratified by sample categories, which are encoded using distinct colors. The data shown is from a multivec file, applying a filter to exclude a specified category of "sample -." The inner and outer radii of the visualization define its size and spacing, providing a comprehensive view of genomic intervals. The bars' color differentiation highlights various sample categories, enabling easy comparison across genomic regions. This visualization, rendered from assembly hg38, offers an intricate overview of expression values along specified genome intervals.
