The visualization is a heatmap in a linear layout, encoded with genomic positions from the hg38 assembly on both axes. The intensity of colors represents quantitative expression values, with a color scheme ranging from yellow to dark brown indicating varying intensities. The visualization is static, with chromosomes labeled on the axes, and no interactive elements. The heatmap's design provides an overview of genomic interactions within specific intervals.
