A heat map in a linear layout visualizes a matrix of genomic data from a specified interval between 800,000,000 and 1,800,000,000 on the genome assembly hg38. The x-axis represents genomic coordinates, while the y-axis represents genomic positions, showing intervals. The color intensity within each cell encodes quantitative expression values, with a "hot" color scheme indicating varying levels of expression. The visualization's dimensions are set to 630x630 pixels, with the matrix data sourced from a specified URL.
