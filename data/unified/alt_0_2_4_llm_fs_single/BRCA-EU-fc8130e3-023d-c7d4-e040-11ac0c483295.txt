The visualization comprises a circular and a linear arrangement, linked via an interactive brush. The circular view displays the entire genome (hg19) with five tracks: an ideogram, a text track, two rectangular annotation tracks labeled "Gain" (blue) and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" (orange), and a connection track visualizing genomic links in various colors based on structural variation types like "Translocation" and "Duplication." The linear view highlights chromosome 1 with additional tracks, including genomic annotations, a scatterplot showing point mutations, and bar charts for "Copy Number Variants." The scatterplot visualizes mutation distances with colored points reflecting different nucleotide substitutions. Rectangular tracks stratify data by mutation types, such as "Insertion" and "Deletion," using distinct colors.
