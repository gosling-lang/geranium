The visualization is a circular layout composed of two main tracks. The left track is an area chart displaying genomic data from a multivec file across samples 1 to 4 of chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. Each row represents a different sample, with color-coded areas: blue, orange, green, and red. The y-axis quantifies the peaks in expression levels. The right track is a connection chart using data from a CSV file. It illustrates genomic interactions, with intervals on the x-axis and connections shown in various colors to represent different data categories. The layout effectively visualizes genomic data, facilitating comparisons across samples and interactions within chromosome 1.
