The visualization depicts a circular scatter plot with the genomic intervals of chromosome 12 ranging from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000 on the x-axis. It encodes expression data as points stratified by rows for various samples, using colors to differentiate categories. The plot includes 16 rows representing different samples, visualizing quantitative peaks. The different opacity levels provide clarity for overlapping data points. This visualization offers a detailed view of genomic data, facilitating easy comparison across multiple samples and data ranges.
