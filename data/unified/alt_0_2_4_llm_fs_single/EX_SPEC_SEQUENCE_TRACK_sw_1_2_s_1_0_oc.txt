A linear visualization displaying a sequence multivec file maps the interval from 3,000,000 to 3,000,010 on chromosome 1. Bars and text represent genomic positions. Each nucleotide ('A', 'T', 'G', 'C') is colored differently, with blue, pink, green, and orange representing 'G', 'A', 'C', and 'T', respectively. Text display is bold and white, and bar heights are proportional to the counts at each position. A legend identifies nucleotide categories. The visualization is interactive, with the size reflecting the zoom level.
