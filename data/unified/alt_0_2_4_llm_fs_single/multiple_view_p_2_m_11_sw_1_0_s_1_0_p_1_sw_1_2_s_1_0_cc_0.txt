The visualization features a vertical arrangement with linked interactive components across chromosome 1 (positions 160,000,000 to 200,000,000). The top section displays a multivec scatter plot with rows representing categories 'sample 1' through 'sample 4', each assigned a distinct color: blue, orange, green, and red. Below, a horizontal section includes an area plot layered with a brush, facilitating interaction and linking these views. Adjacent, a circular layout presents a line chart, also linked by a brush. The views offer detailed exploration by dynamically updating based on selected genomic ranges. The title is "Visual Linking" with the subtitle providing interaction guidance.
