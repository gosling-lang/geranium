A complex genomic visualization consists of a circular ideogram and a linear view with interactive elements. The circular view includes tracks such as an ideogram, a point annotation labeled 'Putative Driver,' range annotation tracks for 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' and a track with colored connections depicting structural variations like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.' Each track uses distinct colors and shapes to represent categorical data. The visualization highlights chromosome data from HG19, with a blue brush linking the circular and linear views for interactive zooming. The linear view details chromosome 1 with tracks for gene annotation, point mutations, and copy number variations. Points indicate distance to previous mutations, enriched with a legend representing mutation subtypes like 'C>A' and 'T>G.' Rectangles in the 'Copy Number Variants' track visualize quantitative data across genomic ranges. This integrated layout allows exploration of genomic variations, offering a comprehensive view of chromosome-level alterations and annotations.
