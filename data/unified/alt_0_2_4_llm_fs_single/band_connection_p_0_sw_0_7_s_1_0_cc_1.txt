Linear alignment display of segmental duplication across chromosome 1, spanning positions 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. The visualization includes three key elements: rectangles and connections. The rectangles are colored in pink on the outer tracks and purple on the inner tracks, denoting genomic intervals. Between these intervals, pale green and purple connections depict links between segment start and end positions defined in pairs, visualizing genomic relationships within the segmental duplication data from a CSV file. The layout presents an interactive genomic comparison with highlighted start and end positions, useful for identifying duplication patterns in this chromosomal region.
