A linear visualization overlays multiple tracks, illustrating a multivec file against the hg38 genome assembly. The main bar chart presents genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression peaks on the y-axis, colored in purple. Overlaid on this are horizontal and vertical dashed lines, mapping specific positions with variable stroke widths, in two colors: pink for the rules with variable stroke width, and purple for consistent stroke width. Positioned between the chromosomes chr1 to chr22, this visualization is titled "Rule Mark" and subtitled "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines."
