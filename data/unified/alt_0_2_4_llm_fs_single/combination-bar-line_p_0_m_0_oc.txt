A linear visualization consists of two vertically arranged tracks showcasing genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions from 1 to 3,000,500. The top track displays a multivec file as a stacked bar chart where the x-axis represents genomic positions, and the y-axis represents expression levels. The chart is categorized by four samples, each distinguished by different colors. It includes a grid for quantitative values and a legend indicating the sample categories. The bottom track integrates a scatter plot with a line chart in an overlay to depict the same genomic interval. Points and lines are stratified by sample, with line thickness representing expression peak sizes. The legend and colors are consistent across tracks, facilitating comparative analysis. Tooltips provide detailed information on genomic positions, values, and samples.
