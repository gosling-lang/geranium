A circular area chart visualizes multivec data across chromosome 12, spanning from positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. This chart features sixteen categories represented as stratified rows, each depicted by distinct colors. The y-axis measures the expression level, conveyed through the use of area fills with varying levels of opacity. The inner track exhibits the full range of data, while subsequent outer tracks display segmented data ranges with decreasing opacity: 0 to 0.0025, 0.0025 to 0.005, 0.005 to 0.0075, and 0.0075 to 0.01. This visualization is based on the reference by Javed et al. on the graphical perception of multiple time series, showcasing genomic data in a visually compelling circular format.
