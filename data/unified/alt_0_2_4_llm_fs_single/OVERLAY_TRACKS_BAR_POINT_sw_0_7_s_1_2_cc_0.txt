The visualization is a genomic plot in a linear layout, showcasing data from chromosome 3. It features an overlay of bars and points, representing the significance of variants from a BEDDB data file. The bars use varying color strokes, such as orange for “Pathogenic” and green for “Benign,” signifying different categories of significance. Points are displayed in matching colors, enhancing visual distinction between categories. The plot is titled "Example: Overlay Tracks" and includes a legend for clarity. The y-axis is domain-based on significance categories, with a baseline set at “Uncertain significance.”
