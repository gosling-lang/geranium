The visualization is a linear layout with five coordinated tracks, each illustrating genomic data related to chromosome 1 of the hg38 assembly. The first track is an ideogram with categories indicated by colors and geometric shapes, such as rectangles, and left and right triangles, depicting different banding patterns. The second track is a genomic position annotation with directional triangles showing gene orientations distinguished by strand, with colors indicating the "+" (blue-gray) and "-" (beige) strands. The third and fourth tracks display chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs) as rectangles, where red indicates regions with zero minor copy numbers in the tumor, and green shows higher total copy numbers. The final track is a connection track visualizing genomic rearrangements with curved lines of various colors, corresponding to different structural variant classes like tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions. The visualization includes overlays and transformations to enhance interactive exploration and interpretation.
