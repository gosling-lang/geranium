The visualization consists of a circular view and a linear view arranged vertically. The circular view represents the entire genome of the hg19 assembly and includes an ideogram, a putative driver track with gene annotations, and range annotation tracks for 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH).' The lines within the circle connect genomic positions and are colored based on structural variations such as 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.' An interactive brush on the circular ideogram links to the linear view below, which zooms into chromosome 1. 

The linear view includes tracks for genomic annotations, point mutations, insertions, deletions, and copy number variants. The scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' displays data points along the chromosome, color-coded by mutation subtype ('C>A', 'C>G', etc.). Two additional tracks show insertions and deletions with distinct colors and a chart for copy number variants visualized by gray bars. The positions of structural variants are indicated by colored connections, providing insights into genomic rearrangements.
