**Description:**

A circular ideogram chart shows chromosome bands across the entire genome of hg38. The genome is depicted with intervals along the x-axis. Different colors represent various cytogenetic bands, with categories like "gneg," "gpos25," and others distinguished by shades such as blue and orange.

Inside the ideogram, there are two circular tracks represented by rectangles. The first track uses green rectangles to highlight regions based on the "minor_cn_tumor" field where the value is "0." The second track uses sky blue rectangles to depict regions with "total_cn_tumor" values between 4.5 and 900.

At the center, a circular chart with connections displays genomic rearrangements. The connections link different genomic positions, with colors and strokes indicating different types of structural variations like "tandem-duplication," "translocation," and "inversion." The line colors and strokes vary, adding more detail to the visualization of genomic structures.
