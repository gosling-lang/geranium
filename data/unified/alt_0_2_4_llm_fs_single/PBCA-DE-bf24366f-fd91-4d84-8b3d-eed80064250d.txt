A visualization featuring a circular ideogram and a linear track. The circular view, covering the entire hg19 genome assembly, includes an interactive brush for linking to the linear view. Tracks in the circular view display an ideogram, text annotations titled "Putative Driver," and range annotations for "Gain" in sky blue and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in dark orange. Various types of structural variations, such as Translocations and Inversions, are represented through connections. The linear view highlights chromosome 1, showing a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" visualizing VCF file data, where each point's position reflects the distance to the previous mutation, categorized by mutation subtype. Rectangular tracks display annotations for insertions, deletions, and copy number variants using csv and VCF files, with specific colors for different mutation types.
