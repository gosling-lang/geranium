A linear area chart displays genomic data from a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 1, spanning from positions 1 to 3,000,500, represented in a vertical arrangement. It consists of four rows corresponding to 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' Each sample is visualized with an area mark, colored in blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The x-axis displays genomic positions, and the y-axis corresponds to quantitative 'peak' values. The chart features a legend indicating the sample categories, and a tooltip provides detailed genomic start/end positions and peak values for each area.
