A multi-track Hi-C matrix visualization overlays multiple data layers, integrating genomic data from chromosomal intervals between 800,000,000 and 1,800,000,000 on the hg38 assembly. A genomic heat map, visualized as a grey color gradient matrix, occupies the main area. Vertical and horizontal red and blue lines highlight key genomic positions, indicating specified genomic positions on chromosomes 2, 5, and 10. Superimposed are quantitative annotations marked by color-coded bars and steel blue points, each reflecting genomic positions with size and opacity representing specific quantitative values. The visualization is titled "Hi-C Matrix" with a subtitle "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations," embracing a dynamic approach to genomic interaction and density mapping.
