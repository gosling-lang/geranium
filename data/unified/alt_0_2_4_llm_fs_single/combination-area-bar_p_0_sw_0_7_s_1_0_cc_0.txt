The visualization comprises two vertically arranged tracks showing genomic data for chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is an area chart displaying quantitative peak values for four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. It uses colored areas, with each sample represented by a distinct color. The bottom track is a bar chart representing the minimum and maximum peak values for the same samples, with bars colored according to the samples. Both tracks are stratified by rows for the categories and are positioned on the x-axis according to their genomic coordinates. The visualization highlights data trends and variations across samples, with interactivity supported through tooltips and the assignment of specific colors to each sample for easy differentiation.
