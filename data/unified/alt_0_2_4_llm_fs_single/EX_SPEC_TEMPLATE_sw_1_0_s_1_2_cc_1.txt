A linear visualization employs Gosling.js track templates to facilitate complex visualizations. The layout includes a gene annotation track, a sequence bar chart, and an ideogram. The gene annotation track displays genomic ranges with genes as text, color-coded by strand, spanning chromosome 3 positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. The sequence bar chart showcases nucleotide counts (A, T, G, C) on chromosome 1, positions 77,925,299 to 77,925,320, with bar lengths indicating count levels. Lastly, the ideogram visualizes the complete chromosome 1, featuring cytobands and annotations, helping contextualize the alignment of the other tracks. The visualization is enhanced by smoothed paths and a bright color palette, making genome exploration intuitive.
