The visualization is a combined matrix view composed of two overlaid matrix tracks displayed on the same genomic axes, showing intervals on both the x- and y-axes for chromosome 10. The first matrix, colored in grey, occupies the lower-left quadrant, while the second matrix, in warm colors ranging to orange, fills the upper-right quadrant. Both matrices use color intensity to represent quantitative expression values. The layout is linear, oriented horizontally, with responsive resizing enabled. The visualization emphasizes detailed genomic data from a matrix type file, highlighting variance across chromosome 10 with a quantitative legend displayed.
