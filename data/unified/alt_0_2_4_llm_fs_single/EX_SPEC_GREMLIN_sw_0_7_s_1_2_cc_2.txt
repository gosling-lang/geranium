This visualization titled "Gremlin (O'Brien et al. 2010)" features a series of charts related to Chromosome 5. The top panel is a linear ideogram that maps the genome of Chromosome 5, color-coded into various stain categories such as gneg and gpos regions, with pink highlighting key areas. Below, two layered tracks display genomic connections between different regions of the chromosome. The connections are color-coded by chromosomes hs5, hs4, and hs6, represented in shades of blue, orange, and green respectively.

The visualization also includes a magnified view titled "Region of Interest," detailing genomic interactions on Chromosome 5 between intervals 68,000,000 and 71,000,000, with segment color-coded connections indicating hs5, hs4, and hs6 interactions. The "Rearrangement View" at the bottom offers a close-up on a specific segment, highlighting rearrangements primarily in a blue arc. Each chart is intricately linked, allowing navigation through a brush linking interactions across the views. The visualization spans horizontally and is styled with an elliptical link style and light gray outlines for clarity.
