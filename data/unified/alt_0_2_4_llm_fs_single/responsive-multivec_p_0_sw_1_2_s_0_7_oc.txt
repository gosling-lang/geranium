A stacked bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart is stratified by rows for 14 samples, each represented by a different color. Categories are shown with varying opacity, adjusted based on track height visibility thresholds. The data field 'peak' encodes the height of the bars, reflecting quantitative expression levels. The reference denotes Javed et al.'s work on graphical perception of multiple time series.
