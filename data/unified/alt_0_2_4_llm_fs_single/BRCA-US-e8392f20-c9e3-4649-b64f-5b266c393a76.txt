The visualization consists of a circular and linear genomic data representation. The circular view displays the entire genome (assembly hg19) with a blue interactive brush for highlighting sections. It includes an ideogram, annotated genomic ranges, and line connections indicating structural variations with categories such as 'Gain,' 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion' distinguished by color.

The linear view, linked via the brush, focuses on chromosome 1 and provides a detailed inspection with tracks showing gene annotations, point mutations, indels, and copy number variations. 'Point Mutation' is a scatter plot with points colored by mutation type. The view includes two additional tracks for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' visualized in a color-coded bar format, and a 'Copy Number Variants' track displaying quantitative data through gray rectangles.
