A visualization in a vertical arrangement consists of a circular view and two horizontal bar chart views, linked via interactive brushes. The circular view displays genomic data with multivec format for samples 1 to 4, represented by colored bars for each sample—blue, orange, green, and red—arranged in rows. Genomic intervals are shown along the circular axis, and rows are stratified by sample categories. An overlay of connections displays rearrangements, with purple connections indicating deletion, inversion, translocation, and tandem-duplication across selected chromosomes. 

The horizontal views depict zoomed sections of chromosomes 5 and 16 corresponding to the interactive brushes from the circular view. Each bar chart is divided by row, showing similar color-coded categories. The bars represent peak values along the y-axis with genomic intervals on the x-axis. The background colors, blue and red, provide distinct visual separation between the zoomed chromosome views.
