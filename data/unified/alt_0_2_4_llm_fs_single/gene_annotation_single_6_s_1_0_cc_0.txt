The visualization presents a linear genomic range annotation track titled 'Cyverse-QUBES' for chromosome 3, spanning from 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. This horizontal layout consists of multiple visual encodings to represent gene features stratified by the strand orientation into '+' and '-'.

Text elements in green indicate gene names positioned along their genomic start and end points. Green right-facing triangles denote genes on the '+' strand, while purple left-facing triangles represent genes on the '-' strand. The genomic regions are further detailed with pink rectangles for genes and sky-blue rectangles with a purple stroke for exons. Purple lines depict gene spans, providing additional structural context.

This visualization effectively combines color and shape to convey genomic annotations, offering a comprehensive view of gene organization within the specified region.
