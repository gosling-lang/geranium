The visualization titled "Mark Displacement" uses a linear layout to depict genomic data across three chromosomes (chr3, chr2, and chr17), with each track strategically repositioned to address visual overlaps. The first track displays up to 15 rows of transcript data from chr3, using right and left triangles to show gene orientation and colored lines to indicate strandsâ€”blue for positive and orange for negative. The second track focuses on chr2, presenting "Likely Benign" clinical annotations with green points, linked by green connections. Text annotations depict specific nominal categories, while the track also includes thematic A/T/G/C labeling. The final track covers chr17, showing points color-coded by variant pathogenicity, including magenta for pathogenic variants. Displacement techniques like piling and spreading are employed to effectively separate overlapping data points.
