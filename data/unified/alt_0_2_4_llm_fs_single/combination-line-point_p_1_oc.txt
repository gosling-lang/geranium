Two stacked tracks are displayed in a linear vertical arrangement, visualizing multivec data for chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The top track is a scatter plot showing point annotations to represent genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis. The data is stratified into rows by categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4,' each category represented by a distinct color with a legend provided. The points vary in size according to the peak values, and the opacity is set to 0.5.

The bottom track overlays a line chart and scatter plot, displaying genomic positions on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis. Each category is shown in a distinct color in both lines and points, with size variation representing peak values. Both tracks offer tooltips for genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample information.

The visualization uses data from a multivec file with categories 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4' and maintains a uniform width of 600 with varying heights. The arrangement is augmented by an 0.8 center radius specification.
