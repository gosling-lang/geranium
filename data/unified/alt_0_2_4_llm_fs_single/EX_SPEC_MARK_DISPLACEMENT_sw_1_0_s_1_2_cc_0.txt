The visualization showcases a complex genomic data layout focusing on mark displacement techniques to handle visual overlaps, using hg38 and ClinVar datasets. It presents a linear arrangement with multiple views and tracks.

The first view illustrates the hg38 transcripts across chromosome 3, employing a pile method for displacement, displaying up to 15 rows. Arrows indicate genomic directions based on strand orientation, and text labels provide gene names. Exons are depicted as rectangles, while rules and triangles further mark gene segments.

The second view, titled “Likely Benign,” represents the ClinVar data on chromosome 2, highlighting likely benign variants. An overlay of points, colored text for nucleotide bases, and connection links visualizes genetic significance, using a spread method for better visual clarity.

The third view features genomic annotations for chromosome 17, with points indicating pathogenicity. Variants are color-coded by significance, and displacement is applied to ensure readability.

This visualization effectively handles complex genomic data by employing strategic layout and displacement methods, enhancing interpretability of detailed genomic information across specified chromosomal regions.
