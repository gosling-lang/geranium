The visualization consists of a circular and linear view arranged vertically. The circular view shows the entire genome assembly "hg38" with an ideogram track, a text annotation track, two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and a line-connection track displaying connections between genomic positions. Different colors represent categories like "Gain," "LOH," "Translocation," "Duplication," "Deletion," and "Inversion." The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, featuring an ideogram, gene annotations, a scatter plot of "Point Mutations," and tracks displaying "Insertions," "Deletions," and "Copy Number Variants." The views are linked by an interactive brush on the circular ideogram, facilitating region exploration. Data sources include a mix of CSV, JSON, and VCF files, highlighting various genomic features through visualization techniques such as bars, points, and connections.
