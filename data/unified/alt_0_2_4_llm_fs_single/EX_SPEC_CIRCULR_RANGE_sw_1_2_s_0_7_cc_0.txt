A circular bar chart visualizes a vector file, showing genomic positions across the entire genome (hg38 assembly). The positions are represented on the x-axis in a circular layout, while the y-axis encodes quantitative values named 'peak.' The bars are colored pink. The chart is static, with a center radius creating a stacked alignment effect, emphasizing the circular representation's radial symmetry. The width is 588 units.
