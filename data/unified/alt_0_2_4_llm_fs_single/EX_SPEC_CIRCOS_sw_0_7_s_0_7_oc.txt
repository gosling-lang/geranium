The visualization is a circular plot created using the Circos tool. It features three distinct tracks: a bar chart, an ideogram, and a within-link connection chart. The bar chart displays genomic data, with positions along the x-axis and peak values represented by the height of bars, colored in light yellow (#EEEDA1). The ideogram shows chromosomes as intervals, color-coded based on cytogenetic bands, using shades of gray and other colors. The connection chart illustrates relationships between genomic segments with colored links, highlighting structural variations across different chromosomes. The title of the visualization is "Circos."
