The visualization consists of a circular view and a linear view arranged vertically. The circular view presents a whole-genome ideogram with a chromosome-specific zoom enabled by a blue interactive brush. The tracks within the circular view include a labeled ideogram, a text track titled "Putative Driver," and two range annotation tracks: "Gain" with sky blue rectangles and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" with dark orange rectangles. A within-link track shows connections denoted by lines colored according to the structural variation types: "Gain," "LOH," "Translocation," "Duplication," "Deletion," "Inversion (TtT)," and "Inversion (HtH)."

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, detailing tracks such as an ideogram with p/q arm indicators, a gene annotation track, and a "Putative Driver" text track. A "Point Mutation" scatter plot visualizes variant data with points colored by mutation subtypes. Additionally, the view includes two range annotation tracks: "Insertion" and "Deletion" with color-coded rectangles, and a "Copy Number Variants" track showing variations as gray bars.

The visualization efficiently integrates genomic annotations, creating a comprehensive visual summary of genomic variations and their spatial relationships.
