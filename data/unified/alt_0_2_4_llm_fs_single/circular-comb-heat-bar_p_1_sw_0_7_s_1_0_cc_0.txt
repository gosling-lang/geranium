A circular visualization showcases genomic data across chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The left chart is a circular bar chart divided into four rows representing samples, each colored differently (blue, orange, green, red). Bars in each row indicate the quantitative 'peak' values for each sample. The right chart is a circular heat map displaying the same genomic regions with color intensity representing 'peak' values, following a gradient from light to dark in a 'hot' color scheme. Both charts include tooltips for interactive data exploration.
