A circular layout visualizes genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The visualization comprises two circular tracks arranged vertically. The first track on the left displays a circular bar chart where the x-axis represents genomic positions, and the y-axis shows peak values, stratified by samples. Each sample is shown in a distinct color: blue, orange, green, and red. The second track on the right is a circular heatmap, with color intensity encoding peak values. Both tracks are stratified by sample categories, allowing comparison across multiple samples. The layout uses a fixed center radius and is set to static, emphasizing comparative analysis across predefined genomic intervals.
