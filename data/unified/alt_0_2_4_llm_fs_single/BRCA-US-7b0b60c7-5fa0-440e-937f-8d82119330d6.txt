A genomic visualization displaying a comprehensive circular and linear representation of chromosome information using hg19 assembly. The circular layout features an ideogram, annotated tracks, and links showing structural variations with categories like 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)', presented using distinct colors. The linear view zooms into chromosome 1, adding detail with ideograms, point mutation markers, and annotations for variations like copy number and structural variants. Interactive elements allow interlinking between views for deeper exploration.
