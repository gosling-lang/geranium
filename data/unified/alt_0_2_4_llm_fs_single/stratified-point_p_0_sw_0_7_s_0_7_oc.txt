The visualization depicts a linear scatter plot, presenting a multivec file across chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. Each row corresponds to a different sample ('sample 1' to 'sample 4') and is distinguished by color: yellow, green, blue, and pink, respectively. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis and the size of each point illustrate expression values (peak). Points are organized to show the variation in expression across samples, with an opacity level of 50%, allowing overlapping data points to be discernible. The data includes genomic coordinates and peak values, with a legend indicating sample categories.
