The visualization consists of multiple views showing genomic data relating to chromosome 5. The main view features an ideogram with bands colored to represent staining, labeled with band names for categories such as 'gpos' and 'gneg', and includes a pink highlight for 'acen' bands. Below the ideogram, there are two additional tracks: a multipart track with colored links denoting segment duplications across different chromosomes, and a specific within-link view for duplicate segments within chromosome 5, represented in green arcs.

Further below, two linked subviews provide a detailed examination. The "Region of Interest" view illustrates interconnected genomic locations within a defined interval on chromosome 5, again utilizing colored arcs to indicate interchromosomal connections for chromosomes 5, 4, and 6. This is supplemented by a "Rearrangement View" that focuses on a smaller genomic window, highlighting local structural variations within chromosome 5 using blue arcs.

Overall, these views offer insights into chromosomal bands, genomic duplicates, and localized genomic arrangements, all within the context of the genomic structure of chromosome 5, as detailed by O'Brien et al. (2010). The different components are effectively linked by interactive brushes for detailed exploration.
