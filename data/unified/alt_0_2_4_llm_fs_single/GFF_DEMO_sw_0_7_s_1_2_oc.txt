The visualization is a linear genomic chart representing a GFF3 file of the E. coli genome, specifically showcasing the region from 222,000 to 240,000 on chromosome U00096.3. It is titled "GFF3 file" with the subtitle "E. coli genome, colored by gene type." The chart is color-coded based on gene biotype, displaying different categories such as protein-coding (orange), tRNA (blue), rRNA (green), ncRNA (red), pseudogene (purple), and unknown (black). The tracks include annotations for genes using text, vertical lines, and triangular markers indicating gene orientation: triangleRight for the "+" strand and triangleLeft for the "-" strand. Styles include smooth paths, with text annotations slightly above the lines.
