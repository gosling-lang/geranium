A visualization titled "Hi-C Matrix" with the subtitle "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations" is presented. This overlay comprises multiple tracks combining matrix and annotation elements to explore genomic data across chromosomes 5 to 10. The matrix layout, marked with bars, encodes genomic interactions, showcasing intensity through a 'hot' color range, providing insights into expression values. The visual is enriched with green vertical and sky-blue horizontal rule annotations along genomic axes, forming a grid that emphasizes significant genomic positions. Additional overlaid elements include bars and points representing quantitative data fields, further differentiated by nominal category strokes and values. The layout brings forth a comprehensive genomic exploration within specified intervals, maintaining a harmonious integration of quantitative and categorical data representations.
