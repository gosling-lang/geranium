The visualization titled "Rule Mark" uses overlay alignment to display multiple tracks in a linear layout, annotated with horizontal and vertical lines. The primary track is a bar chart illustrating genomic intervals on the x-axis and quantitative expression values on the y-axis using pink bars. Two additional tracks display lines: the first has horizontal and vertical lines with varying stroke widths in pink, depicting genomic positions, and the second shows vertical lines in sky blue. The visualization employs a dashed styling for annotations, enhancing the clarity of genomic variations within the bar chart.
