The visualization titled "Visual Linking" features a vertically arranged interface that includes a scatter plot and two linked views: a circular chart and an area chart. The top section contains a scatter plot illustrating genomic data from chromosome 1 between 160,000,000 and 200,000,000. Different categories are represented by colors assigned to the points, stratified by rows: sample 1 (blue), sample 2 (orange), sample 3 (green), and sample 4 (red).

The bottom section comprises two horizontally arranged views. The left is a circular line chart representing the entire chromosome 1, with lines color-coded by category. A movable brush is integrated into this chart, allowing users to interactively select genomic intervals. On the right, a linear area chart provides a detailed view that updates based on the brush's position in the circular chart. This chart shows quantitative peaks represented as colored areas, stratified by categories, matching the circular chart's color scheme. 

The subtitle "Change the position and range of brushes to update the detail view on the bottom" implies user interaction is leveraged to navigate and explore genomic data. The visual linking between the charts allows for seamless exploration of both high-level summaries and detailed views of genomic regions.
