A linear visualization of genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. The layout consists of a vertical arrangement featuring two main tracks. The top track is a multi-row bar chart, displaying expression peaks for four samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4'). Each row corresponds to a sample and is encoded in distinct colors for differentiation. The x-axis represents genomic positions, and the y-axis denotes expression levels. The bottom track is a heatmap, illustrating the same samples across genomic intervals. Color intensity in the heatmap varies to indicate quantitative peak values, providing an additional dimension of analysis. Both tracks incorporate interactive tooltips for detailed genomic, value, and sample information, enhancing data exploration.
