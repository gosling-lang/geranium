A circular layout visualization depicts genomic data from chromosome 1 using a within-link mark. The circular chart, colored in diverse hues, illustrates the connections between genomic intervals. The data spans the genomic positions between 103,900,000 and 104,100,000 on chromosome 1. Colors represent different categories, enhancing the differentiation of data segments. The links are semi-transparent with a black outline, giving a layered appearance. This visualization uses a CSV file for data input, highlighting structural relationships within the specified genomic range.
