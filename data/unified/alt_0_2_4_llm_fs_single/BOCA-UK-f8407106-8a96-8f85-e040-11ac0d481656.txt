The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view arranged vertically. The circular view provides an overview of the entire genome, featuring multiple tracks such as an ideogram, point annotation, range annotations titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' and a line-connection track. The 'Putative Driver' track annotates genomic positions with text. The range tracks depict genomic intervals in specific colors: blue for 'Gain' and red for 'LOH.' Connections are shown between genomic positions and categorized by structural variations such as 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.' The linear view zooms into chromosome 1, illustrating detailed tracks including a gene annotation track, a scatterplot of 'Point Mutation,' and 'Copy Number Variants' represented by bars. The scatterplot uses colors to differentiate mutation subtypes, while structural variations in the linear view are also color-coded. Interactive elements link the circular and linear views, allowing detailed exploration of chromosome 1's genomic data.
