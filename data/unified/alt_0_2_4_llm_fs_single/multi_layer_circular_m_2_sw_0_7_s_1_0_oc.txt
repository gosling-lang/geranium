A circular area chart visualizing a multivec file shows chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The layout is circular with a specified center radius and involves multiple overlapping tracks. It encodes genomic positions along the x-axis and quantitative expression values along the y-axis, segmented by categories named 'sample 1' through 'sample 16.' Each category is colored uniquely. The data is stratified by rows according to samples, utilizing different opacity levels for distinct quantitative domains. The description from Javed et al. on graphical perception of multiple time series is referenced.
