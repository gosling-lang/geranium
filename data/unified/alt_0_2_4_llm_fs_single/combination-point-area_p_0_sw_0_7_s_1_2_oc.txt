A composite visualization in a linear vertical layout displays data from a multivec file pertaining to chromosome 1 between 1 and 3,000,500. The top chart is a scatter plot showing genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, where point size is proportional to the expression value. Categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4' are distinguished by different colors, enhancing interpretability. The bottom chart is an area plot revealing the same genomic intervals, stratified by rows corresponding to each sample category, with areas filled using the same set of colors. Both charts include tooltips offering additional data details, such as positions and values, enhancing interactivity and detail on demand. The visualization uses hg38 as the genomic assembly.
