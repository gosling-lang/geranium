The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view linked by an interactive brush. The circular view encompasses the entire hg19 genome with tracks including an ideogram, text annotations, range annotations titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' and connections showing structural variations. These variations are categorized by colors such as blue for 'Gain' and orange for 'LOH.' The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and repeats similar tracks with additional ones, including gene annotations, point mutations, and copy number variants (CNV). The point mutation track visualizes a VCF file with positions representing distance to previous mutations, colored by subtype categories. The CNV track displays quantitative data using gray rectangles, and further tracks indicate genomic insertions and deletions.
