A circular layout visualization titled "Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts" illustrates various genomic data visualizations using Gosling's encoding methods for chromosome 1, ranging from 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. The display comprises vertically arranged views, featuring a diverse set of circular charts, each characterized by unique visual encodings.

1. **Circular Scatter Plots**: Two scatter plots use points to display expression values, stratified by categories (sample 1 to sample 4) using distinct colors. Size and opacity of points indicate quantitative variations.

2. **Circular Line and Scatter Plot**: This chart integrates lines and points to show expression levels, with categories indicated by color. Point sizes vary with expression values and are arranged in rows by category.

3. **Circular Bar Charts**: Comprising two bar plots, these charts display expression levels with bar heights along the y-axis and different categories determined by color.

4. **Circular Heat Map**: This chart segments genomic regions into intervals on the x-axis, with color intensity encoding expression values, stratified by sample categories.

5. **Circular Connection Chart**: Displaying genomic connections, this chart uses colored lines to link genomic positions, indicating different categories based on the color of connections.

6. **Circular Area Chart**: The final chart uses colored areas to represent expression across the genome, stratified by sample categories, with each category distinctly colored.

This visualization effectively demonstrates Gosling's capability in rendering complex genomic data in circular
