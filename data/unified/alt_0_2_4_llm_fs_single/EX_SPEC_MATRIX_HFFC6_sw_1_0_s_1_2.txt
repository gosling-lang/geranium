The visualization titled "Matrix Visualization: Comparison of Micro-C and Hi-C for HFFc6 Cells" displays genomic data in a horizontal arrangement, focusing on chromosome 7 from 77,700,000 to 81,000,000 base pairs. It includes:

1. **Vertical Tracks**: 
   - Bar charts for HFFc6_H3K4me3, HFFc6_ATAC, and HFFc6_CTCF data. The bars represent genomic intervals with expression values on the y-axis. Colors include dark green, orange, and navy blue for different datasets.
   - Genomic position annotation tracks with right and left triangles, colored pink and green, representing data stratified by strand categories.

2. **Horizontal Views**: 
   - A matrix visualization showing the HFFc6_Micro-C and HFFc6_Hi-C data. The genomic intervals are displayed on both x- and y-axes with expression values encoded by color intensity in a warm palette.
   - Additional bar charts titled "Epilogos (hg38)," showing different chromatin states with colors indicating various categories like Active TSS, Enhancers, and others.

The plot provides an integrated view of epigenomic and chromatin interaction data to compare Micro-C and Hi-C methods across specified genomic regions.
