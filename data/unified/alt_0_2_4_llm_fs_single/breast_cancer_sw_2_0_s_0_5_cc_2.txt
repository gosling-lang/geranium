**Description:**

A linear visualization displays various genomic data tracks on chromosome 1. The top track is an ideogram with regions color-coded based on cytogenetic bands, indicating categories such as "gneg" and "gpos" with colors like blue, orange, and green. The second track shows genomic positions with blue right-facing and orange left-facing triangles representing gene strands. Each strand is distinguished by its position and orientation. The third track includes green rectangles signifying regions of "minor_cn_tumor" with values of zero. The fourth track consists of purple rectangles depicting genomic positions where "total_cn_tumor" is within a specified range. Finally, the bottom track demonstrates connections within chromosome rearrangements, illustrated as lines linking start and end positions across different regions. These connections are visually encoded by color and stroke based on structural variant classes like "tandem-duplication" and "translocation." The entire visualization leverages a nominal color scheme to highlight various genomic features and categories.
