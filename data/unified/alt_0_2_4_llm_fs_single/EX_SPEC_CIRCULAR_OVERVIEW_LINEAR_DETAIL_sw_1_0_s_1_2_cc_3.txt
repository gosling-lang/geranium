The visualization displays a genomic dataset using a circular and linear layout arrangement. The circular chart at the top features a stacked layout, including two key tracks. The first track is a multi-row bar chart depicting genomic intervals across chromosomes with expression levels shown as bars, color-coded by sample categories (sample 1 to sample 4). Brushing is enabled on both axes, allowing interaction with detailed linear charts. The second track utilizes connections to illustrate genomic rearrangements, such as deletions, inversions, translocations, and tandem duplications, with strokes varying between black and green for different categories.

Below, two horizontally arranged linear bar charts are presented. Both charts are synchronized with the circular chart by brush interactionsâ€”one displaying data from chromosome 5 and the other from chromosome 16. Each linear chart is further stratified into samples, visually distinct through an array of colors. Crystal clear delineation of sample categories is provided in the legend. Bars are displayed against slightly transparent colored backgrounds (blue for the first chart, red for the second) to enhance visual appeal. This combination of circular and linear representations provides a comprehensive overview of the genomic dataset for effective exploration and analysis.
