This circular bar chart visualization displays genomic data from chromosome 12, covering intervals from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. It employs a multivec file with samples represented in different concentric rows. The chart encodes quantitative data through the height of bars, representing the 'peak' values. Each sample is distinguished by unique colors, aligning with the categorical field named 'sample.' The filtered samples exclude a specific category labeled as 'sample -.' The visualization utilizes a circular layout with different categories shown in separate concentric rings. Each category is easily identifiable by its distinct color, offering a clear view of genomic peak distributions across the specified range.
