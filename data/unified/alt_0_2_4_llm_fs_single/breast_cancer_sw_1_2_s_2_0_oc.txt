A linear genomic visualization displaying multiple tracks for chromosome 1. The first track is an ideogram showing cytobands, using colors like black, gray, and blue to indicate different chromosomal regions. The second track is a gene annotation, with directional triangles representing the strands; blue for positive and brown for negative, stratified by rows. The third track visualizes regions with copy number variations where a minor copy number in tumor is zero, highlighted in dark orange rectangles. The fourth track shows regions with higher total copy number in tumors depicted in green rectangles. The final track displays structural variations as connections between genomic positions, with colors indicating categories such as tandem-duplications (green) and translocations (blue).
