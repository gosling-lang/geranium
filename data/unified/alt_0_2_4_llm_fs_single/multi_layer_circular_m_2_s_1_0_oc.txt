A circular area chart displays a multivec file, representing chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The chart consists of six colored rows, each corresponding to different samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 6', 'sample 7', and 'sample 8'. The heights of the areas encode quantitative data (field 'peak'), and each row is distinctly colored to show categorical differences. The visualization is arranged in a circular layout with the genomic positions along the radial axis.
