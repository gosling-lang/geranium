The visualization is a linear, vertically arranged area chart displaying multivec data for chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. It represents genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative 'peak' values on the y-axis. The chart is stratified by rows, each corresponding to samples 1 through 4, with rows colored distinctively for each sample: yellow, green, blue, and purple. Each row's color corresponds to its sample category, and the visualization includes tooltips that provide genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample names. The display includes white strokes with a width of 0.5 around the area marks, and a legend is available to identify colors by sample.
