**Description**: 

The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view, arranged one above the other, showcasing genomic data for the hg19 assembly. 

The circular view includes five tracks: 
- An ideogram depicting the entire genome with a blue interactive brush linking to the linear view, which highlights chromosome 1. 
- A text annotation track titled "Putative Driver" showing genomic positions labeled with gene information.
- A range annotation track titled "Gain," highlighting genomic regions with sky blue rectangles.
- Another range annotation track for "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" using dark orange rectangles.
- A connection track illustrating genomic links with lines colored according to the data field "svclass," which includes categories such as "Gain," "LOH," "Translocation," "Duplication," "Deletion," "Inversion (TtT)," and "Inversion (HtH)."

The linear view provides nine tracks, mirroring the circular view's tracks and adding:
- A gene annotation track visualized with triangles and rectangles colored in gray.
- A scatter plot labeled "Point Mutation," which displays VCF file data with points colored by mutation subtype.
- The first of two additional annotation tracks shows "Insertion" and "Deletion" rows using yellow and green rectangles.
- The second annotation track titled "Copy Number Variants" visualizes CSV file data with light grey rectangles. 

These elements offer a comprehensive view of the genomic structure and variations across the annotated regions
