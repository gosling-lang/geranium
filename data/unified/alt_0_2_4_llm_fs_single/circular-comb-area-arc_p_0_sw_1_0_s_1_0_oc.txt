The visualization consists of a circular layout split into two vertical sections. The left section displays an area chart that uses data from a multivec file to show genomic positions ranging from 1 to 3,000,500 on chromosome 1. The chart has rows representing four samples, each colored distinctly to indicate different categories. The right section is a circular chart with connections that visualize chromosomal segment duplications from a CSV file. The connections span intervals on the x-axis from positions 103,900,000 to 104,100,000 on chromosome 1, with the color indicating different chromosomal origins. The visualization is static, with consistent arrangement and orientation, and includes tooltips for genomic and quantitative data exploration.
