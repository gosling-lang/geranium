A linear text chart visualizes a multivec file for the entire genome of hg38. The position of nucleotides 'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C' is encoded by the x-axis, with a genomic domain showing intervals. The y-axis represents the count of each nucleotide, displayed as text. Each nucleotide is colored uniquely based on its category, with 'A' in yellow, 'T' in green, 'G' in blue, and 'C' in pink. The chart's title is "Basic Marks: Text" and is subtitled "Tutorial Examples."
