The visualization displays a circular and a linear arrangement, representing genomic data from the hg19 assembly. The circular view includes multiple tracks: an ideogram, a textual annotation labeled 'Putative Driver,' and range tracks showing 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' with blue and orange rectangles, respectively. Additionally, it features line connections indicating structural variants in fields such as 'Translocation' and 'Deletion,' each color-coded based on the structural variant type.

Connected by a brush, the linear view focuses on chromosome 1, showcasing an ideogram, genomic annotations, and a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation.' This plot reflects the distance between mutations, with points colored by mutation subtype such as 'C>A' and 'T>G.' Following this, the view displays genomic features like copy number variants, insertions, and deletions. Each genomic feature is represented in various colors and shapes, with tooltips providing detailed metadata for interpreting the genomic data.
