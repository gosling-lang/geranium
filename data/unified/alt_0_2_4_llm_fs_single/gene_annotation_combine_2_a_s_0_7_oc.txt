The visualization consists of two genomic range annotation tracks in a horizontal layout, focusing on chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The left track, titled "Corces et al.," displays gene annotations with text labels. Genes on the positive strand are marked in blue, and those on the negative strand in red. Features include text, rectangles for exons, and lines connecting gene start and end. The right track, titled "GmGDV," similarly shows gene annotations using right triangles for genes on the positive strand and left triangles for the negative strand. Gene representations are color-coded based on strand orientation: blue for positive and red for negative. The layout is linear, with features stratified by strand category.
