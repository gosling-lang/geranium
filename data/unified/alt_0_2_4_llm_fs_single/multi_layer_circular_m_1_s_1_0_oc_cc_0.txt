A circular line chart displays genomic data for chromosome 12, ranging from positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. This visualization uses a multivec file to show expression levels across different samples on the y-axis, stratified by eight categories. Different lines represent these samples, each distinguished by unique colors, such as blue, orange, and green. The chart's radial design effectively conveys quantitative data through a striking visual arrangement.
