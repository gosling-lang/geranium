A circular visualization displays genomic data from chromosome 1 (position 1 to 3,000,500) using lines and points to represent expression values. The visualization is arranged in a vertical layout with multiple rows, each representing a different sample: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The expression values are encoded both in the height of the points and in the size, with the color indicating the category. This plot features an interactive legend to distinguish each sample, using a circular arrangement to depict the data in a compact and informative manner.
