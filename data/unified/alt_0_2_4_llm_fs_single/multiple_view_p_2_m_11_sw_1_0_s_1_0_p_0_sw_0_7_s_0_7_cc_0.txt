A visualization titled "Visual Linking" demonstrates interactive genomic data visualization. The display consists of three charts: an area chart, a circular line chart, and a scatter plot, all linked via interactive brushes. The area chart, in a linear layout, represents genomic intervals on the x-axis and quantitative expression values on the y-axis. Stratified by sample, each category is distinctively color-coded. In parallel, a circular line chart visually encodes genomic data with lines, maintaining the stratified color scheme. Users can manipulate the brush to update views dynamically. A scatter plot at the bottom shows detailed view data for the chromosome 1 region between 160,000,000 and 200,000,000. Each point correlates to genomic positions and expression values, further categorized by color. This interconnected visualization leverages multivec file data, employing the hg38 assembly.
