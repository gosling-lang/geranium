A circular and linear view are vertically arranged, connected by a blue interactive brush in the circular view. The circular view displays the entire genome, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. The circular view contains five tracks: an ideogram, a point annotation track for driver genes, and two range annotation tracks for 'Gain' (blue) and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' (orange), along with a line-connection track displaying structural variations. The categories depicted include 'Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion'. In the linear view, the ideogram, gene annotations, point mutations, indels, copy number variants, and additional track for gains and losses are laid out, illustrating detailed genomic features and variations.
