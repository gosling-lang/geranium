The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view, aligned vertically, linked by an interactive brush in the circular view. The circular view depicts the entire hg19 genome with tracks representing ideogram annotations, putative driver mutations, gain, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) regions, and structural variations. Rectangles and line connections encode genomic data, with colors differentiating categories such as gain (blue), LOH (orange), translocation (gray), duplication (green), deletion (blue), and inversion (red and purple).

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, displaying detailed tracks for ideogram annotations, putative driver mutations, point mutations, insertions, deletions, and copy number variants (CNVs). This view provides in-depth analysis of genomic features, with overlays illustrating complex interactions and annotations on the chromosome. The point mutation track shows variations in distance to previous mutations, with points colored by subtype, while CNVs are highlighted as gray-level variations indicating total copy number. The layout facilitates comprehensive genomic data exploration through interactive and color-coded representations.
