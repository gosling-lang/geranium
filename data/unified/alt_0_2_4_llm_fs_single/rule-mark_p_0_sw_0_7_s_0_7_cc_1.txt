A linear visualization featuring a bar chart overlaid with rules. The bar chart shows genomic intervals on the x-axis and peak expressions on the y-axis, colored in purple. Overlaid are horizontal and vertical dashed lines, denoting specific genomic positions and values. The purple lines indicate varying stroke widths, while pink lines have a uniform stroke width of 2. The visualization bears the title "Rule Mark" and the subtitle "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines," reflecting its focus on providing detailed annotations on genomic data.
