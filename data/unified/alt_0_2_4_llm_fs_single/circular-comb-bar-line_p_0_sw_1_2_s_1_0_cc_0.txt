A circular layout features two tracks visualizing a multivec dataset across chromosome 1 with an interval from 1 to 3,000,500. The left track is a circular bar chart showing genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis with bars. Colors represent different samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The right track combines a circular line chart and circular scatter plot. Both tracks display genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Lines and points are color-coded by sample, with the size of points indicating expression magnitude. The layout is stratified into rows corresponding to sample categories, enhancing categorical comparison.
