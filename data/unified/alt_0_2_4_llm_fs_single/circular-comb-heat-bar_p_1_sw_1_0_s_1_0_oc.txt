A circular visualization showing genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The left chart is a circular bar plot, displaying four samples in distinct rows, each colored uniquely. The genomic positions are on the x-axis, and peak expressions are on the y-axis. On the right, a circular heatmap represents the same genomic range with expression values indicated by color intensity. Both charts stratify data by samples with categories visually distinguished by colors. The assembly used is hg38, and the layout is circular with a vertical arrangement.
