A circular scatter plot presents genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. It is stratified by rows into four samples, each represented by a different color: blue, orange, green, and red. The points' position and size encode quantitative values from the data field 'peak', with varying opacity. A legend illustrates the color scheme for easy identification.
