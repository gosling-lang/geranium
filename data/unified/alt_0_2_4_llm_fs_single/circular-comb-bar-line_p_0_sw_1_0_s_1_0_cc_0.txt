A circular visualization displays genomic data across chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. The view features two horizontal charts. On the left, a circular bar chart represents different sample categories ('sample 1' to 'sample 4') with bars colored in blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. This reflects expression levels on the y-axis. The chart incorporates a tooltip displaying genomic positions and peak values. On the right, a circular overlay of a line chart and scatter plot utilizes the same color scheme to depict expression levels with lines and size-variable points for additional data granularity. The layout is static with interactive legends for categorical distinctions, highlighting the variations in expression among the samples.
