A circular line chart visually represents a multivec file, displaying chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. This chart utilizes a circular layout with multiple rows, each corresponding to samples 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8. The peaks are plotted on the lines, reflecting numerical values on the y-axis. Each sample is depicted by a distinct colored line, filtered to exclude certain samples, labeled "sample -." The visualization features a nominal data encoding, providing a comprehensive view of genomic data across multiple samples.
