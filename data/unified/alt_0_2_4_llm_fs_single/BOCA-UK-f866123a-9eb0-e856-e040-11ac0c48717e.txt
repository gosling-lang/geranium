A complex visualization consisting of a circular and a linear arrangement. The circular view shows chromosome-wide data with five tracks, including an ideogram, a point annotation track, two range annotation tracks for 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' and a line-connection track highlighting structural variations like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.' The brush on the ideogram links to the linear view, which focuses on chromosome 1. The linear view includes an ideogram, text annotations for 'Putative Driver' mutations, a scatter plot displaying mutation types by point colors, and additional tracks for 'Insertion,' 'Deletion,' 'Copy Number Variants,' and structural variants with connection lines. Different data transformations are applied to visualize various genomic features, enhancing the interpretability of complex genomic interactions.
