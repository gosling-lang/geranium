A vertical bar chart in a linear layout displays genomic data from chromosome 1, covering the region from position 1 to 3,000,500. Each bar's height indicates a quantitative value called 'peak,' with categories distinguished by color. Four sample categories, 'sample 1' through 'sample 4,' are represented in blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The chart includes an x-axis labeled with genomic positions and a y-axis with a quantitative scale. An interactive legend is included for categorical identification, enabling detailed analysis through tooltips displaying start and end genomic positions, peak values, and sample names.
