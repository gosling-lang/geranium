The visualization consists of parallel linear charts displaying data across five chromosomes (chr1 to chr5) using multivec files. Each chart has two tracks: an area chart and an ideogram. The area charts, representing genomic peaks for samples 1 to 4, are color-coded for different samples in shades of blue, orange, green, and red. The ideograms beneath display genomic bands with annotations. Text labels in black indicate band names, while rectangles show density with varying shades from white to black. Maroon triangles mark centromeric regions on both ends. Individual chromosome tracks maintain a width range from 518 to 700 pixels, reflecting data over specific genomic domains. The static layout with a center radius of 0.2 is consistent throughout, ensuring uniform style and organization.
