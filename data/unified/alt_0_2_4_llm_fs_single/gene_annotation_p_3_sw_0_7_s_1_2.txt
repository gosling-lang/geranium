The linear visualization consists of two vertical panels, each displaying multiple genomic range annotation tracks. The data represents a region on chromosome 3, between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000.

**First Panel:**
1. **GmGDV Track:** Displays gene annotations, with blue and red arrows indicating gene direction based on strand orientation. Gene names are labeled, and small triangles represent the orientation.
   
2. **Corces et al. Track:** Similar to GmGDV, it uses a smaller font size for gene names. Directional boxes and lines are used, colored based on strand orientation in dark blue and red.

3. **Blank Track:** Displays genomic ranges without annotations, using dark gray bars.

**Second Panel:**
1. **Cyverse-QUBES Track:** Displays gene data with black text for gene names and various visual elements like triangles and rectangles in light gray to mark gene locations and exons.
   
2. **HiGlass Track:** Uses faded colors (blue and red) for chromosome visualization, with directional triangles and assorted rectangles highlighting gene structure.
   
3. **IGV Track:** Presents gene information using bold navy text and rectangles. Arrows in white lines show gene direction.

Each track is stratified by rows, with categories visually distinguished through color coding, representing strand orientation and genetic features.
