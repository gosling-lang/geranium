The visualization consists of three linear bar charts arranged horizontally, each representing genomic intervals. The charts illustrate data from a multivec file focusing on chromosomes 9 and 12, spanning the intervals from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The expression values are encoded on the y-axis with pink bars, while genomic positions are displayed along the x-axis. The bars have white strokes and a stroke width of 0.5. The visual encoding is consistent across all charts, utilizing a responsive design that adjusts vertically when the width is less than 1200 pixels. This arrangement facilitates comparison across different genomic regions.
