The visualization is a circular chart in a vertical arrangement, depicting genomic connections on chromosome 1 from positions 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. The chart features links between these regions, with colors distinguishing different categories. These categories are mapped onto a range of colors including blue, orange, green, and purple. The opacity of connections is set low, allowing overlapping visualization. The circular design centers on a specified radius, with a black outline on the connections, visualizing data from a CSV source related to chromosome fields. The static nature of the display suggests non-interactive use.
