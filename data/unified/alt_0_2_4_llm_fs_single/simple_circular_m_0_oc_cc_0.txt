A circular visualization depicting genomic data features two tracks. The outer track is a circular scatter plot highlighting genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Different categories are represented by points in multiple colors. The inner track is a circular ideogram showing genomic intervals, with rectangles in various colors indicating distinct categories. The layout is set with a center radius of 0.6 and spacing of 5, supporting a multi-sample dataset across the genome with visual emphasis on chromosome 1. The assembly used is hg38, and interactive elements are linked within the chart for detailed exploration.
