A linear layout visualization titled "Example: Brushing and Linking" connects two line charts via an interactive brush. The top chart spans the entire chromosome 1, displaying genomic positions on the x-axis and peak expression values on the y-axis, with a linked brush highlighting a selected region. The bottom chart focuses on a detailed view of the chosen region (from 200,000,000 to 220,000,000 on chromosome 1), allowing for close examination of expression patterns. Both charts use data from a multivec file and render the line marks in a steel blue theme, with the selected region in the top chart accentuated by a steel blue background.
