A linear visualization showcasing several genomic data tracks for chromosome 1 of the hg38 assembly. The top track is an ideogram presenting distinct chromosomal bands in various colors corresponding to different stains. Key bands like gneg, gpos, and gvar are represented in specific shades. An annotation track displays gene orientations with triangles, colored and aligned according to strands. Further down are copy number variant (CNV) tracks. The first CNV track highlights regions with zero minor copy number in green rectangles. The second highlights total copy numbers within a specified range in purple. The bottom track visualizes structural variations with arc connections, where different colors and strokes indicate classes like 'tandem-duplication', 'translocation', 'deletion', and 'inversion.'
