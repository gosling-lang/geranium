A circular visualization displays genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning from 1 to 3,000,500. The layout is divided into two sections. On the left, an area chart separated by four samples ('sample 1' to 'sample 4') is displayed using distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The height of each area represents quantitative values for 'peak,' reflective of genomic positions. On the right, a circular chart connects genomic intervals with color-coded links representing different categories of start positions within a predefined chromosomal region (103,900,000 to 104,100,000). The visualization effectively uses color to differentiate between categories and samples, providing a detailed representation of multivec and connection data.
