The visualization is composed of two horizontal tracks arranged in a linear layout, representing genomic data from chromosome 2. The top track is a line chart displaying multivec data across three samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The data is represented with distinct line colors: blue, orange, and green, respectively. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis depicts quantitative expression values. Each line represents data stratified by sample, with colors assigned accordingly and a thin white stroke outlining the lines.

The bottom track features an area chart for 'sample 1' and 'sample 2', portrayed using blue and orange colors, respectively. Similarly, the x-axis shows the genomic positions, and the y-axis illustrates expression values with area fill. Both tracks share a unified genomic domain, enabling comparative analysis of sample-specific variations along chromosome 2. The charts are enriched by a nominal legend that provides color-coded sample identification, enhanced by consistent white strokes for visual clarity.
