Based on the provided specifications and classifications, here is a detailed description:

This circular bar chart visualizes genomic data using a vector file, covering the hg38 genome assembly. The chart's layout is circular with a stacked alignment, and it is static with a center radius set at 0.3. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis displays quantitative data, specifically the 'peak' values. The bars are uniformly sky blue in color, and the visualization spans a width and height of 700 units each. The chart effectively displays variations in genomic expression, providing insights into distribution patterns along the genomic axis. The design includes no interactive elements, offering a straightforward representation of the data.
