The visualization is a linear, horizontal layout focusing on a specific genomic region on chromosome 3, between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. It consists of a single view titled "Corces et al." The view contains an overlay of tracks displaying gene annotations from a BED database. Genes on the positive strand are depicted in blue and on the negative strand in red. Each gene is represented with its name as text, positioned above and below the genomic coordinates based on strand orientation. Rectangles denote gene boundaries, while exons are explicitly illustrated with larger rectangles within each gene. Horizontal rules under each gene illustrate the full extent of the genomic region they occupy. The chart uses color to distinguish strand types: blue for positive and red for negative strands. The track is stratified into two rows, separating the positive and negative strands, enhancing visual clarity in distinguishing gene orientation.
