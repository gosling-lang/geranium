This visualization is a heat map titled 'HFFc6_Micro-C', representing genomic interactions using a matrix format. It displays the human genome assembly hg38, with both the x- and y-axes depicting genomic intervals. The color intensity of each rectangular cell encodes the quantitative values of the genomic interactions, with the color scale ranging through hues represented by the 'hot' palette. This chart helps in visualizing the interaction strength or frequency between different genomic regions.
