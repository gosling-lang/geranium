A vertically arranged linear visualization displays genomic data across chromosome 1, from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a heat map, showing expression values as color intensities, stratified by categories labeled 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The bottom track is a bar chart, displaying quantitative expression values on the y-axis with bars. It is also stratified by the same categories, each represented by distinct colors. Both tracks provide detailed information through tooltips for genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample names.
