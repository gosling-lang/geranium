The visualization titled "Example: Brushing and Linking" consists of two line charts arranged in a linear layout. Each chart represents multivec data of chromosome 1.

1. **Top Chart**: Displays a genomic line chart where the x-axis represents positions on chromosome 1, and the y-axis shows quantitative values from a field named 'peak.' The line is colored sky blue. It includes an interactive brush linked to the bottom chart, highlighting regions.

2. **Bottom Chart**: Also depicts a genomic line chart, covering a specific interval on chromosome 1, between 200,000,000 and 220,000,000. The data is visualized with green lines, and the chart has a slightly lighter blue background to indicate interaction readiness.

The brushing and linking feature allows users to interactively select regions in one chart and see the corresponding data in the other, enhancing data exploration.
