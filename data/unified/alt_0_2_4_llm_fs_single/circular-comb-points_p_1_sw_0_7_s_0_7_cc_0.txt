A circular visualization consisting of two tracks displays genomic data using multivec format. Each track represents the same chromosome 1 region from position 1 to 3,000,500. The left track is a circular scatter plot where expression values are encoded as point size and position on the y-axis, with categories shown in different colors. The right track is another circular scatter plot, featuring stratified rows for each category. Colors differentiate 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' Points are semi-transparent, with an opacity of 0.5. Tooltip information includes genomic positions and sample details.
