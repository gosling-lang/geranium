The visualization features a circular and linear arrangement for visualizing genomic data from the hg19 assembly. The circular ideogram provides a comprehensive overview of the genome. It links to a line-connection track visualizing structural variations like 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH).' These variations are displayed in distinct colorsâ€”sky blue for 'Gain' and orange for 'LOH.' 

In the linear view, a series of annotation tracks detail specific genomic regions. A 'Putative Driver' track displays gene names, while a 'Point Mutation' scatter plot highlights mutations with color-coded subtypes. Additional tracks include 'Gain' and 'LOH,' showing genomic ranges with varying rectangle shades. The line-connection track is repeated here, illustrating connections across chromosome regions. Each component of the visualization is interactive, maximizing data exploration and analysis.
