The visualization is a heat map with a linear layout displaying genomic data using a matrix file from hg38 assembly. Both x and y axes represent genomic intervals without explicit axes shown. The data values are encoded with a color gradient ranging from light to intense hues, mapped to a 'hot' color range. The chart is titled 'HFFc6_Micro-C' and spans a width of 720 pixels and a height of 600 pixels, showing the intensity of expression values with varying color intensities.
