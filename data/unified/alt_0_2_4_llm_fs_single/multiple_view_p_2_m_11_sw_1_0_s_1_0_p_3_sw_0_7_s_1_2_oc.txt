The visualization titled "Visual Linking" displays genomic data using a vertical arrangement of interconnected views. The top section features a linear scatter plot highlighting chromosome 1, focused between positions 160,000,000 to 200,000,000. Data points reflect quantitative peaks colored by sample categories across a y-axis. Below, two horizontally arranged views include a circular line chart and an area chart, each with a brush for interactive detail linking. The circular chart connects data between genomic intervals, while the linear area chart visualizes peaks across samples, allowing exploration of genomic ranges with coordinated interaction. The visualization effectively links detailed and overview representations in a multi-sample context.
