A linear layout visualization displays genomic data along chromosome 1, from positions 1 to 3,000,500, with two distinct tracks: a stratified bar chart and a line chart. The top track, a multi-row bar chart, features four samples labeled 'sample 1' to 'sample 4.' Each row is colored distinctly in blue, orange, green, and red. The bars, representing peak values, also vary in size according to quantitative data, providing visual differentiation. The bottom track is a line chart that depicts expression values along the genome, with lines colored in matching sample colors. Both tracks include interactive tooltips that offer genomic positions and value details, enhancing data exploration.
