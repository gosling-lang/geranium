The visualization is a text chart titled "Basic Marks: Text," featuring a linear layout with genomic intervals on the x-axis. It displays categorical data (A, T, G, C) from a multivec data source, with each category represented by a distinct color. The quantitative expression is shown on the y-axis at positions where text characters indicating bases are placed. The genomic range is encoded through the fields "start" and "end," while the expression values are derived from the "count" field. The chart includes a top axis for genomic alignment and adjustable height and width (672x156 pixels) for flexible visualization.
