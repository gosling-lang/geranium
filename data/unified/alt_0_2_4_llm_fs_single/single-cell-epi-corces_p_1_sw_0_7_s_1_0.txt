The visualization titled "Single-cell Epigenomic Analysis" from "Corces et al. 2020" is presented in a vertical linear layout, focusing on chromosome 3 from position 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. It includes multiple bar charts representing different cell types such as excitatory neurons (orange), inhibitory neurons (green), dopaminergic neurons (purple), microglia (cyan), oligodendrocytes (violet), astrocytes (red), and OPCs (pink), depicting peak signals from bigwig data files. A gene annotation track is overlaid, displaying gene names with strand direction indicated by colors: blue for positive and red for negative. Below, PLAC-seq data for H3K4me3 marks in oligodendrocytes, microglia, and neurons are shown as translucent connection tracks in different hues. An ideogram of chromosome 3 highlights the cytoband patterns, featuring a red brush to interactively link detailed views. Overall, this visualization provides a comprehensive view of epigenomic data across various neural cell types and genomic regions, employing color and spatial alignment for clarity.
