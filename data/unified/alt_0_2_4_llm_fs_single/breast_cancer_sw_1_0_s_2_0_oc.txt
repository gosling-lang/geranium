A comprehensive linear layout visualization displays genomic data for chromosome 1 using various tracks. The ideogram track, colored in shades of gray and black, utilizes rectangles and triangles to denote cytogenetic bands. The gene annotation track shows genes with right and left triangles, distinguished by strand direction and colored in shades of blue and beige. Two copy number variation (CNV) tracks represent tumor data: regions in dark orange depict areas with loss of heterozygosity, and green areas illustrate high-copy-number gains. Interconnected lines, colored based on structural variation classes like 'tandem-duplication' and 'translocation,' represent genomic rearrangements. This visualization uses data from CSV sources linked to genomic annotations, emphasizing six different data-driven categories.
