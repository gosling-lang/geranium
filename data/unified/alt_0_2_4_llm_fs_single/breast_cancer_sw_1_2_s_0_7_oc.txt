The linear visualization comprises five tracks focused on chromosome 1 using the hg38 assembly. The first track is an ideogram displaying chromosomal bands with colors representing different stain categories, such as gneg and acen. Arrows, in the form of right and left triangles, indicate the centromere position. The second track is a gene annotation track, stratified by strand, with triangles showing gene directions colored in light blue and beige, representing positive and negative strands, respectively. 

Following, two range annotation tracks display structural variants, with the first highlighting regions of loss in dark orange and the second showing gain in green, encoded from a CSV file. At the bottom, connections visualize genomic rearrangements, with lines colored by class, such as tandem-duplication and translocation, providing an interactive exploration of structural variations.
