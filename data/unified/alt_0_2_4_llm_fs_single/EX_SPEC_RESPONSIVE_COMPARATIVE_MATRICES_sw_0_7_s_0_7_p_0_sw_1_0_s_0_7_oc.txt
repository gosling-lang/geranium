A genomic matrix visualization in a linear layout, displaying two overlaid Hi-C interaction matrices for chromosome 10. The left lower matrix uses a grey color scale to encode interaction frequencies, while the right upper matrix employs a hot color scale for the same purpose. The x and y axes both represent genomic positions on chromosome 10, with intervals indicating specific regions. The visualization includes interactive elements with responsive sizing, allowing for adjustments based on the width of the display. Legends are provided for both color scales to interpret the frequency values. Multiple overlaid tracks enhance the depiction of genomic data.
