The visualization, titled 'Basic Marks: Triangles', is a genomic position annotation track in a linear layout. It showcases annotations based on gene strand direction using right and left triangles, representing the '+' and '-' strands, respectively. The data is sourced from a BEDDB file. The track is stratified by rows for each strand direction, with the colors blue and orange indicating the '+' and '-' strands. Each triangle's position maps to genomic coordinates on the x-axis. The layout is interactive and non-static, allowing for dynamic exploration of the data.
