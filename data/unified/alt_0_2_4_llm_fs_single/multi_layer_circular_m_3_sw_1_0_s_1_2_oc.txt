A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file showing chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart includes multiple tracks representing different samples, stratified by rows. Each row corresponds to a sample and is color-coded for categories named 'sample 1' through 'sample 16.' The position of bars along the x-axis represents genomic start and end points, while the height encodes the quantitative value 'peak.' The visualization features multiple opacity levels to differentiate value ranges and includes a right-sided quantitative axis. This interactive and stratified layout facilitates comparative analysis of genomic data, as referenced in Javed et al.'s study on graphical perception of multiple time series.
