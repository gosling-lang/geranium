A multilayer linear visualization shows genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500 in the hg38 assembly. The top layer is a bar chart tracking four samples, each represented by different colored bars: blue, orange, green, and red. These colors signify 'sample 1' through 'sample 4'. The y-axis encodes quantitative peak values, while the x-axis represents genomic positions. The bottom layer is a heat map where color intensity, ranging through a 'hot' color scale, indicates expression values across the same genomic interval. Both tracks are stratified by sample, with additional tooltips providing genomic start and end positions, quantified values, and sample identifiers.
