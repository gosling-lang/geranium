The visualization titled "Visual Linking" uses a vertical arrangement to interconnect linear and circular views. The top section consists of two horizontally arranged charts: a linear area chart and a circular line chart, both visualizing data from chromosome 1. The linear chart displays genomic intervals with areas colored for categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4', linked by an interactive brush to the other chart. The circular chart presents samples in concentric lines, also linked by a brush, allowing dynamic interaction. The bottom section shows a detailed linear scatter plot focusing on chromosome 1 between positions 160,000,000 and 200,000,000. Colored points represent expression values, stratified by sample categories. This interactive setup, built with multivec data, highlights genomic positions and peak values through visualization and data linkage.
