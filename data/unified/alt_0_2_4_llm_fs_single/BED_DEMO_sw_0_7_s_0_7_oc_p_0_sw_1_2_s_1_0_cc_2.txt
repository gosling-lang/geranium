A vertical arrangement of four linear tracks showcases BED files on chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 2,000,000. The first track titled "BED12: All 12 standard fields" presents genomic ranges as purple rectangles. The second track, "BED6: A file with the first 6 BED fields," uses pink rectangles. The third track, "BED6+6: A file with the first 6 BED fields, and 6 custom fields," displays ranges in green rectangles. Finally, the track "BED12+1: A file with all 12 standard fields, and a single extra custom field" again uses pink rectangles. All tracks visualize intervals on the x-axis, with consistent size, stroke, and width parameters for clarity and visual cohesion.
