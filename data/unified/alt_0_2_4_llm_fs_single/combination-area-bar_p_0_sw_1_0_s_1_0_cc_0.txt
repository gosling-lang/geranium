A linear visualization displays two tracks for chromosome 1, covering the range from 1 to 3,000,500. The top track features an area chart divided into four rows representing 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'. Each area is color-coded: blue for sample 1, orange for sample 2, green for sample 3, and red for sample 4, displaying genomic positions on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis. The lower track is a bar chart with similar categorical and color arrangements. It shows peak ranges using bars for minimum and maximum values, enhancing comparative analysis across samples. The interactive tooltip provides genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample identification.
