A circular visualization displays genomic data resembling a Circos plot. It includes three primary tracks: a bar chart, an ideogram, and a connection chart. The bar chart depicts genomic positions with quantitative peaks, colored in pale yellow. The ideogram represents chromosome bands, with rectangles color-coded by stain types, such as gneg, gpos, and acen. The connection chart overlays within-link connections between genomic positions, with lines colored differently based on chromosome pairs. Overall, the layout offers a compact visual interaction with multiple genomic aspects, enhancing data interpretation.
