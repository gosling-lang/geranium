The visualization consists of a circular view and a linear view aligned vertically. The circular view includes a genomic ideogram, text annotations, range annotations for 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)', and structural connections. The ideogram displays genomic intervals with a blue interactive brush linking to the linear view. The range annotations are depicted with blue and orange rectangles. The connection lines represent structural variations like 'Translocation' and 'Inversion'. In the linear view, an ideogram shows chromosome 1, with text annotations, genomic range annotations, and a scatter plot for point mutations. The scatter plot visualizes VCF data, with points colored based on mutation subtypes. Additionally, the linear view provides details on copy number variants, insertions, and deletions using gray rectangles. Both views collectively illustrate genomic features across chromosome 1.
