A Hi-C matrix in a linear layout visualizes genomic interactions using a matrix file. Genomic intervals are displayed on both x- and y-axes, spanning from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000. The color intensity represents expression values, following a 'hot' color range. Annotations include purple vertical and green horizontal lines that mark specific genomic points. Additional tracks overlay bar marks highlighting specific regions of genomes (chr6, chr7, and chr8) with color encoding of quantitative values. Points are overlaid, with sizes determined by another quantitative value 'v', and are pink with white strokes. The title is "Hi-C Matrix," with the subtitle "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations."
