The visualization titled "Gremlin (O'Brien et al. 2010)" features a linear layout comprising multiple interconnected views. The top view is an ideogram of Chromosome 5, showcasing genomic intervals with color-coded rectangles representing different staining patterns. Adjacent text annotations display chromosomal names aligned according to stain categories. A brush interaction links to the subsequent charts.

Below the ideogram, additional tracks depict data from various chromosomes (hs5, hs4, hs6) using curved connections and color-coded by source chromosome. The middle view, titled "Region of Interest," displays focused genomic intervals from Chromosome 5 (68-71 million bp), illustrating linked structures with blue and green arcs based on specific categories. The bottom view, "Rearrangement View," zooms further into Chromosome 5, emphasizing intricate chromosomal rearrangements with thick blue connections.

These views are intricately linked through interactive mechanisms, like brushing, facilitating dynamic exploration of chromosomal structure and rearrangement. The overall design reflects a meticulous arrangement of data showing genomic complexity, with elliptical link styles highlighting connections.
