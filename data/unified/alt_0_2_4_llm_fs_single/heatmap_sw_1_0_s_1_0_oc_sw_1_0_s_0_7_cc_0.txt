The visualization is a heat map titled "HFFc6_Micro-C," displaying genomic interactions. It uses a matrix data type sourced from a URL. The genomic positions are mapped on both the x- and y-axes without specified axis marks, covering the entire hg38 genome. Color intensity represents quantitative expression values, using a "hot" color range for visual encoding. The chart is rectangular, with dimensions of 420x420 pixels and arranged in a linear orientation.
