The visualization is a circular bar chart showing genomic data for chromosome 1 within the interval 1 to 3,000,500. It features a histogram for two samples, 'sample 1' and 'sample 2,' with data from a multivec file. Bars represent genomic intervals on the x-axis, with height encoding 'peak_min' and 'peak_max' values on the y and ye-axes. The chart is stratified by rows, distinguished by color corresponding to each sample. Bars have black strokes with a width of 0.2. The layout is static with a central radius of 0.5, and a legend to indicate sample categories is included.
