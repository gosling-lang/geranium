The visualization consists of two circular charts representing genomic data across chromosome 1 from base 1 to 3,000,500. The left chart is a circular bar plot, with different colored bars representing expression values for four samples ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'). Each sample is depicted in its own row arranged circularly. The bars' height indicates quantitative expression values. The right chart is a circular heatmap, where color intensity encodes expression values within genomic intervals. Different shades represent varying levels of expression, stratified by sample categories. Both charts provide interactive tooltips offering detailed genomic start and end positions, expression values, and sample information for enhanced data exploration.
