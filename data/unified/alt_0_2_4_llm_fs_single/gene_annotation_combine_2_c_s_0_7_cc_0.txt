The visualization consists of two horizontal genomic range annotation tracks titled 'HiGlass' and 'Cyverse-QUBES,' both displaying data from chromosome 3, between 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The left chart utilizes color-coding to differentiate strands, showing positive strands in blue and negative strands in orange. Tracks feature arrows to indicate gene direction, text labels for gene names, and rectangles for genes and exons. The right chart displays similar data, but with a different color scheme: right triangles in pink, left triangles in purple, text in sky blue, and rectangles in the same sky blue. The tracks are stratified by strand orientation.
