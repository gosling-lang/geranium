A multi-view genomic visualization in a linear layout displays data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is an area chart showing expression data with different colors for four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The x-axis represents genomic position, while the y-axis denotes expression values. Below, an overlay scatter plot and bar chart represent the same samples with rows stratified for categorical differentiation. Points and bars depict expression levels, and colors indicate sample identity. Tooltip integration provides genomic position, value, and sample details.
