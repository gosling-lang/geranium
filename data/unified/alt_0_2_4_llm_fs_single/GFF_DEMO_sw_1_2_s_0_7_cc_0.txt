A linear visualization of an E. coli genome segment displays genes using a GFF3 file. The x-axis represents the genomic interval from 222,000 to 240,000 base pairs on chromosome U00096.3. Genes appear as blue arrows for forward strand and orange arrows for reverse strand. Gene names are labeled above each gene, positioned within their genomic ranges. The chart includes tracks with right and left triangles indicating gene direction, and lines showing gene spans. Genes are color-coded by biotypes, such as protein-coding and rRNA, enhancing the genome overview. The title is 'GFF3 file,' with the subtitle 'E. coli genome, colored by gene type.'
