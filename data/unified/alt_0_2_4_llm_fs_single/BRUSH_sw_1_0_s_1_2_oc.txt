The visualization consists of two linear genomic line charts stacked vertically, illustrating data from chromosome 1. The top chart displays the entire chromosome with expression values encoded as line plots. An interactive brush area is highlighted in steel blue, allowing selection and linking to the lower chart. The bottom chart focuses on a zoomed-in region, specifically between 200,000,000 and 220,000,000 bases on chromosome 1, providing a detailed view of expression values. The title, "Example: Brushing and Linking," emphasizes interaction, where the brushing feature links the two charts visually and functionally. Both use data from a multivec file, with expression peaks plotted on the y-axis.
