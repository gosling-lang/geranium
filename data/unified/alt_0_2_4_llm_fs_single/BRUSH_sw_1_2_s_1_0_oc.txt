The visualization titled "Example: Brushing and Linking" consists of two linear line charts arranged vertically, both showing genomic data. The top chart displays the entire chromosome 1 on the x-axis with genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative values (peak values). An interactive brush, colored in steel blue, overlays the top chart, allowing for a selection that links to the bottom chart, focusing on a specific interval between 200,000,000 and 220,000,000 on chromosome 1. The bottom chart, with a background of light steel blue, mirrors the selected range in the top chart, providing a detailed view of the genomic data. Both charts visualize multivec data from a specified URL and display data from "sample 1" using line marks. The visualization facilitates interactive exploration of genomic regions, emphasizing the links between broader and detailed genomic views.
