A circular arrangement of two scatter plots visualizes a multivec dataset from chromosome 1, covering positions 1 to 3,000,500 in the hg38 assembly. Each scatter plot is stratified into rows based on four categories labeled 'sample 1' through 'sample 4.' The points on both plots encode genomic position as their x-coordinate and peak values as their y-coordinate, while size is also determined by peak values. The points are colored differently for each sample category, with the left plot lacking a grid and the right plot featuring one. Both plots share a common layout with circular axes, highlighting the stratification and differences in values through semi-transparent points. The opacity of points is set at 50%.
