The visualization is a scatter plot in a linear layout, part of the "Basic Marks: point" tutorial example. It displays a multivec file representing data from the entire genome of hg38. The x-axis shows genomic positions, while the y-axis displays quantitative expression values. Each pink point represents a data point, with size and color reflecting the 'peak' value from the data. The plot's title is "Basic Marks: point" and it includes a subtitle, "Tutorial Examples." The plot dimensions are 560 by 156 pixels.
