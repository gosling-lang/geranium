The visualization comprises a circular and linear view connected by an interactive brush in the circular ideogram, highlighting chromosome 1. The circular view features tracks: an annotated ideogram, a labeled chart titled "Putative Driver," and tracks showing genomic ranges for "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" with sky blue and orange rectangles respectively. Connection lines in various colors represent structural variations like translocations and deletions.

The linear view details chromosome 1 and includes a genomic ideogram, mutation annotations, a scatter plot for point mutations colored by subtype, and tracks for "Insertion" and "Deletion." A track titled "Copy Number Variants" represents quantitative data field values with gray bars. This view emphasizes genomic variation and associated annotations across chromosome 1.
