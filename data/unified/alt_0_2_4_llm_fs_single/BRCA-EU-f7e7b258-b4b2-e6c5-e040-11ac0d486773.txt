A circular and linear view are arranged vertically, linked by an interactive blue brush in the circular view. The circular view encompasses the entire genome, highlighting regions like 'Gain' in blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in red rectangles. It includes five tracks: an ideogram, a point annotation track, two range annotation tracks, and a line-connection track showing connections between genomic positions in distinct colors based on the 'svclass' field. The categories visualized include 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.'

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, comprising tracks similar to the circular view, plus additional features like a genomic range annotation track, a scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation' visualizing VCF data with points colored by 'SUBTYPE,' and tracks for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' mutations. The 'Copy Number Variants' track displays quantitative data fields, presented as gray rectangles. Both views provide a comprehensive overview of structural variations and genetic alterations, useful for detailed genomic analysis.
