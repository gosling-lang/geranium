A heat map in a linear layout visualizes a matrix file, showing genomic intervals between 800,000,000 and 1,800,000,000 base pairs. The x-axis and y-axis display genomic positions. The color intensity within the heat map represents quantitative values, following a 'hot' color scheme. The data is sourced from a URLspecific JSON file, and the visualization is interactive with configurable zoom limits.
