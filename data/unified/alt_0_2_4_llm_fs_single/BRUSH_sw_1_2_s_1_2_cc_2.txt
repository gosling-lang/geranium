A dual line chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec dataset, focusing on chromosome 1. The top chart displays the entire chromosome, while the bottom chart shows a zoomed-in segment between 200,000,000 and 220,000,000 using a blue brush for interaction. Both charts feature pink lines representing quantitative values from a sample category. The title is "Example: Brushing and Linking."
