The visualization, titled "Single-cell Epigenomic Analysis" with the subtitle "Corces et al. 2020," features a vertical linear layout. It showcases genomic data from chromosome 3, spanning positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. The top section includes seven bar charts, each representing different cell types: Excitatory neurons (orange), Inhibitory neurons (green), Dopaminergic neurons (purple), Microglia (sky blue), Oligodendrocytes (purple), Astrocytes (red), and OPCs (pink). Each chart visualizes expression peaks along the genomic interval with a specific color.

Beneath these, a gene annotation track displays genes with text labels, lines, and rectangles, color-coded by strand (blue for positive, red for negative). Following is a PLAC-seq chart, titled "PLAC-seq (H3K4me3) Nott et al," featuring connections between genomic positions depicted in pale strokes.

The lower part presents an ideogram of chromosome 3, detailing cytogenetic bands with different shades and marked with maroon triangles indicating centromeres. A red interactive brush links the ideogram to the detailed genomic view above, providing a cohesive integration between local and broader contexts.
