A circular area chart visualizes a multivec file focusing on chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. This visualization is composed of multiple concentric rows, each representing a different sample. The area within each row is color-coded based on the sample, using a nominal scale, to help distinguish between categories. The genomic positions are plotted along the circular x-axis, while the peak values, signifying expression, are plotted along the y-axis within each area. Notably, a data transformation filter excludes certain categories, providing a clearer focus on relevant data samples. The chart's layout emphasizes differentiation across samples through both row stratification and color representation, creating a visually informative genomic distribution.
