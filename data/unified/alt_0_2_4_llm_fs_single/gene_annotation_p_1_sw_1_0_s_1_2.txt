A linear visualization consisting of six genomic range annotation tracks is presented, focusing on chromosome 3, spanning positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. Each track is titled, providing distinct layers of genomic information. The chart titled "Corces et al." displays gene annotations with text and colored rectangles, blue for positive strands and red for negative strands. "IGV" uses navy-colored text and rectangles, while white lines with triangular patterns depict gene direction. "HiGlass" includes blue and red triangles and text to represent strand information, achieving opacity effects for better visualization. "GmGDV," also color-coded in blue and red, includes text and directional triangles. The "Cyverse-QUBES" chart uses grayscale for text and gray rectangles, highlighting exons in purple. Each track is stratified by the strand, encoding categories using colors for clarity.
