A circular visualization composed of two tracks displays genomic data across chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The left track is a circular heat map, where genomic intervals are represented by color intensity, indicating varying expression levels. The heat map is stratified into rows for categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The right track is a circular bar chart, showcasing genomic positions along the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Each category is visualized in a distinct color, corresponding to a specific sample, and the data is presented in a multi-row format for detailed comparison.
