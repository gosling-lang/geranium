The visualization displays a bar chart of genomic data across chromosome 12, between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The data is sourced from a multivec file and is color-coded by sample categories, featuring a spectrum that includes blue, orange, green, red, purple, and other hues. Each bar's height represents a quantitative measure of expression. The chart consists of multiple overlay tracks with varying opacity based on height thresholds, making it responsive to size. This chart is adapted from "Graphical perception of Multiple Time Series" by Javed et al., TVCG 2010.
