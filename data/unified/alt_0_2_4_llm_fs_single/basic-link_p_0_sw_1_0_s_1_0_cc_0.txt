The image presents a linear arc diagram titled "Basic Marks: Link," with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples." It visualizes genomic data from chromosome 1 using a CSV file. Arcs represent connections between genomic intervals, indicated by 's1' to 'e1' and 's2' to 'e2'. All arcs are uniformly colored in red (#fc8585), providing a visual link between the specified genomic positions. The layout is horizontal, occupying a space of 800 pixels in width and 180 pixels in height, with an additional margin for titles.
