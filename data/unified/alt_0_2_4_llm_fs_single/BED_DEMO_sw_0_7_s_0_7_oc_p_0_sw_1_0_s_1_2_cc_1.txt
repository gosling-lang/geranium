A linear layout showcasing four BED file tracks demonstrates different specifications. Each track represents genomic intervals from chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 2,000,000. The first track, titled "BED12: All 12 standard fields," features sky blue rectangles. The second track, "BED6: A file with the first 6 BED fields," displays green rectangles. The third track, "BED6+6: A file with the first 6 BED fields, and 6 custom fields," is shown with purple rectangles. Finally, "BED12+1: A file with all 12 standard fields, and a single extra custom field" also uses sky blue rectangles. Each track's rectangular markup is defined by the 'chromStart' and 'chromEnd' fields.
