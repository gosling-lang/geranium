A circular ideogram and a linked linear view visualize the genome assembly hg19. The circular view includes a track titled "Ideogram" with a blue brush tool, facilitating interaction with the linear view below. Both views display genomic variations. The circular view features "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" tracks with blue and orange rectangles, respectively, and a connections track indicating chromosomal rearrangements. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, displaying an ideogram, a scatterplot titled "Point Mutation," and a gene annotation track. The scatterplot distinguishes mutations using color-coding for types like "C>A" and "C>G." The view also includes "Copy Number Variants" bars and two additional tracks for "Gain" and "LOH," alongside complex structural variations visualized with links and color-coded categories.
