A linear line chart visualizes a multivec file, showing the entire genome of hg38 with a focus on 'sample 1'. The x-axis represents genomic positions across multiple chromosomes, while the y-axis displays quantitative 'peak' values. The lines, representing expression levels, are colored in pink, and their thickness is set to a value of 2. The chart is titled 'Basic Marks: line' and includes the subtitle 'Tutorial Examples'.
