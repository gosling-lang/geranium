The visualization is a circular line chart depicting genomic data from chromosome 12, spanning positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The data is visualized in multiple rows, each corresponding to different samples. The lines, colored in a diverse palette, represent the quantitative values of the 'peak' field. The circular layout includes a grid to indicate quantitative axis domains, with specific subdomains highlighting different value ranges. The visualization effectively contrasts multiple samples, leveraging color and line opacity to distinguish between them. The description references Javed et al.'s work on graphical perception of multiple time series, emphasizing the study's graphical methods.
