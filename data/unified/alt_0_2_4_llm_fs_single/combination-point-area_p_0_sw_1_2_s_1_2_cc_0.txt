The visualization consists of two vertically arranged tracks in a linear layout, displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a scatter plot where points represent genomic positions on the x-axis, with expression values encoded by their position on the y-axis and their size. Points are color-coded by sample categories and feature a semi-transparent opacity. Tooltip functionality provides detailed information about genomic positions and values.

The bottom track is an area chart divided into rows for each sample category. Each row shows expression values as filled areas, color-coded to match the sample categories, providing a visual comparison across four samples. The y-axis displays quantitative values, and stroke attributes are used to outline the areas. Both tracks utilize multivec data, enabling comprehensive genomic data exploration with detailed color legends indicating corresponding samples.
