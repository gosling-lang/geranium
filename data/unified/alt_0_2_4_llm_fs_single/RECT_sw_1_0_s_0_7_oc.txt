A linear ideogram chart visualizes a CSV file representing the chromosomal banding pattern of chromosome 1 in the hg38 assembly. The genomic positions are shown along the x-axis. Rectangles are colored to indicate different stain categories, such as gneg, gpos, and gvar. The chart is titled "Basic Marks: Rect" with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples." Each rectangle's color corresponds to a nominal data field named "Stain," with colors ranging from white to various shades of gray and black.
