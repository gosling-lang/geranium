The visualization comprises two interconnected views: a circular overview and a detailed linear view, linked via an interactive brush in the circular view. The circular layout presents the entire genome on hg19, featuring tracks such as ideograms, point annotations for driver mutations, and range annotations for copy number alterations like 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH).' These are visualized with blue and orange rectangles, respectively. Additionally, structural variants such as 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion' are depicted using curved links.

The linear view zooms into chromosome 1 and includes multiple tracks: ideograms, genomic annotations, scatter plots displaying mutation data, and range annotations for insertions and deletions in a VCF file. The scatter plot, titled 'Point Mutation,' illustrates the distance to previous mutations, with variant colors representing different mutation types. Furthermore, the linear view features range annotations for copy number variants and uses gray rectangles to indicate genomic ranges.

Overall, the visualization integrates genomic data across multiple dimensions and representations to facilitate detailed examination and analysis of genetic structures and variations.
