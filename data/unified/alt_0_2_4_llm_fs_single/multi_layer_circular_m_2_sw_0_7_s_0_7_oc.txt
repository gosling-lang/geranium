A circular area chart displays genomic data for chromosome 12 in the interval from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The data is visualized as areas representing different samples, with each sample colored distinctively. The chart contains multiple rings for categories labeled 'sample 1' to 'sample 16,' excluding a placeholder category 'sample -.' Each ring's area is stratified by opacity to denote different quantitative 'peak' domains, ranging from 0 to 0.01. The visualization serves as a reference for the graphical perception of multiple time series.
