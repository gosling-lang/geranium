A linear visualization containing five tracks provides a comprehensive genomic overview focusing on chromosome 1. It includes an ideogram with colored regions indicating different staining patterns, and left and right triangles marking specific features. A gene annotation track follows, showing gene direction with blue rightward and orange leftward triangles. Two copy number variant tracks highlight genomic regions: a purple track for segments where the minor copy number is zero in tumors, and a green track where the total copy number is high. Finally, a track with connections displays genomic rearrangements in chromosome 1. The colors and strokes of these connections reveal different structural variants such as 'tandem-duplication' and 'translocation' based on the data field 'svclass.'
