**Description**: 

A circular heatmap, titled "Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts" with a subtitle "Heatmap," displays genomic data from chromosome 1 within the interval of 1 to 3,000,500. The visualization uses a circular layout with rectangular marks to represent data points. Each rectangle corresponds to a genomic position and its intensity is encoded by the color, transitioning from purple to yellow, indicating varying levels of the 'peak' value, a quantitative measure. The chart is stratified into multiple rows based on categories, which include 'sample 1' to 'sample 4.' This layout is designed for clarity, allowing for easy identification of patterns across different genomic samples on a fixed circular axis. The circular arrangement, with a center radius of 0.5, emphasizes the continuity and cyclical nature of genomic data. The visualization is static and does not permit zooming, fixed at the assembly version hg38.
