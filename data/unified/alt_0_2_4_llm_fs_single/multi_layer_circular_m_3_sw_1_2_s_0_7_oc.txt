The circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file, representing genomic data on chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The layout is composed of multiple concentric layers, each depicting rows of data samples. Different samples are assigned various colors, which represent distinct categories. The height of the bars along the radial axis encodes quantitative values of "peak" expression data. The chart incorporates data transformation, filtering out specific samples marked as "sample -," and applies varying opacities to highlight different expression domains. The visualization refers to the study "Graphical perception of Multiple Time Series" by Javed et al., and supports exploration of data patterns via a detailed, segmented, interactive design.
