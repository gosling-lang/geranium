The visualization consists of a circular and a linear arrangement of genomic data on the hg19 assembly. The circular ideogram displays the genome in intervals, with rectangles indicating different categories. An interactive brush in blue links the circular and linear views. The circular view also includes tracks for 'Putative Driver' with black text, 'Gain' in sky blue rectangles, 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in dark orange rectangles, and a connection track with lines in various colors representing structural variants such as 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.' The linear tracks mirror these elements and include an ideogram, text annotations, a scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation' with colored points, and additional tracks for 'Insertion,' 'Deletion,' and 'Copy Number Variants' in gray rectangles. The visualization integrates multiple data types including CSV and VCF, providing layers of genomic insights.
