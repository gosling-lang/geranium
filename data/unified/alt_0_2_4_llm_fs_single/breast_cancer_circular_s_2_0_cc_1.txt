A circular visualization representing genomic data is displayed, showing the entire genome of hg38. The outer track features a genomic ideogram with colors reflecting different banding patterns. The next two tracks are circular charts with rectangles, indicating copy number variations in cancer data. One track uses purple rectangles for regions with zero minor copy number in tumors, while the other highlights regions with a total copy number above 4.5 in pink. The innermost track features connections illustrating structural variations such as tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions. Connections are color-coded, with stroke colors providing additional differentiation based on the type of structural variation.
