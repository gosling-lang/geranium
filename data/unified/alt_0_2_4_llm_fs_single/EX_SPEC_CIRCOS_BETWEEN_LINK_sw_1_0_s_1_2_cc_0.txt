A circular layout visualization titled "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements" organizes genomic data using stacked tracks. The first track is a circular bar chart displaying genomic intervals, with the height of green bars representing quantitative values from a multivec file. Two ideograms show chromosome sections with categories indicated by color-coded rectangles, based on their stains. A circular chart includes connections depicted in light gray and black, illustrating links between different genomic positions. The assembly used is hg38, arranged in parallel with linked genomic datasets maximizing space efficiency within a compact 1200x1200 px layout.
