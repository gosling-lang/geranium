A linear visualization titled "Example: Overlayed Tracks" features four overlaid line and scatter plots. The x-axis represents genomic positions from chromosome 1, ranging from 1 to 3,000,500. The y-axis shows expression values, where each line and corresponding points represent different samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The lines and points are colored distinctly for each sample, enhancing differentiation of categories. The size of points on the scatter plot is proportional to the expression values, providing an additional dimension of quantitative data.
