The visualization consists of two tracks in a linear layout focusing on chromosome 2. The top track is a line chart showing genomic data from samples 1, 3, and 4. Each sample is represented by different colored lines: blue, orange, and green, respectively. The x-axis displays the genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative values of peaks. The chart is stratified by sample categories.

The bottom track is an area chart for samples 1 and 2, using the same genomic focus. The areas are colored blue and orange. Both tracks share a linking ID that connects their genomic domains, ensuring that they correspond to the same regions on chromosome 2. The layout is horizontally oriented, utilizing white strokes and 0.5 stroke width for clear delineation. The overall assembly is based on hg38 with interactive zoom capabilities.
