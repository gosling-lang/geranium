Visualization title: **Basic Marks: Link**

This visualization is a linear layout emphasizing genomic connections or interactions within chromosome 1 (chr1). It features arcs colored in red that connect pairs of genomic regions, symbolizing interactions or links between these sections. The genomic positions are marked along the x-axis, illustrating intervals that help visualize the span of these interactions. This visualization leverages a CSV dataset that includes genomic fields such as start (s1, s2) and end (e1, e2) positions, allowing the arcs to map connections effectively across the chromosome. The title "Basic Marks: Link" and subtitled "Tutorial Examples" provide context, indicating its instructional purpose in exploring basic marks for genomic data representation. The specified stroke color for the arcs is a soft red (#fc8585), adding visual clarity and differentiation.
