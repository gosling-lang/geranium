The visualization titled "Example: Overlayed Tracks" is a linear chart featuring layered line and scatter plots. Displayed across chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500, it depicts expression values (peak) stratified by four samples. Each sample is represented by a distinct color: blue, orange, green, and red. The visualization uses both lines and points, where the point sizes are adjusted according to the expression values. The data is sourced from a multivec file, with the x-axis representing genomic positions and the y-axis showing quantitative expression values.
