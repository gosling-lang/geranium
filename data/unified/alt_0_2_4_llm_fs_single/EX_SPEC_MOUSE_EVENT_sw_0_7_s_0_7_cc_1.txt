A set of five visualizations in a linear layout highlights the customization of mouse interactions on various genomic tracks. The first three tracks are bar charts displaying genomic data across chromosome 1, differentiated by color based on categories: individual marks, grouped by sample, and by genomic position. Each track supports interactive hover and selection features. The fourth track presents gene annotations on chromosome 3 with interactive elements highlighting gene-specific data. The final track is an ideogram that groups marks by chromosome, providing a comprehensive overview of chromosomal regions with detailed styling for visual emphasis.
