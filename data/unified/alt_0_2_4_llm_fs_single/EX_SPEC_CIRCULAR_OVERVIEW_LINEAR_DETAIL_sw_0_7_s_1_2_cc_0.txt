The visualization consists of a circular layout and two linear bar charts arranged vertically. The circular section displays the entire genome with genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, stratified by categories shown in different colors. The connections between chromosomes are depicted with strokes indicating different types of genomic rearrangements, such as deletions and duplications, in pink. The linear charts, linked via interactive brushes to specific regions (chr5 and chr16), represent detailed genomic data for samples 1 to 4 using distinct colors for each sample. The visualization aids in comparative genomic analysis across multiple layers of data.
