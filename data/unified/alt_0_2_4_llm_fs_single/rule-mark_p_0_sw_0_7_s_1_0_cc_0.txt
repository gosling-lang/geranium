The visualization titled "Rule Mark" with the subtitle "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines" displays a linear layout. It overlays multiple tracks for comprehensive genomic data presentation. The first track is a bar chart showing genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, with bars colored in purple. The second track features a chart with horizontal and vertical green lines, where expression values are indicated by the stroke width on the y-axis. The third track consists of vertical sky blue lines, aligning with the genomic positions on the x-axis. The use of dashed styling in this visualization adds a distinct boundary to the chart elements.
