A circular visualization displays genomic data on chromosome 1 in two tracks: on the left, a circular bar chart shows genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values as bars on the y-axis, where four samples are represented in distinct colorsâ€”blue, orange, green, and red. On the right, a circular line chart and scatter plot depict the same genomic positions. The chart is stratified by rows for each sample, with lines and dots indicating expression levels. The size of the dots varies with expression values, adding an additional quantitative dimension. The visualization effectively uses color and shape to distinguish samples and data types.
