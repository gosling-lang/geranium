A linear scatter plot displays a genomic dataset using a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 using the hg38 assembly. The plot shows four samples stratified by rows, with each sample represented in a different color: blue for 'sample 1', orange for 'sample 2', green for 'sample 3', and red for 'sample 4'. The position of points along the x-axis is based on genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative peak values. The size and opacity of points are encoded by the peak values, and hovering over the points reveals a tooltip with details including start and end genomic positions, peak value, and sample name. The layout is vertical with a center radius of 0.8, providing a clear view of chromosomal expression data.
