The visualization consists of two circular scatter plots positioned horizontally. Both plots represent genomic data from chromosome 1 spanning from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The left chart displays scatter points where the size and position on the y-axis are determined by the 'peak' values in the dataset. The color of each point depicts different categories defined by the 'sample' field, including 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' The right chart stratifies these categories by rows, with each row representing a different sample. This organization provides a clear visual separation of the data by sample while retaining the color-coding scheme to indicate sample categories. The opacity of the points is set at 50%, allowing for visual overlap to be displayed. Both charts include interactive tooltips to reveal specific data values such as genomic start and end positions, 'peak' value, and sample category upon hovering over the data points.
