The visualization is a linear genomic range annotation track displaying chromosome 3 from positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. The chart is stratified into rows based on the strand orientation, with tracks overlaying each other. Three types of genomic features are shown: genes, exons, and introns. Genes and exons are represented with pink rectangles, while introns are represented with green rectangles. The track layout is horizontal with color and positional encoding providing a clear distinction among the different genomic elements. A stroke around the rectangles is gray, adding a subtle outline for visual emphasis.
