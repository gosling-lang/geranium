The visualization is a linear arrangement depicting genetic sequences along chromosome 1 from positions 3,000,000 to 3,000,010. It overlays bar and text elements to represent the sequence data from a multivec file. Each bar corresponds to a base (A, T, G, C), with the height indicating the count and colored according to the base type: adenine (blue), thymine (orange), guanine (green), and cytosine (red). The bases are also annotated with white text over the bars. The linear view emphasizes bold text styling for clarity and support of genomic data exploration.
