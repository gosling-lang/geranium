The heat map in a linear layout visualizes a matrix file, displaying interaction data across the genome assembly hg38. The genomic positions are represented on both the x- and y-axes without showing explicit axis lines. The color intensity encodes quantitative values, with a warm color range indicating varying levels of interaction. The visualization is titled 'HFFc6_Micro-C' and is designed with a size of 600x600 pixels.
