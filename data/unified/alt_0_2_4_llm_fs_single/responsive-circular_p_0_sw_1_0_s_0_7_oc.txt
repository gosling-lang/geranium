A circular bar chart visualizing genomic data from chromosome 12, spanning the interval 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. This chart structures data into multiple concentric rings, each representing different 'sample' categories, using various colors for distinction. The 'peak' values, derived from the multivec file, are represented radially by bars, with dynamic opacity and visibility based on track height conditions. Designed to responsively adapt between circular and linear layouts, the visualization showcases patterns of expression with gridlines for clarity, referencing the study by Javed et al. on graphical perception of multiple time series.
