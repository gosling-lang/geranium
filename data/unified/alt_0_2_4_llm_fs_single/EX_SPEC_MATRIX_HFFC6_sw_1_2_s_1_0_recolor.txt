The visualization is a horizontal arrangement of genomic data focusing on chromosome 7 of hg38, spanning from 77,700,000 to 81,000,000 base pairs. It includes two main views for comparison: Micro-C and Hi-C for HFFc6 cells. Each view contains a vertical and a horizontal section.

In the vertical section, there are stacked bar charts displaying data from HFFc6_H3K4me3, HFFc6_ATAC, and HFFC6_CTCF. These charts show genomic intervals on the x-axis with quantitative peak values, encoded in purple, dark green, and orange respectively. Additional genomic position annotation tracks use triangles to indicate strand orientation and are colored pink and green.

The horizontal section features large matrix plots titled "HFFc6_Micro-C" and "HFFc6_Hi-C," showing genomic interactions with color intensity representing expression values. A subsequent bar chart, "Epilogos (hg38)," displays various chromatin states with color coding for categories like "Active TSS" and "Enhancers."

The title "Matrix Visualization" and subtitle "Comparison of Micro-C and Hi-C for HFFc6 Cells" guide the analysis. The layout style includes a light gray background for clarity, and tracks are horizontally linked with minimal spacing to facilitate comparison.
