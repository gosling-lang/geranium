A heat map in a linear layout visualizes a matrix from hg38, displaying genomic regions between intervals 800,000,000 and 1,800,000,000. The x-axis and y-axis represent genomic positions, with intervals shown on both axes. The color intensity encodes quantitative expression values using a hot color scheme. The matrix data is sourced from the specified URL. The overall layout dimensions are 600x600, with adjustable zoom limits and horizontal orientation.
