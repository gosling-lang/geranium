The visualization consists of a circular and linear display organized vertically. The circular view depicts the entire genome, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. The circle contains an ideogram, a text annotation for 'Putative Driver', and two range tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)', displayed in blue and red. A line-connection track represents genomic connections, color-coded by 'svclass' categories such as 'Translocation' and 'Duplication'. The linear view mirrors the circular elements with added details: a gene annotation track, a scatter plot of 'Point Mutation' showcasing mutation distances, and a range track for 'Copy Number Variants', displayed in grey. The scatterplot differentiates mutation types by color, enhancing genomic insights through visual interactivity.
