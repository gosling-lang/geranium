A circular scatter plot visualizes a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. This plot uses point marks to represent genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. The data is stratified into rows representing different samples, excluding some filtered categories. Each row corresponds to a specific sample and is color-coded in a distinctive palette, including blue, orange, green, red, purple, and brown. The circular layout highlights the distribution of expression levels across the specified genomic interval, without an explicit y-axis. This visualization offers an intuitive representation of genomic data density and variation among the samples.
