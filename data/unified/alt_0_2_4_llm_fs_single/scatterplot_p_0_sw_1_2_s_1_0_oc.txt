A linear scatter plot visualizes a multivec file, representing the region of chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500. The data points are plotted with their positions on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis. Each point's size correlates with the magnitude of the peak. Different samples, labeled as 'sample 1' through 'sample 4', are distinguished by color, with a legend provided. Points are semi-transparent, allowing for overlapping data visualization. The track has a width of 720 pixels and a height of 130 pixels, with a detailed tooltip showing start and end positions, peak value, and sample name.
