The visualization displays a linear view of chromosome 1 using the hg38 assembly. It consists of five overlay tracks. The top track is an ideogram indicating chromosomal bands in varied colors, including blue, orange, green, purple, and brown, which represent different chromosomal stains. The next track is a gene annotation track where blue and orange triangles point right and left, indicating gene direction for positive and negative strands, respectively.

Following the annotation track are two chromosomal copy number variation (CNV) tracks. The first CNV track displays genomic regions in green rectangles where the minor copy number in tumor cells is zero. The second CNV track shows regions in sky blue rectangles where the total copy number in tumor cells is significantly increased, ranging from 4.5 to 900. 

The final track is a structural variant (SV) connection track that visualizes genomic rearrangements with connections. The SVs are categorized by color and stroke, with classes such as tandem duplication, translocation, deletion, and inversion, shown with varying colors like green and blue. The visualization is linked by a mid-scale interaction for exploring different genomic positions.
