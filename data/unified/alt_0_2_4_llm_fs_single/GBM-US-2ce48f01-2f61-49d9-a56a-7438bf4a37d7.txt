A visualization with a circular and linear layout, displaying genomic data from hg19. The circular view includes five tracks: an ideogram, point annotations for 'Putative Driver,' and two range annotations titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH).' Additionally, a connection track shows structural variations like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication' based on the 'svclass' field. This view covers multiple chromosomes with categorical coloring.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and features an ideogram, text for 'Putative Driver,' a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation,' and three range annotations. The scatter plot visualizes a VCF file, with points representing mutation distances and subtypes. Range annotations include 'Copy Number Variants,' 'Gain,' and 'LOH,' displayed with respective color codings. Interactive elements include brushing and linking between views for detailed exploration.
