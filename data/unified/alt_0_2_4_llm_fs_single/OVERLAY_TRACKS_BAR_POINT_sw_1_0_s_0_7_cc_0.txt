A linear bar and point chart visualizes genetic significance data, focusing on chromosome 3. It overlays bars and points representing different clinical significance categories like 'Pathogenic' and 'Benign.' Categories are color-coded, with bars featuring varying stroke colors and points sized and colored to reflect significance, from red for 'Pathogenic' to green for 'Benign.' The x-axis represents genomic intervals, while the y-axis displays categorical significance levels. This visualization highlights the distribution and impact of clinically significant genetic variations.
