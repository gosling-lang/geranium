A visualization with a vertical arrangement contains a circular view and two horizontal linear views. The circular view includes two tracks: a multivec file visualized as stacked bars stratified by rows representing four samples, colored differently, and a withinLink track illustrating genomic connections. Intervals on the x-axis display the genome, while expression values appear on the y-axis. The colors of the connections categorize them into deletions, inversions, translocations, and tandem duplications. Two brushes in the circular view link to the linear views.

The linear views present zoomed-in data for specific chromosomes. The first linear bar chart corresponds to chromosome 5, utilizing data from a multivec file with the same sample stratification as the circular view. The second linear bar chart displays chromosome 16 data, similarly color-coded by sample. Both linear charts represent genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression levels on the y-axis, retaining the categorical color scheme from the circular view.
