The visualization is a vertically arranged, linear layout bar chart depicting genomic data across chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. It displays four samples, each represented in separate rows and distinguished by different colors: blue for "sample 1," orange for "sample 2," green for "sample 3," and red for "sample 4." The x-axis shows genomic positions, while the y-axis represents the quantitative "peak" values. The chart uses a multivec data file, with a tooltip feature that provides additional information, including start and end genomic positions and peak values.
