A circular and a linear view are arranged vertically, linked by a blue interactive brush in the circular view. The circular view represents the entire genome, with the linear view focusing on chromosome 1. Circular tracks include an ideogram, point annotation, genomic range annotations titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' and a connection track. The point annotation track displays JSON values, while range annotations show genomic segments in blue and orange. Connections between genomic positions are colored by 'svclass' categories: 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.' The linear view, mirroring the circular layout, adds a gene annotation track, scatterplot, and additional range annotations. The scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation' visualizes VCF data, positioning points based on the distance to prior mutations and categorizing by 'SUBTYPE.' A range annotation track displays two rows, 'Insertion' and 'Deletion,' with yellow and green rectangles. Another track, 'Copy Number Variants,' visualizes quantitative 'total_cn' data with gray rectangles.
