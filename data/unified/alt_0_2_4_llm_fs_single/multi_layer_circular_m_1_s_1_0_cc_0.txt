A multi-line chart in a circular layout visualizes a multivec file, displaying chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The lines represent different samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 6', 'sample 7', 'sample 8'), each assigned a distinct color including blue, orange, green, red, purple, and brown. The visualization encodes genomic positions on the x-axis and expression peaks on the y-axis. The categories are organized into rows, enhancing comparative analysis across samples.
