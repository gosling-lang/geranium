The visualization comprises multiple tracks displaying genomic features of breast cancer variants, organized in both circular and linear layouts. The title "Breast Cancer Variant (Staaf et al. 2019)" and subtitle "Genetic characteristics of RAD51C- and PALB2-altered TNBCs" introduce the study's focus. 

The circular view features a comprehensive ideogram for patient PD35930a, highlighting different chromosomal regions with categories indicated by color. Tracks include "Patient Overview," visualized using rectangles, and "Putative Driver," presenting gene text annotations. "LOH" and "Gain" tracks depict genomic alterations using color-coded rectangles, while the "Structural Variant" track illustrates structural rearrangements with color-coded connections signifying 'tandem-duplication,' 'translocation,' 'deletion,' and 'inversion.'

The linear view provides a chromosome 1-wide perspective, zooming into detailed regions. Tracks show gene annotations with directional indicators, detailing gene orientations and locations. "LOH" and "Gain" are also highlighted with distinct color schemes. In addition to these, coverage and pileup data of sequence alignments are visualized, using BAM data, to reveal genomic read structures in bar and rectangle formats, respectively. This multilayered representation allows for a detailed exploration of genetic variances affecting breast cancer.
