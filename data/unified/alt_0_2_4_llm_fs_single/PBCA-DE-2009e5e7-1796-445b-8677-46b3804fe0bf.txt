A circular and linear genomic visualization displays the detailed analysis of chromosomal data using various tracks. The circular ideogram represents the entire genome with color-coded cytogenetic bands. It incorporates five distinct tracks: an annotation track labeled 'Putative Driver,' genomic range tracks 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' and a structural variant connections track showing interactions with different color codes based on variant categoriesâ€”'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.'

The linear view aligns with chromosome 1 and includes an ideogram, gene annotations, point mutations, and copy number variations. It features text annotations for 'Putative Driver,' point mutations colored by subtype, and range annotations for insertions and deletions. 'Copy Number Variants' are depicted with bars representing quantitative data. An interactive brush in the circular view allows seamless navigation between genome-wide and chromosome-specific data, linked by a blue highlighting brush.
