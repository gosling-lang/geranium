A circular scatter plot visualizes multivec data for chromosome 12, between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The data is structured in a circular layout with points representing genomic positions. The plot is stratified into rows, each corresponding to categories labeled 'sample 1' through 'sample 8', with the exception of omitted categories labeled as 'sample -'. Points are sized based on the 'peak' value and are color-coded to distinguish categories. The y-axis represents quantitative expression values, while color variations differentiate the sample categories. The layout is designed in a circular manner with a defined center radius, creating a visually distinct representation of genomic data.
