The visualization is a linear layout featuring five tracks, each presenting genomic data in different forms. The first track is an ideogram displaying segments of chromosome 1 with various color-coded bands representing different staining categories. It includes left and right triangles to denote specific genomic features. The second track is a genomic position annotation track, showing gene orientations with blue right-facing and orange left-facing triangles, stratified by strand. The third and fourth tracks utilize rectangle marks to depict regions of interest, with sky blue rectangles representing regions with minor copy number alterations in tumors and pink rectangles showing regions with total copy number gains in tumors, respectively. The final track shows genomic rearrangements with connecting lines, varying in color and stroke based on the type of structural variation, including 'tandem-duplication', 'translocation', 'deletion', and 'inversion'.
