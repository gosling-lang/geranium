**A circular chart titled "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements" visualizes genomic data. This chart includes four layers.**

1. **Circular Bar Chart Layer:** Displays genomic intervals along the circumference with a bar chart where the height of the bars represents quantitative data ('peak') for 'sample 1.' The bars are colored light gray.

2. **Two Circular Ideograms:** Depict chromosome bands (cytobands) using different colors to indicate categories such as 'gneg', 'gpos25', etc., providing a reference for genomic locations.

3. **Circular Chart with Connections:** Displays links between genomic positions, using light gray strokes for connections within one chromosome and black strokes for others.

By arranging these elements in a circular layout with parallel tracks, this visualization effectively combines structural genomic data with expression levels, allowing for comparative analysis across genomic regions.
