A circular visualization consists of a multivec line chart and an ideogram track, focusing on chromosome 1 of the hg38 genome. The circular layout uses a line chart to represent expression values, with different line colors for categories such as "sample 1" to "sample 4." Surrounding this, an ideogram displays genomic bands, with colors differentiating categories like "gneg" and "gpos." The layout accommodates interactive exploration, providing genomic insights through layered visualization.
