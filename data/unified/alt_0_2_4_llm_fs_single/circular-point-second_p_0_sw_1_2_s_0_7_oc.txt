A circular scatter plot visualizes genomic data from multiple samples, using a multivec file. The chart focuses on chromosome 1, displaying positions from 1 to 3,000,500. Points represent expression values, with size and opacity illustrating the magnitude of 'peak.' Colors represent four categories: 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4,' each depicted in distinct shades. The layout is circular, centered around a radius of 0.5, emphasizing the genomic distribution across a defined interval. A legend indicates categories, and tooltips provide genomic positions and values.
