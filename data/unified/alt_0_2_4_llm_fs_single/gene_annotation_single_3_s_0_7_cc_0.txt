The visualization is a linear view titled "HiGlass" representing genomic data from chromosome 3, between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. It uses data from a BEDDB file to display gene annotations. The chart is arranged horizontally with tracks visualizing genes as text and directional symbols. Blue indicates the forward strand genes and orange indicates the reverse strand genes. Genes are represented by right and left arrows for positive and negative strands, respectively, while exons are shown as rectangles. The plot effectively stratifies elements by strand, enhancing the clarity of gene orientation along this chromosomal region.
