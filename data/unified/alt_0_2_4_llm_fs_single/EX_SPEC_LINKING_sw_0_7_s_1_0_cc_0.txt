A visualization titled "Visual Linking" features a vertical arrangement with linked circular and linear bar charts. The circular chart displays genomic intervals on the x-axis with colored bars representing expression on the y-axis, categorized by sample and color. An interactive brush links the circular and linear views, allowing users to adjust position and range to update the detailed view below. The linear view consists of two bar charts, showing genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, again organized by sample and color. This setup provides an overview of genome-wide data and a focused detail view, facilitating comparative analysis across different genomic regions and samples.
