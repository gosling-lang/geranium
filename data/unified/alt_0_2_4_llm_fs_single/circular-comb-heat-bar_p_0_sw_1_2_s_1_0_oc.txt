The circular layout visualization consists of two charts representing genomic data for chromosome 1, spanning the interval from 1 to 3,000,500. The left chart is a circular heat map displaying genomic intervals along the x-axis, with color intensity encoding expression values. It is divided into rows by categories: 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' The right chart is a circular bar chart with genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, represented by bars. The chart is also stratified by categories, differentiated by the color of the bars. The data is derived from a multivec file, and each track is assembled using the 'hg38' assembly. The layout is static with a spacing arrangement.
