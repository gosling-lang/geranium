A vertically arranged linear bar chart visualizes genomic data across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500, representing four samples. The x-axis displays genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative 'peak' values. Each row is stratified by sample, shown in distinct colors: blue for 'sample 1', orange for 'sample 2', green for 'sample 3', and red for 'sample 4'. A legend clarifies these color categories. Tooltip information includes start and end genomic positions, peaks, and sample names.
