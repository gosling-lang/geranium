A circular scatter plot visualization with a vertical arrangement displays two tracks side by side, each representing genomic intervals between positions 1 and 3,000,500 on chromosome 1 (chr1). Each track visualizes multivec data with points whose size and position reflect quantitative values from a field named 'peak.' The first track stratifies points by four samples: 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4,' displayed with individual colors: yellow, teal, blue, and pink. The second track is also stratified similarly and adds supporting grid lines for the expression axis. Both plots use an opacity value of 0.5 and incorporate tooltips showing genomic start and end positions, value, and sample name. Point colors indicate sample categories, with legends provided.
