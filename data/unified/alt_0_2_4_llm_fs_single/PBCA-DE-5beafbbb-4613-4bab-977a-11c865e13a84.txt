The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view arranged vertically, linked by an interactive brush. The circular view, using data from a CSV file, displays a complete genome ideogram and several tracks including genomic variations represented by colored rectangles. It features tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' that display regions with structural variations. The colors differentiate types of variations, such as blue for 'Gain' and orange for 'LOH'.

In the circular view, connections between genomic positions are illustrated, with line colors indicating categories like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication'. The linear section highlights chromosome 1, showcasing gene annotations and point mutations. The 'Point Mutation' track, using a VCF file, employs a scatter plot where points' colors reveal mutation types, such as 'C>A' and 'C>T'.

Additional linear tracks include 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' as range annotations, with color-coding for differentiation. A 'Copy Number Variants' track marks genomic regions with quantitative data, employing a gray color scheme. The visualization leverages interactive elements and a cohesive color palette for an informative genomic analysis display.
