A circular and linear view visualization of hg19 genome data, arranged vertically. The circular view shows a full genome ideogram with tracks for "Putative Driver," "Gain," "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and structural variations (SVs) in different colors. Tracks display data in a radial format with genomic connections emphasizing categories like Translocation, Duplication, Deletion, and Inversion (TtT and HtH). An interactive brush links this view to the linear representation of chromosome 1.

In the linear view, detailed ideograms, gene tracks, and sequence variations are presented horizontally. Key tracks include "Putative Driver," a scatterplot of "Point Mutation," and several range annotations like "Copy Number Variants," presented with bars or points. Colors differentiate data categories such as 'C>A', 'C>G', 'C>T', etc., and relate them to genomic positions and distances. Structural variations in the linear tracks mirror those in the circular view, maintaining visual linkages.
