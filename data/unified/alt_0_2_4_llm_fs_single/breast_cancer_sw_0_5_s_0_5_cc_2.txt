Linear genome visualization with five overlay tracks linked by a mid-scale scale. The top track is an ideogram, representing chromosome 1 with bands and colored rectangles. The second track showcases gene annotations with blue right-pointing triangles for positive strands and orange left-pointing triangles for negative strands. The third track visualizes copy number variation with sky blue rectangles representing regions of minor copy number zero. The fourth track shows total copy number variations in green rectangles. The bottom track features structural variants with curved links representing different variations like "tandem-duplication," "translocation," "deletion," and "inversion." Colors and strokes of the curves are distinct for each variant type.
