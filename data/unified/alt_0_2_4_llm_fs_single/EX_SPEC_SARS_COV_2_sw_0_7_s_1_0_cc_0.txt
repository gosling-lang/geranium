A linear visualization of SARS-CoV-2 genome features multiple interconnected views. The first view, titled "NC_045512.2 Genes," displays genomic intervals using sky blue rectangles with pink triangle markers indicating direction and sky blue text for gene symbols. The second view, "S Protein Annotation," highlights regions such as receptor-binding domains and cleavage sites, each colored distinctly in rows. Another view, "NC_045512.2 Sequence," presents a multivec bar chart representing nucleotide distribution across the genome, with specific bases annotated in white text. The final view, "TRS-L-Dependent Recombination Events," uses an arching blue connection pattern to denote linked genomic positions, reflecting recombination events. The layout is structured for interactive exploration, facilitating detailed genomic analysis.
