The visualization exhibits a dual-chart layout in a circular format, focusing on chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The left track combines a line chart and scatter plot, with genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Points are sized and colored to represent expression levels and sample categories. The right track features a circular bar chart, with bar heights indicating expression levels across samples. Categories such as 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4' are distinguished by different colors.
