The visualization is a linear layout of genomic arcs titled "Visual Encoding," with a subtitle "Arcs." It depicts connections within chromosome 1, specifically between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. The arcs, representing genomic links, are presented in a variety of colors, each color signifying a different category. The data is sourced from a CSV file and the arcs are drawn from fields labeled "s1" and "e1" to "s2" and "e2." The arcs are colored using a nominal field "s1," with opacity set to 0.2, and are outlined in black with a stroke width of 0.5. The total width of the visualization is 864 units and height is 186 units.
