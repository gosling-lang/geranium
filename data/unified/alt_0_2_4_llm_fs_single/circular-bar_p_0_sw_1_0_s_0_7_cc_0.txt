A circular bar chart visualizing genomic data from a multivec file is structured with a vertical arrangement and static layout. The chart focuses on chromosome 1, covering positions from 1 to 3,000,500. Two categories, 'sample 1' and 'sample 2', are represented in distinct colors: blue and orange. The bars extend from the minimum to the maximum peak value, with the genomic position on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Each bar's edges are slightly outlined in black with a stroke width of 0.2. Legend visibility is enabled to facilitate easy identification of the data categories.
