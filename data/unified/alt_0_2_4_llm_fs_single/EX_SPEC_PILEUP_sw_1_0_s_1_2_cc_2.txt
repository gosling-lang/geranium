The visualization presents coverage and pileup tracks in a linear layout using BAM data to depict sequence alignment on chromosome 1, specifically between positions 136,750 and 139,450. The top track is a coverage bar chart, where the height of the bars represents the number of reads aligned in respective genomic intervals, colored in silver. The bottom track displays a pileup of individual reads, presented as rectangles and stratified into rows based on categorical structural variations. These categories are indicated by colors: 'normal read' (grey), 'deletion (+-)' (orange), 'inversion (++/--)' (blue), 'duplication (-+)' (purple), 'more than two mates' (brown), 'mates not found within chromosome' (red), and 'clipping' (black). The overall visualization is titled "Pileup Track Using BAM Data" and effectively highlights the variety of structural variations within the specified genomic region.
