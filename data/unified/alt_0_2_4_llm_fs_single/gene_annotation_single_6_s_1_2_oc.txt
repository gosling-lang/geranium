A linear genomic range annotation track titled "Cyverse-QUBES" visualizes chromosomal positions on chromosome 3, ranging from 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. The chart displays genomic annotations using text labels for genes in black. It includes gray right and left triangles indicating the direction of gene strands and light gray rectangles representing gene bodies. Purple rectangles with strokes show exons. The data is arranged horizontally and stratified by the strand ("+" or "-"). The chart spans a width of 350 pixels and a height of 130 pixels, utilizing a BEDDB data source.
