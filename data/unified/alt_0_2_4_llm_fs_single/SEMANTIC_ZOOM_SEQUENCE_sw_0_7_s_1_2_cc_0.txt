The visualization titled "Example: Semantic Zooming" features a linear bar chart that represents genomic data, showcasing the distribution of base pairs across different chromosomes. The x-axis is divided into chromosomes from chr1 to chr22, with each bar displaying the frequency of four nucleotide basesâ€”A, T, G, and C. Each base is color-coded: blue for C, orange for T, green for G, and red for A. The stacked bar chart indicates the count of each base type at various genomic positions. When zoomed in, text marks that specify base pairs become visible. The chart is interactive, allowing detailed observation of genomic sequences when zoomed into specific regions. The subtitle clarifies the interactivity feature, emphasizing the appearance of base pair text marks at higher zoom levels.
