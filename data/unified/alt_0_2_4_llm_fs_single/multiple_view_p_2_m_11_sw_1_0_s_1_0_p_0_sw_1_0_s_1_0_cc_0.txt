A visualization titled "Visual Linking" displays a vertical arrangement with interactive brushing. The top view contains linear and circular charts. The linear chart shows genomic intervals of chromosome 1 with expression levels as areas, stratified into categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4', colored in blue, orange, green, and red. An interactive brush updates a detailed view below. The circular chart represents the same data as concentric lines with similar color encoding and linking functionality. The bottom view presents a linear scatter plot focused on chromosome 1 between positions 160,000,000 and 200,000,000. Points reflect peak values by category, using the same color scheme. This dynamic setup allows exploration of genomic data with visual linkage and interactive refinement.
