The visualization contains multiple tracks in a linear layout, exploring various genomic data. The top track showcases transcripts on chromosome 3, with arrows indicating gene direction and annotations up to 15 rows, colored in blue and orange, depicting positive and negative strands, respectively. Below, a track titled "Likely Benign" focuses on chromosome 2, displaying sequences with colored points representing different genetic categories, such as A, T, G, and C. Text annotations and arrows indicate significant variants. A connection track uses lines to link genomic locations, color-coded in pink to highlight specific interactions. The bottom segment on chromosome 17 is a scatter plot of pathogenic variants. Points are colored according to significance categories like "Pathogenic" or "Likely Benign." Displacement and opacity adjustments optimize visual clarity, ensuring a clear presentation of overlapping marks.
