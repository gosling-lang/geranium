A circular bar chart visually represents genomic data using a vector file, displaying the full genome of hg38. The positions in the genome are plotted around the circle on the x-axis, with their corresponding peak values illustrated as purple bars on the y-axis. The circular layout allows for a compact overview of genomic distributions, providing insights into expression values across different genome positions.
