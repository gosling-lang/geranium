A linear scatter plot visualizes a multivec file across chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500 in the hg38 assembly. The data points are organized into four rows, corresponding to 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is represented by points of distinct colors, and the position on the x-axis indicates genomic coordinates. The y-axis displays 'peak' values, and the size of each point reflects these values quantitatively. The chart's opacity is set to 0.5, and interactive tooltips provide additional data details, such as start and end genomic positions and sample information.
