The visualization titled "Visual Linking" showcases a multivec dataset of chromosome 1 in a vertical arrangement, featuring one circular and two linear bar charts. The circular chart displays genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, stratified by four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each represented by different colors. An interactive brush on the x-axis links to the linear charts, which are horizontally arranged, highlighting genomic intervals and expression in more detail. The upper linear chart provides an overview while the lower, detail view focuses on a specific interval between 160,000,000 and 200,000,000 base pairs, updating dynamically based on the brush's position. The design illustrates interactive data exploration across hierarchical genomic data.
