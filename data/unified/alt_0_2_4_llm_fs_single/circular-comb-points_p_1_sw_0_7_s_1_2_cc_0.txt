A circular multivec visualization showcasing genomic positions along chromosome 1, from base 1 to 3,000,500, in two circular scatter plots. Each plot features data points indicating peaks derived from a multivec file, stratified by categories labeled 'sample 1' through 'sample 4.' The first plot displays expression values on a y-axis with size encoding, while the second plot arranges points by category within rows. Points are colored in a palette of blue, orange, green, and red, with an opacity of 0.5, aiding category distinction. Tooltips enlarge on genomic position, peak value, and sample category, enriching the user interaction experience.
