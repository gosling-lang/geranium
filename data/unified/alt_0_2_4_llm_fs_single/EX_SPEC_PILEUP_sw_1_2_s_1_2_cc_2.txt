A visualization in a linear layout displays sequence alignment using a BAM file, focusing on chromosome 1 between positions 136,750 and 139,450. The top track is a coverage plot represented by a bar chart, where bar heights indicate the number of reads aligned to specific genomic regions, colored in sky blue. The bottom track is a pileup track showing individual reads as rectangles. These rectangles are color-coded based on the type of structural variation, including categories like 'normal read,' 'deletion (+-),' 'inversion (++)', 'inversion (--)', 'duplication (-+)', 'more than two mates', 'mates not found within chromosome', and 'clipping.' The title of the visualization is 'Pileup Track Using BAM Data.'
