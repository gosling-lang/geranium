A linear visualization in vertical arrangement features genomic data for chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The upper track combines a line chart and a scatter plot, displaying four samples. Points and lines illustrate quantitative data based on the 'peak' value, helped by size encoding for point height. Rows and colors differ by sample category. The lower track presents a bar chart, stratifying bars by 'sample' for categorical coloring, with expression shown on the y-axis against genomic positions. The dataset originates from a multivec format hosted at a specified URL.
