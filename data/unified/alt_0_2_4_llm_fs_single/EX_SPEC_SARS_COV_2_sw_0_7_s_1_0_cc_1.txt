A SARS-CoV-2 genomic visualization in a linear layout highlights data from the WashU Virus Genome Browser, NCBI, and GISAID. The first track, titled "NC_045512.2 Genes," displays genes as sky blue rectangles with pink lines indicating genome intervals, accompanied by gene symbols in matching sky blue lettering and an interactive green brush feature for detailed exploration. The "S Protein Annotation" track stratifies annotations by protein domains, with rectangles colored distinctively for categories such as "receptor-binding domain" and "heptad repeats." The "NC_045512.2 Sequence" section utilizes a bar chart to represent nucleotide frequency across bases A, T, G, and C, with text annotations in white for clarity. Finally, the "TRS-L-Dependent Recombination Events" chart uses light blue lines to depict genomic connections, illustrating recombination across specific genomic locations. The visual comprehensively covers annotations, sequences, and potential genomic restructuring events within the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
