The chart is a bubble plot using a linear layout to represent a multivec file, covering the entire genome of hg38. The genomic position is plotted on the x-axis, while the y-axis encodes quantitative data under the field "peak." The size of each point also reflects this field, offering a second layer of quantitative measurement. Points have a consistent sky blue color. The visualization is titled "Basic Marks: point" with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples."
