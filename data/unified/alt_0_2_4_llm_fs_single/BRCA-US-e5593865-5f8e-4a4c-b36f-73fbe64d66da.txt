The visualization comprises a circular view and a linear view arranged vertically, linked by an interactive brush. The circular view presents the entire genome (hg19), and the linear view highlights the region of chromosome 1. The circular view includes an ideogram and several tracks: a point annotation track visualizing genomic positions using text, two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" (blue rectangles) and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" (orange rectangles), and a line-connection track displaying links in different colors based on structural variations ('svclass'). These variations include 'Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', 'Inversion (TtT)', and 'Inversion (HtH)'.

In the linear view, nine tracks parallel those in the circular view, but with additional features: a scatterplot indicating point mutations with colors representing mutation subtypes, a gene annotation track displaying the genomic layout with directional triangles, and vertical lines linking positions within the genome. It further includes range annotation tracks for "Insertion" and "Deletion" in separate rows, as well as a track titled "Copy Number Variants" showing quantitative data. Each chart is detailed with legends, enabling easy identification of different genomic features and variations.
