The visualization comprises a circular view and a linear view, both displaying genomic data from the hg19 assembly. The circular view includes tracks for an ideogram, putative driver annotations, gain and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) regions, and structural variants. The ideogram, highlighted by a blue interactive brush, links to the linear view. The tracks represent different categories using color: light gray for certain regions, sky blue for "Gain," and dark orange for "LOH." Structural variant connections are shown with lines of various colors indicating classes like "Translocation," "Duplication," "Deletion," "Inversion (TtT)," and "Inversion (HtH)."

The linear view presents chromosome 1, featuring an ideogram with triangle markers, annotations for putative driver genes using black text, point mutations as colored scatter points, and genomic ranges for insertions, deletions, and copy number variants (CNV). The CNV track is marked by shades of gray bars, while colors in the scatter plot indicate mutation subtypes such as "C>A," "C>G," "C>T," "T>A," "T>C," and "T>G." The view also includes rule lines separating genomic sections, providing a clear demarcation of data categories. Both views employ color and opacity to differentiate tracks and enhance interpretability.
