The visualization presents a comprehensive depiction of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in a linear layout. Titled "SARS-CoV-2" with a subtitle indicating data sources including WashU Virus Genome Browser, NCBI, and GISAID, it encompasses multiple tracks.

The first track, "NC_045512.2 Genes," displays the genome with gene locations marked as pink rectangles, and features interactive elements like a blue brush for navigation and green triangle-shaped lines to indicate directionality. Text displaying gene symbols is highlighted in purple.

Below is the "S Protein Annotation" track, categorically displaying protein domains as separate rows colored differently for each protein type, such as the receptor-binding domain and heptad repeats. Text annotations are provided in black.

Another track, labeled "NC_045512.2 Sequence," visualizes the nucleotide composition across the genome, represented by colored bars in navy blue, orange, green, and red for bases A, T, G, and C, respectively. White text denotes base details, enriching the data presentation.

The "TRS-L-Dependent Recombination Events" track illustrates connections indicating recombination points across the genome using blue arcs.

Overall, this visualization expertly integrates data on the SARS-CoV-2 genome, employing varied graphical elements to elucidate gene locations, protein annotations, sequence composition, and recombination events.
