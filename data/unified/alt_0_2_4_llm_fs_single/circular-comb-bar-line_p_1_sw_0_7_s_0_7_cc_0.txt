The visualization is a circular chart illustrating genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from base 1 to 3,000,500. It features two primary tracks. The first track is an overlay with line and point marks, visualizing expression values along the genomic x-axis. The lines are stratified by four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each represented by distinct colors (blue, orange, green, and red). Points within this track vary in size based on the 'peak' values. The second track displays a bar chart, also stratified by the same four sample categories, with bars colored accordingly to show expression on the y-axis. The visualization utilizes a multivec data source, with color and size dynamically representing different data dimensions. The alignment and arrangement of the tracks provide a comprehensive circular genomic view, emphasizing variations across the specific genomic interval.
