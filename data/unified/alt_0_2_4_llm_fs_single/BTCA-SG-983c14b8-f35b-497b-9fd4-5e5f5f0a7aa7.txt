This complex visualization consists of two main views: a circular and a linear view, linked by an interactive brush in the circular section. The circular view presents an ideogram of the entire genome from the hg19 assembly. Key tracks include a genomic range annotation for 'Gain' (sky blue rectangles) and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' (dark orange rectangles), along with connections depicting different structural variants such as translocations and inversions in various colors.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, detailing several tracks: a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' visualizes VCF data with points representing mutation subtypes (e.g., C>A, C>G) in different colors; a gene annotation track displays genomic features like exons and genes, color-coded by strand orientation with accompanying labels; additional range annotation tracks show insertions and deletions in distinct colors, while the 'Copy Number Variants' track uses gray bars to represent copy number changes.

Each view provides detailed genomic insights, facilitating interactive exploration through coordinated brushing and linking between the circular and linear components, enhancing data interpretation.
