A vertically arranged visualization consists of three linked views. The top view is a scatter plot depicting genomic data from chromosome 1 (positions 160,000,000 to 200,000,000) with points colored by sample category. The middle view displays a circular line chart representing the entire chromosome 1, with the x-axis linked interactively to the scatter plot through a brush. The bottom view is a linear area chart, segmented by sample categories and also connected via a brush to the circular view. The title is "Visual Linking," emphasizing the interactive synchronization between views, enabling detailed examination of genomic data from an overview to specific details. The data uses a multivec format from hg38 assembly.
