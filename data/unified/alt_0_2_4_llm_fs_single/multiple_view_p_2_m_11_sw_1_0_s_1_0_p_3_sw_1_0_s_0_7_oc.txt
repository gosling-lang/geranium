The visualization titled "Visual Linking" showcases a multivec dataset across three charts in a vertical arrangement. The top chart is a linear scatter plot displaying genomic positions on chromosome 1 between 160,000,000 and 200,000,000. Each row represents a sample, with points colored by sample category. Below, the visualization includes a circular line chart and a linear area chart. Both charts depict genomic positions with lines and areas, stratified by sample categories. The circular chart includes a brush tool for zooming into specific regions, which updates the detail view in the linear plot, facilitating interactive exploration.
