The visualization consists of two tracks in a linear layout, showcasing genomic data from chromosome 2. The top track is a line chart, displaying expression levels for categories 'sample 1', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each category is differentiated by color and plotted along the x-axis representing genomic positions. The bottom track features an area chart, capturing expression for 'sample 1' and 'sample 2'. Both tracks are aligned with a common x-axis domain from chromosome 2, providing a comparative view of genomic variations. The visualization is interactive, with linked tracks sharing a common genomic domain.
