The visualization, titled "Hi-C Matrix," is a linear layout representing Hi-C data with overlaid tracks, showcasing the genome from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 base pairs. It uses a matrix as the primary visualization, where the genome is represented on both x-and y-axes, with color intensity indicating quantitative values. Overlaid are vertical and horizontal lines showing genomic positions, colored in green and pink, respectively. Additional tracks include bars and points, with the stroke color of bars indicating categories, while the points are purple, with size encoding quantitative data. The visualization is designed with dashed borders and includes annotations for genomic intervals. The dataset is accessed from a matrix file at a specified URL, with annotations and additional data pulled from JSON files.
