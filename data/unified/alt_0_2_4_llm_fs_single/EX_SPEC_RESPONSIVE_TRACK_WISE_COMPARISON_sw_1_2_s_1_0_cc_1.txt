A vertically arranged visualization with two sets of genomic tracks showing data from chromosome 12 and chromosome 8. The data includes genomic range annotations and bar charts. 

In the chromosome 12 view, annotations are drawn using pink triangles, rectangles, and text to represent genes, while bar charts for three samples are shown in sky blue, depicting expression peaks. 

For chromosome 8, similar bar charts are displayed with green, pink, and sky blue colors for expression peaks, along with genomic range annotations using triangles and rectangles in sky blue. 

Each bar chart corresponds to a specific sample, labeled as "Sample 1", "Sample 2", and "Sample 3", with genomic positions marked on the x-axis. The layout is designed for interactive responsiveness with linked genomic domains and an emphasis on visual clarity through distinct color codings and alignments.
