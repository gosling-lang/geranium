A circular and a linear view are arranged vertically, linked by an interactive brush highlighted in blue. The circular view visualizes the entire genome with five tracks, including an ideogram, a text annotation track titled 'Putative Driver,' and three range annotation tracks, 'Gain,' 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' and a connections track showing structural variations. The tracks display categories with different colors: light gray rectangles for overall genomic features, sky blue for gains, dark orange for LOH, and various colors for other structural variations.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, mirroring the circular view but with additional details. It includes a gene annotation track, a scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation,' which depicts mutations with different colors based on subtype, and tracks for insertions (green rectangles) and deletions (orange rectangles).

Both views are interactive, allowing users to explore genomic data with a consistent color scheme for categories in structural variations like translocations, duplications, and inversions, enhancing the visual connection between these comprehensive datasets.
