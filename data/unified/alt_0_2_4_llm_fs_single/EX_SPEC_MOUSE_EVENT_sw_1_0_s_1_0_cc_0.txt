The visualization is titled "Custom Mouse Events" with the subtitle "Customize mouse hovering and range selection events." It consists of several tracks in a linear layout, demonstrating interactive features such as mouse hovering and range selection. The first three tracks are bar charts titled "Individual Marks," "Group Marks By Sample," and "Group Marks By Genomic Position." These charts depict genomic data across chromosome 1, represented by colored bars indicating different samples or positions. The fourth track, "Group Marks By Gene," shows a genomic range annotation with gene labels on chromosome 3, featuring arrows indicating gene orientation. The last track, "Group Marks By Chromosome," displays an ideogram with chromosome bands, highlighting cytogenetic features with text, rectangles, and triangles. Mouse interactions include options to hover for details, select genomic ranges, and group marks by various attributes such as sample and position. The styling emphasizes different interactive states using colors like blue, red, and purple for hovering and selection effects.
