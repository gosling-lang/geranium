A visualization comprising a circular and linear arrangement linked by an interactive brush. The circular view presents a genomic ideogram of the entire hg19 assembly, with additional tracks highlighting genomic annotations. These include 'Putative Driver,' 'Gain,' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' indicated by blue and orange rectangles.

The linear arrangement focuses on chromosome 1, offering in-depth insights. Tracks include gene annotation, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation,' and range annotations for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion.' The scatter plot displays points indicating mutations, colored according to 'SUBTYPE.' Vertical connections depict structural variations such as 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' and 'Inversions,' color-coded by category. The 'Copy Number Variants' track is shown as gray bars, representing variation in copy number.
