The visualization is a bubble chart in a linear format, displaying a multivec dataset of the hg38 genome assembly. The 'position' of each point is plotted on the x-axis as genomic data, while the 'peak' value is represented both on the y-axis as quantitative data and by the size of each point. The data comprises one category, 'sample 1,' and the points are colored in green. The visualization is titled 'Basic Marks: point,' with the subtitle 'Tutorial Examples,' and spans a width of 960 pixels.
