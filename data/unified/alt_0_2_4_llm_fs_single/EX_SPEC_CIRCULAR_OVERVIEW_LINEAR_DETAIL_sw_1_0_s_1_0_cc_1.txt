The visualization consists of a circular layout stacked with two tracks, and a horizontal arrangement of two linear bar charts. The main circular track shows genomic data across various chromosomes, visualizing 'sample 1' to 'sample 4' with distinct color-coded bars. The expression levels are depicted on the y-axis, with data stratified by rows for each sample. An overlay of blue connections signifies genomic rearrangement links between specific chromosome regions, with stroke colors indicating different categories like 'deletion,' 'inversion,' 'translocation,' and 'tandem-duplication.'

In the horizontal section, two linked bar charts focus on chromosomes 5 and 16, detailing specific genomic intervals. These charts reflect the expression data for the same four samples using consistent color codes, highlighting details identified through interactive brushing on the circular chart. The layout, using a multivec dataset, presents a comprehensive view of genomic relationships and expression patterns using an integrated visual approach.
