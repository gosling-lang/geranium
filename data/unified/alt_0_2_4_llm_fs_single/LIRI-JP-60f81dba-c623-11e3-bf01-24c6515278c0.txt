A genomic visualization featuring a circular and a linear view linked by an interactive brush in the circular layout. The circular view includes five tracks: an ideogram, a point annotation track, two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and a line-connection track. These tracks display chromosome-wide data with distinctions in color indicating categories such as 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.' The linear view, focused on chromosome 1, contains nine tracks mirroring the circular view with additional gene annotation, scatterplot, and range annotation tracks. The scatterplot titled "Point Mutation" shows variant calls with colors indicating mutation subtypes, while the range annotation track "Copy Number Variants" presents variations in gray bars. Both views utilize a genomic assembly of hg19, facilitating detailed exploration of genomic alterations.
