The visualization is a circular layout showcasing genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. It includes a multivec dataset with four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is represented by a distinct line and point plot, with positions plotted on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis. The plot is stratified by rows representing the samples, with colors indicating different categories. The visualization emphasizes both line and point marks, with point sizes encoded by 'peak' values. The layout is static with a center radius of 0.5, offering detailed expression insights into genomic data distribution.
