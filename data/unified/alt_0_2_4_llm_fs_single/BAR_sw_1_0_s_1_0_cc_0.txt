The visualization presents a bar chart in a linear layout, illustrating a multivec file. The chart displays genomic intervals across the entire genome of hg38. The height of each bar represents data from the 'peak' field, with bars displayed in pink. The title is 'Basic Marks: bar', and the subtitle is 'Tutorial Examples'. The x-axis shows genome positions, while the y-axis represents expression values.
