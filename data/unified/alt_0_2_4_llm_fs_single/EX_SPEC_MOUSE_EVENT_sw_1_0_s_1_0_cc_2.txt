The visualization titled "Custom Mouse Events" displays customizable mouse interactions and range selection across five charts in a linear layout. The first three charts are bar charts labeled "Individual Marks," "Group Marks By Sample," and "Group Marks By Genomic Position," each showcasing genomic data on the x-axis and expression levels on the y-axis using bars colored by sample categories. The fourth chart, "Group Marks By Gene," is a genomic range annotation track displaying text labels of gene names along chromosome 3. The final chart, "Group Marks By Chromosome," is an ideogram depicting different chromosomal bands with text, rectangles, and triangle markers based on staining density. Mouse events such as hovering and range selection allow interactive engagement, with customized styles like color changes on interaction.
