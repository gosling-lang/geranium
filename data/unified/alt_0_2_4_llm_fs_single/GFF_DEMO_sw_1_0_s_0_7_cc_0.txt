The visualization is a linear layout of the E. coli genome from a GFF3 file, focusing on the region between positions 222,000 and 240,000 on chromosome U00096.3. It showcases genes color-coded by type, such as protein-coding, tRNA, rRNA, and others. Gene positions and directions are indicated with right and left triangles, while names are denoted as text on the chart. The layout employs smooth path styling and stratifies by strand. The visualization is titled "GFF3 file," with a subtitle "E. coli genome, colored by gene type."
