A circular and a linear view are vertically arranged and interconnected through a blue interactive brush. The circular view encapsulates the entire genome, while the linear segment zooms in on chromosome 1. The circular view comprises five tracks: an ideogram, a point annotation, two range annotations, and a line-connection track. The ideogram offers a brush tool to link with the linear view. The point annotation track presents text data from a JSON source, with 'Putative Driver' genes highlighted. The first range annotation, labeled 'Gain,' features blue rectangles, while 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' is represented by orange rectangles. Structural variants are depicted in the line-connection track, with lines differentiated by the 'svclass' data field, encompassing categories like 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.'

In the linear view, nine tracks are utilized, mirroring the circular view but with added granularity. A scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation' visualizes VCF data, illustrating distances to preceding mutations with points in diverse colors based on the 'SUBTYPE' field. Additional tracks display genomic information such as gene annotations, as well as 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' visualized as colored rectangles based on VCF data. 'Copy Number Variants' bars reflect quantitative information, maintaining a grayscale palette. This comprehensive visualization effectively synthesizes genomic data across multiple dimensions and categories, providing a robust analytical tool
