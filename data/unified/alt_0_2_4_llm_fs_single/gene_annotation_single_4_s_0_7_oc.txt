The visualization is a linear genomic annotation track titled "GmGDV." It displays gene annotations on chromosome 3, between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The view arranges tracks vertically, showing gene names and directions. Gene annotations are distinguished based on strand orientation: positive strands are represented in blue with rightward arrows, while negative strands are shown in red with leftward arrows. Exons are indicated using rectangles, and connecting lines represent genes' start and end. The visualization leverages colors and geometric shapes to present genomic features, facilitating the distinction between different strands.
