The visualization titled "Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts," with the subtitle "Gosling provides diverse visual encoding methods in circular layouts," presents multiple genomic data representations in circular configurations. The entire layout is static and focuses on chromosome 1, covering an interval from 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. The circular arrangement features several distinct tracks, each utilizing a different visual encoding method.

1. **Circular Link Chart**: This section includes connection links colored by genomic start positions. It depicts interactions within a genomic interval (103,900,000 to 104,100,000), illustrating associations across regions using translucent overlays, with connections indicated in various colors, providing visual distinction among categories.

2. **Circular Area Charts**: Multiple area charts are arranged horizontally, visually encoding expression levels across samples. The samples ('sample 1' to 'sample 4') are color-coded, clearly delineating each category's contribution to the overall genomic expression landscape.

3. **Circular Bar and Line Charts**: These include one circular bar chart and one circular combined line and scatter plot chart. Both depict the same genomic interval but utilize bars for one and lines combined with points for the other, encoding expression peaks.

4. **Circular Scatter and Point Charts**: Multiple scatter plots show expression values with points scaled by size, color-coded to distinguish among samples.

5. **Circular Heat Map**: It encodes
