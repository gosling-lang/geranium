The visualization presents a series of linear genomic tracks aligned horizontally. The top track is an ideogram of chromosome 1, using distinct colors to differentiate various staining regions. Below it, a genomic annotation track depicts gene positions with directional triangles indicating gene orientation, colored blue for positive and orange for negative strands. The third and fourth tracks illustrate genomic regions with rectangles: purple rectangles indicate segments with zero minor copy number in tumors, while blue rectangles display regions with amplified total copy number in tumors. The bottom track shows connections representing genomic rearrangements. Lines connect genomic positions, color-coded based on the structural variant class, such as tandem duplications or translocations.
