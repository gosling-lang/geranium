The visualization consists of two vertically arranged tracks in a linear layout, displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a heat map that represents genomic intervals on the x-axis and categorizes samples into four rows, with expression values encoded through color intensity. The bottom track is a bar chart illustrating the same genomic intervals, with expression values on the y-axis and sample categories distinguished by colored bars. Both tracks leverage data from a multivec file, utilizing fields such as 'start', 'end', 'position', and 'peak.' The layout is designed to facilitate genomic comparisons across samples, with interactive elements like tooltips providing detailed information for each genomic position and sample.
