The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view arranged vertically. The circular view encompasses the entire genome and features five tracks: a circular ideogram, a text track titled "Putative Driver," two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and a connection track linking genomic positions. The ideogram uses color to denote different categories, and an interactive brush aligns the circular view with the linear view.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and includes multiple tracks: a linear ideogram with triangles for centromeric regions, a text track titled "Putative Driver," gene annotation with exon details, a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" visualizing mutation types from a VCF file, range tracks for "Insertion" and "Deletion," and a bar chart for "Copy Number Variants" using CSV data.

The connection tracks in both views illustrate structural variations such as "Translocation," "Duplication," "Deletion," and various types of "Inversion," represented by differently colored and styled lines.
