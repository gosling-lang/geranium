A linear track displays a genome annotation using a BEDDB file on chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The track, titled "IGV," shows gene names and their genomic positions horizontally, with text annotations in purple. Genes are represented as rectangles, and directionality is indicated by white triangular patterns within the rectangles, pointing left and right to denote strand orientation. The track is divided into two rows based on strand, providing a clear visual separation.
