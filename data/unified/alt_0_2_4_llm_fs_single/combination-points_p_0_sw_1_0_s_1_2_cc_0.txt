A linear layout visualization containing two stacked scatter plots represents a multivec file for chromosome 1, covering positions from 1 to 3,000,500. Each track displays data points whose sizes and y-positions are determined by the 'peak' value. The points are color-coded by sample categories: blue for 'sample 1', orange for 'sample 2', green for 'sample 3', and red for 'sample 4'. Both plots use transparency for overlap visibility, set at an opacity value of 0.5. The top track stratifies samples into separate rows, while the bottom track integrates these into a single view, showing grid lines for quantitative guidance. The top track provides a concise overview, while the bottom track offers detailed insights into overlapping data across all samples.
