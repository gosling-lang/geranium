The linear bar chart titled "Example: Semantic Zooming" illustrates genomic data spanning multiple chromosomes. It visualizes the frequency of four nucleotide bases (A, T, G, C) along the genome. Each base is represented by distinct colors: pink for A, orange for C, blue for G, and green for T. The chart employs semantic zooming, meaning text labels appear when zooming into specific genomic intervals. Base counts are plotted on the y-axis with bars, while the genomic position is depicted on the x-axis. As the chart is zoomed in, additional text appears indicating specific base pairs, enhancing data exploration.
