A bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, displaying the genome of hg38 with data binned by intervals of five. The bars are colored pink, representing the peaks of genomic data across different chromosomes shown on the x-axis. The height of the bars reflects the quantitative values of peaks on the y-axis. The title of the chart is 'Basic Marks: bar,' with a subtitle 'Tutorial Examples'.
