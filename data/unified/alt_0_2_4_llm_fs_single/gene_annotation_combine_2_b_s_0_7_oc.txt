The visualization presents two genomic range annotation tracks in a linear layout, focusing on chromosome 3 from 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. The left track, titled 'IGV,' shows gene annotations with navy text and rectangles, while the strand direction is indicated using white lines with arrowheads. The data is stratified by rows based on strand orientation ('+' and '-'). The right track presents gene structures with gray rectangles for genes, pink rectangles for exons, and light blue rectangles for introns, with black labeling. Both tracks use the same genomic x-axis for consistency.
