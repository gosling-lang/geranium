The visualization consists of six genomic range annotation tracks displayed in two vertical arrangements, each containing multiple overlays. The layout is linear, focusing on chromosome 3, ranging from positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. Each track represents different datasets such as "Cyverse-QUBES," "HiGlass," "GmGDV," "IGV," and "Corces et al." Different genomic features, including genes, exons, and introns, are encoded with markings like rectangles, triangles, and text. Tracks are stratified by strand category, marked in different colors for positive and negative strands: blue and red. Exons are highlighted in purple, while other genomic elements use grayscale shades. Rectangles and lines indicate genomic locations, enriched with gene names and strand direction, enhancing genomic comprehension. The title identifies regions and datasets, facilitating comparative analysis across genomic annotations.
