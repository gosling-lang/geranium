A comprehensive visualization displays genomic data in both circular and linear formats, linked by an interactive brush. The circular view represents the entire genome with a focus on chromosome 1, featuring tracks for ideograms, text annotations, and rectangles indicating genomic gains (in blue) and losses of heterozygosity (in orange). The line-connection track highlights structural variations, categorized by shape and color, such as 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.'

The linear view provides a detailed look at chromosome 1, with a series of overlaid tracks. These include gene annotations, scatter plots for point mutations differentiated by color along the x-axis representing distances to previous mutations, and range annotations. Additional layers showcase insertions and deletions in yellow and green rectangles, while a copy number variant track visualizes aptitudes in light grey bars. Throughout both views, extensive use of overlays and interactive elements enables an exploratory and detailed examination of the provided genomic data, coordinated through linking identifiers.
