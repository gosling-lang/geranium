The visualization titled "Matrix Visualization" with the subtitle "Comparison of Micro-C and Hi-C for HFFc6 Cells" presents a horizontal arrangement of data tracks focusing on a specific genomic interval on chromosome 7, between positions 77,700,000 and 81,000,000. This figure consists of a set of vertical and horizontal views.

The vertical view contains vertical bar charts showing peaks from 'HFFc6_H3K4me3', depicted in dark green, and 'HFFc6_ATAC', colored orange. Overlaid tracks for 'HFFC6_CTCF' feature navy blue bars alongside genomic positions marked by pink rightward and green leftward triangles indicating strand orientations.

Two horizontal views are positioned side by side. The first horizontal view includes three main components: bar charts representing 'HFFc6_H3K4me3' in dark green and 'HFFc6_ATAC' in orange, a track for 'HFFC6_CTCF', and a matrix for 'HFFc6_Micro-C' that uses a color intensity warm range to encode values based on genomic coordinates.

The second horizontal view mirrors the first yet features a matrix for 'HFFc6_Hi-C', once again utilizing color intensity to indicate value. Both matrices emphasize interactions or density within the specified genomic regions.

Finally, a track for "Epilogos (hg38)" is shown, incorporating various categories like 'Active TSS' and '
