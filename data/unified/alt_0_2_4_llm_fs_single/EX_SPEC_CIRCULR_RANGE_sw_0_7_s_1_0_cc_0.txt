A circular bar chart with a stacked alignment visualizes a vector dataset, displaying genomic data across the entire hg38 assembly. The chart consists of bars radiating outward from the center, with their positions determined by the "position" field and their heights by the "peak" values. The bars are uniformly colored pink, and the x-axis is labeled with genomic positions. The visualization employs a circular layout with a center radius of 0.3, a static layout configuration, and spacing of 1 between elements.
