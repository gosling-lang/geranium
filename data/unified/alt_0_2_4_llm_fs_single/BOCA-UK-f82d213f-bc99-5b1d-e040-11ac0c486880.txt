The visualization displays genomic data in both circular and linear views, linked via an interactive brush on chromosome 1. The circular view includes an ideogram and multiple tracks: a text annotation track titled "Putative Driver," showcasing genomic positions with black text; two range annotation tracks "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" using sky blue and dark orange rectangles respectively; and a connections track displaying lines in varying colors, representing different structural variations such as 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.' The linear view expands on chromosome 1, featuring similar tracks along with a gene annotation track, a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation," and additional range annotation tracks. The scatter plot marks distances between mutations with colored points based on mutation subtype. The visualization incorporates a comprehensive genomic representation, emphasizing chromosomal variations and their annotation across both views.
