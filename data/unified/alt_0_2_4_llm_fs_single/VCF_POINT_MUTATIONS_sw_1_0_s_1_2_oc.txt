The visualization is a linear scatter plot representing point mutations from a VCF file, focusing on genomic positions. The x-axis displays genomic coordinates across different chromosomes, while the y-axis quantifies expression based on the distance to previous mutations. Each point's color corresponds to a mutation subtype, including 'C>A', 'C>G', 'C>T', 'T>A', 'T>C', and 'T>G'. This visually differentiates mutation types, with distinct colors enhancing category recognition. The scatter plot layout is vertical, and the information is overlaid on a genome assembly reference of hg38, which allows exploration and detailed study of point mutations.
