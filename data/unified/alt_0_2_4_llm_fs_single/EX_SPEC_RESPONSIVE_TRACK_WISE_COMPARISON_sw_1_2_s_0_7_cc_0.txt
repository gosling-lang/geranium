A series of bar charts and genomic annotation tracks are displayed horizontally. Each chart represents genomic data for specific chromosomal regions on chromosomes 12 and 8. The annotation tracks at the top and bottom exhibit genomic ranges with gene information overlaid with text, colored in pink and blue, indicating strands and exonic regions. The bar charts are titled "Sample 1," "Sample 2," and "Sample 3," showing expression levels using bars along the y-axis. Bars are colored differently for each sample: sky blue, green, and pink for chromosome 12, and sky blue, sky blue, and purple for chromosome 8. Each chart provides a detailed view of the expression peaks across the genomic intervals specified on the x-axis.
