The visualization presents a circular and a linear view aligned vertically and interconnected by a blue brush on the circular ideogram. The circular view comprises the entire genome and features tracks such as an ideogram, a point annotation track titled 'Putative Driver', and two range annotation tracks 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' displaying genomic ranges in sky blue and dark orange rectangles, respectively. Another track showcases line connections between genomic positions, categorized by colors representing 'Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion' types.

The linear view, corresponding to chromosome 1, replicates similar tracks and introduces additional ones including a gene annotation track, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation', and two range annotation tracks. In the scatter plot, each point's position reflects the distance to a preceding mutation, colored diversely based on 'SUBTYPE'. The first range annotation track, showing 'Insertion' and 'Deletion', depicts rectangles in yellow and green. The 'Copy Number Variants' track represents 'total_cn' in light gray rectangles. Both views leverage an HG19 assembly and present comprehensive genomic insights using various architectural styles, ensuring clarity in data visualization.
