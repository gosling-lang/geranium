The circular bar chart presents genomic data for chromosome 12, spanning from positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. It displays expression levels on the y-axis using bars, stratified by multiple sample categories. Each category corresponds to a different row within the circular arrangement, with distinct colors indicating each sample type. Data transformations applied filter out unwanted samples, focusing on relevant genomic intervals, while colors offer a nominal representation of categorical differences. The visualization emphasizes the unique patterns across sample categories, allowing for comparative analysis of genomic peaks.
