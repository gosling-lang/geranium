The visualization is a circular scatter plot with two tracks depicting genomic data from chromosome 1, covering positions 1 to 3,000,500. The left track displays a circular scatter plot where expression values are encoded with points on both the y and size axes. Each point's color represents different categories for samples 1 to 4. The right track features a similar scatter plot but stratified by rows for each sample category, again using color to differentiate. The layout emphasizes a clear view of variations within the chromosome, allowing for easy comparison across samples.
