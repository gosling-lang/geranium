The visualization consists of two main views: a circular overview and a linear detailed view linked by an interactive brush. The circular view displays the entire genome in a circular ideogram with tracks for putative drivers, gains, LOH, and structural variations, highlighting connections with colors indicating categories like 'Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', and others. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, showing detailed tracks for drivers, point mutations, insertions, deletions, and copy number variants. Each mutation type is color-coded, providing an in-depth analysis of genomic variations. The layout emphasizes both an overview and specific genomic detail, with interactive elements for deeper exploration.
