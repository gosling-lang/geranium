A comprehensive linear visualization showcases diverse visual encoding methods over chromosome 1, spanning from positions 1 to 3,000,500. This visualization includes nine tracks. The first track is a heat map that uses color intensity to encode expression values across categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4.' Four bar charts, in both stacked and separated forms, depict expression data with colors representing different categories. A line and scatter plot overlay visualize peak data with varying point sizes. Two scatter plots depict data with points colored according to categories and sized based on expression values. An area chart displays filled areas under curves, and bar charts showcasing genomic intervals use separate colors for minimum and maximum expression values, enriched with tooltip information for genomic start, end positions, and peaks. Finally, a within-link chart illustrates connections between genomic intervals, enriched with tooltip details. The title is 'Visual Encoding,' and the subtitle is 'Gosling provides diverse visual encoding methods.'
