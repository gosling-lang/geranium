A horizontal arrangement of three linear bar charts visualizes multivec data. Each chart corresponds to genomic regions: the first and third charts show chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000, while the middle chart displays chromosome 9 within the same interval. The bars represent 'peak' values along the y-axis. The left and middle charts are colored green, while the right chart is purple, each with a white stroke. The visualization adapts to screen size changes, switching to a vertical layout below a width of 1200 pixels, ensuring data remains accessible on various devices.
