The visualization is a circular bar chart representing genomic data from chromosome 1, between positions 1 and 3,000,500. It uses a multivec file to display data for four samples ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'), with each sample represented in different colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The layout is circular and static, with a vertical arrangement of tracks. The x-axis encodes genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative expression values. The chart is layered by rows for each sample category, visually highlighted by the color of the bars. The interactive legend on the chart facilitates the identification of samples.
