A linear area chart visualizes data from a multivec file, depicting the entire genome of hg38. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis shows quantitative peak values. The area under the curve is colored pink, providing a continuous representation of expression levels. Titled 'Basic Marks: area' with the subtitle 'Tutorial Examples,' this chart offers a clear view of the data's variability across different genomic regions.
