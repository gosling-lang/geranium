The visualization is a parallel arrangement of five linear views, each representing a different chromosome from chr1 to chr5. Each view consists of two tracks: an area chart and an ideogram with text, rectangles, and triangles.

The area charts visualize multivec data, displaying genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis. Each chart is color-coded according to samples, with colors such as blue, orange, green, and red.

The ideograms display cytogenetic band data, with genomic intervals shown along the x-axis. Rectangles are colored based on density levels ranging from white to black, indicating regions of varying chromatin states. Purple rectangles represent 'gvar' bands, while maroon triangles indicate centromeric 'acen' regions.

These tracks provide a comprehensive view of both genomic expression and structural features across the chromosomes, utilizing a consistent color scheme to differentiate between samples and annotate chromosomal features.
