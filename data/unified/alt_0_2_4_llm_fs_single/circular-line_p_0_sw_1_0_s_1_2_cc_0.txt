This visualization is a multi-layer circular chart representing multivec data across chromosome 1, from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The chart is stratified into four rows, labeled 'sample 1' through 'sample 4', with data points expressed both as lines and points. The line encodes quantitative values of 'peak', while point sizes vary based on the same 'peak' values, so the height of the point indicates the expression. The genome's position is mapped to the circular x-axis. Each sample is distinguished by unique colors—blue, orange, green, and red—shown in the legend, enhancing differentiation between data sets.
