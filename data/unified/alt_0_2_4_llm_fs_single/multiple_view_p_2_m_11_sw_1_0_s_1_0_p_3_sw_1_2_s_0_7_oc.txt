The visualization comprises linked views in a vertical arrangement emphasizing user interaction. At the top, a linear scatter plot displays multivec data for chromosome 1, with genomic positions on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis, encoded by color across different samples. The scatter plot allows categorization by sample through color-coding. Below, a circular line chart and a linear area chart provide an overview of the same data. The circular chart shows connections using lines for different genomic intervals, stratified by sample. The linear area chart represents data in shaded areas, color-matched to sample categories. Interactive brushes in the circular and linear charts enable dynamic updates to the detailed view by adjusting the position and range, enhancing data exploration. The title is "Visual Linking" with a subtitle guiding users to manipulate the charts for updated views. This configuration facilitates detailed data analysis across multiple tracks, using a genomic dataset with sample-specific visual encodings.
