A vertically arranged multi-track bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file of chromosome 1 spanning 1 to 3,000,500. It contains four horizontal tracks for 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is represented in a different color: blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The x-axis shows genomic intervals while the y and ye-axes display quantitative values between 'peak_min' and 'peak_max'. Bars' color encodes the 'sample' field. Additional features include black outlines of the bars, and interactive tooltips reveal genomic position and peak values.
