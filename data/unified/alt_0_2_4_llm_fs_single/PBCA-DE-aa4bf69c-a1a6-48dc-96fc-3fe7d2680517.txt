The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view, arranged vertically. The circular view displays a complete ideogram of the human genome (hg19 assembly), highlighting specific genomic features with rectangular bars. It features tracks for "Putative Driver," "Gain," and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)." These use color-coding to represent data categories such as sky blue for gains and dark orange for LOH regions.

In contrast, the linear view provides a detailed genomic visualization of chromosome 1, corresponding to the region brushed in the circular view. The linear view includes multiple tracks: an ideogram with colored cytobands, a "Putative Driver" text track showing gene annotations, a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" with color-coded mutation subtypes, and detailed tracks for "Insertion" and "Deletion" events. Another track titled "Copy Number Variants" uses gray bars to indicate variant frequency. The visualization employs interactive elements such as brushing and detailed tooltips for data exploration.
