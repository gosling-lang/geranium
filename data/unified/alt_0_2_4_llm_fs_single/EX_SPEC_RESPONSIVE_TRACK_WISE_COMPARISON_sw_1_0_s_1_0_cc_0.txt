A linear visualization composed of two genomic range annotation tracks and six bar charts spans chromosomes 12 and 8. The genomic tracks use a green color on chromosome 12 and light blue on chromosome 8 to indicate strands and gene annotations like exons and gene names. The bar charts represent three samples with quantitative peak values on the y-axis across specific genomic intervals for each chromosome. Chromosome 12's samples are colored pink, green, and purple, while chromosome 8's are uniformly sky blue. This setup provides a comprehensive view of gene expression and annotation across selected genomic intervals.
