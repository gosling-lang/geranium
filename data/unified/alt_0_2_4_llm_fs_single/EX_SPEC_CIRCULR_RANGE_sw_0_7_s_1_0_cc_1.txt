A circular bar chart visualizes a vector file in a circular layout, representing genomic data of the hg38 assembly. The x-axis denotes genomic positions, and the y-axis represents quantitative peak values. The bars are sky blue, with a configuration that aligns the bars in a stacked format around a center radius. The visualization uses a static representation with a specific spacing parameter and outer and inner radii defining the circular boundary. Data is accessed via a URL, focusing on the peak values at each genomic position.
