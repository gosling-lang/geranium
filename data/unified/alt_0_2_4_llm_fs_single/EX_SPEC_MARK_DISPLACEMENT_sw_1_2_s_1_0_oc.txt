The visualization titled "Mark Displacement" presents a genomic data layout with overlapping marks handled using displacement options. The display is organized into multiple tracks and sections.

1. **Title and Subtitle**: The main title is "Mark Displacement," with a subtitle emphasizing repositioning marks to manage visual overlaps.

2. **Tracks and Layouts**:
   - **Transcript Track on Chromosome 3**: Shows the hg38 transcript data with a maximum of 15 rows. The position range is between 142,500,000 and 143,000,000. It contains arrows and text labels, with color coding based on strand orientation: blue for "+" strands and orange for "-" strands.
   - **Likely Benign Variants on Chromosome 2**: Focuses on a segment from 126,800,000 to 127,700,000. The visual consists of green points with text labels showing base sequences (A, T, G, C) above them.
   - **Chromosome 17 Display**: Displays a different chromosome segment containing genomic points colored according to clinical significance categories such as "Pathogenic" (pink shades) and "Likely Benign" (green). Each point's position encodes significance.

3. **Displacement and Styling**:
   - Displacement techniques are used in the transcript and variant tracks to prevent overlap, ensuring clarity in visual representation.
   - A consistent color theme is implemented, particularly in point markings, aiding quick visual
