The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view arranged vertically, linked by an interactive brush. The circular view illustrates the entire genome with five tracks, including an ideogram, a text annotation track titled "Putative Driver", two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)", and a connection track. The annotation tracks display genomic features in distinct colors: blue for "Gain" and orange for "LOH". The connection track uses lines to indicate structural variations, colored by categories such as "Translocation", "Duplication", and "Inversion".

In the linear view, focusing on chromosome 1, several tracks provide detailed genomic data. These include an ideogram, a text track for putative driver genes, a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" showing mutation distances with color-coded mutation types, and two range annotation tracks denoting "Insertion" and "Deletion". There is also a track for "Copy Number Variants" and additional tracks depicting structural variations with connections and triangles representing strand orientation. This comprehensive genomic visualization allows in-depth analysis of chromosomal features and variations in a dataset.
