A series of three horizontally arranged bar charts visualize genomic data from a multivec file, each focusing on different genomic intervals. The first bar chart highlights chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000, using pink bars to represent data peaks. The second chart, centered on the same genomic range of chromosome 9, incorporates sky blue bars. The third chart revisits chromosome 12, again displaying sky blue bars. Each chart utilizes a linear layout and includes white strokes for bar distinction, adhering to a consistent width of 864 pixels and a height of 156 pixels. The figures collectively utilize responsive design, with an arrangement that adjusts from horizontal to vertical depending on viewport width, specifically below 1200 pixels, facilitated by a linking ID system for seamless data interaction.
