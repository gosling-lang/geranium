The visualization is an area chart in a linear layout, representing a multivec file that features the entire genome of hg38. The x-axis is genomic, showing various chromosome intervals, while the y-axis is quantitative, displaying expression values. The chart is titled "Basic Marks: area" with a subtitle "Tutorial Examples." The chart uses a purple color to fill the area under the curve, and it highlights the 'peak' values for 'sample 1'. The layout is horizontal with a defined height and width, allowing for clear visualization of genomic data distribution.
