A circular bar chart with a vertical arrangement visualizes genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The chart displays expression values for four samples, grouped into separate rows. Each sample row is represented by bars of distinct colors: blue for 'sample 1', orange for 'sample 2', green for 'sample 3', and red for 'sample 4'. The x-axis denotes genomic positions, while the y-axis corresponds to the expression values. The visualization includes interactive tooltips providing details such as start and end positions, expression values, and sample information.
