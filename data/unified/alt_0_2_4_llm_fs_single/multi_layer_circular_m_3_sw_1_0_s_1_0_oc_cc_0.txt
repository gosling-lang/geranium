A circular bar chart visualizes multiple genomic samples across chromosome 12 from positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The data uses a multivec file and is displayed in a circular layout with individual tracks for each sample, excluding “sample -”. Each track varies in opacity based on the value of the 'peak' field, stratifying data into ranges with opacities of 1, 0.33, and 0.33 at different intervals. Each track is represented in a unique color from a range of blues, oranges, greens, reds, and purples. This visualization references the work by Javed et al. on the graphical perception of multiple time series.
