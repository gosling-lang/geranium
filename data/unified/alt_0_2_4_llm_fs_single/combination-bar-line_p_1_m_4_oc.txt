The visualization consists of two vertically arranged, linear charts displaying genomic data across chromosome 1, from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top chart is an area plot stratified into four rows representing different samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4'). Each area is colored distinctly, and the y-axis represents quantitative expressions of 'peak' values. The bottom chart is a multicolor line plot depicting the same samples, with lines representing variations in expression along the same genomic positions. The x-axis for both charts represents genomic positions, displaying intervals across the specified range.
