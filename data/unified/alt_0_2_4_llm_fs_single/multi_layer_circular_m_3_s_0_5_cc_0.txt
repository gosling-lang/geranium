The circular bar chart visualizes genomic data from chromosome 12, spanning positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. It uses a multivec file to display data with a circular layout. The bars represent quantitative peak values distributed over eight categories, with rows colored blue, orange, green, red, purple, brown, pink, and gray. The categories are distinguished by color, with each category corresponding to a specific sample. The height of each bar is proportional to the quantitative measure of the "peak" field, with the y-axis representing these values without a visible axis. The chart's design allows for comparative analysis across different samples in a visually stratified manner.
