A Hi-C visualization in a linear layout that overlays multiple tracks, showcasing a genomic matrix for the hg38 assembly. The matrix represents interaction frequencies, colored by intensity using a hot color scale, with axes displaying genomic intervals. Overlaid on this are annotations including vertical lines in purple on the x-axis and horizontal lines in pink on the y-axis. Additional tracks display data from chromosomes 6, 7, and 8 as bars, encoded with stroke color by category, and datasets represented as sky blue points with varied sizes. The visualization spans genomic regions from 800 million to 1.8 billion, focusing on intricate interactions visualized with an annotation style that uses dashed lines for emphasis. The title reads "Hi-C Matrix" with the subtitle "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations," highlighting the detailed genomic annotations integrated with the matrix display.
