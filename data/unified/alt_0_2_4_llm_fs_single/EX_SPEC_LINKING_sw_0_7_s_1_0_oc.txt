The visualization consists of a linked view composed of three charts: a circular bar chart and two linear bar charts. The circular chart, which includes an interactive brush, displays genomic intervals on the x-axis, with expression levels represented as bars on the y-axis. The data is categorized into four samples, each indicated by distinct bar colors. The first linear chart, placed parallel to the circular chart, shows the entire chromosome 1, with rows and colors similar to those in the circular chart. The second linear chart presents a detailed view of a specific region (from 160,000,000 to 200,000,000) on chromosome 1, linked interactively to the brush from the circular chart, allowing users to refine or change the focus as desired. The overall title of the visualization is "Visual Linking," with a subtitle guiding the interaction: "Change the position and range of brushes to update the detail view on the bottom."
