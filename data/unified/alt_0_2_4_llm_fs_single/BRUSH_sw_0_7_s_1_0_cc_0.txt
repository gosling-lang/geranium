The visualization displays two linear line charts showcasing genomic data along chromosome 1. The top chart features a brush tool, linking the data to the bottom chart. Purple lines in the top chart represent genomic expressions, with a highlighted brush region in steel blue. The bottom chart, titled "Example: Brushing and Linking," shows detailed expressions within the brushed region, illustrated by green lines, providing a zoomed-in view. The linking enables seamless navigation between the global and detailed genomic contexts.
