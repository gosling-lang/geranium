The visualization consists of two charts in a linear vertical arrangement, highlighting genomic data along chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top chart is an area chart showing samples 1 to 4, with the x-axis representing genomic positions and the y-axis displaying quantitative expression values. The color of the areas represents different sample categories, with values from a ‘multivec’ data file.

The bottom chart combines a scatter plot and a bar chart in an overlay alignment. Points and bars indicate expression values stratified across different sample categories. The chart uses point markers and bars to visualize peaks, with each sample being displayed on separate rows. Colors distinguish samples, offering clear comparison. Tooltips provide genomic positions and quantitative values for additional interaction.
