A circular visualization displays genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. The left track is a circular area chart stratified by rows for four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each represented by a different color. Peaks in expression values are encoded by the area heights. The right track features a circular link plot displaying genomic connections within chromosome 1. The connections, with varying transparency, indicate different categories based on start position 's1'. The plot is informative for visualizing both quantitative expression data and genomic relationships.
