A scatter plot in a linear layout visualizes data from a multivec file, displaying the entire genome of hg38. The x-axis represents genomic positions across different chromosomes, while the y-axis shows quantitative expression values labeled 'peak'. Each point's size also corresponds to 'peak', enhancing the data's visual impact. The visualization utilizes a consistent color scheme, sizing points to convey quantitative information effectively. The chart is titled "Basic Marks: point" with a subtitle "Tutorial Examples", emphasizing its instructional purpose.
