This visualization is a bar chart with overlaid rule marks, presented in a linear layout. It displays genomic data across various chromosomes with expression values represented as light gray bars. The chart includes horizontal and vertical rule marks for annotation. Vertical blue dashed lines indicate specific genomic positions, while horizontal red dashed lines represent quantitative thresholds with varying stroke widths. The title is "Rule Mark," and it includes a subtitle "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines." The data is sourced from a multivec file and a JSON file.
