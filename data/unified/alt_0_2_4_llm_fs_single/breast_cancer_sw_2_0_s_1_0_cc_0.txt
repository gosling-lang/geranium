A linear genomic visualization displaying chromosome 1 features in five layers. The first layer is an ideogram with color-coded regions indicating different staining patterns: gneg, gpos, gvar, and acen. The second layer shows gene annotations, differentiated by strand orientation using triangles; blue for the positive strand and orange for the negative. The third and fourth layers are copy number variant tracks showing genomic intervals in green rectangles. The bottom layer visualizes structural variants, with lines connecting positions across the genome, colored and styled to represent different classes such as tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions. The visualization is based on data from CSV and BED files, emphasizing genomic intervals in a comprehensive manner.
