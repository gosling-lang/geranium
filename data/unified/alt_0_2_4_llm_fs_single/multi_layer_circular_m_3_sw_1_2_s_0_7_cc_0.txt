A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The chart contains multiple layers, each representing data from different samples, excluding "sample -," across 16 categories. Bars, colored distinctly for each sample category, represent genomic expression levels. The y-axis encodes the 'peak' values, with several sub-axes to show varying opacity levels, highlighting different data ranges. The layout is described as circular, with each concentric circle corresponding to a specific sample. The referenced description is "Graphical perception of Multiple Time Series" by Javed et al., TVCG 2010.
