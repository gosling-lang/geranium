A linear visualization with overlaid tracks depicts genomic data. The first track is a green bar chart representing genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, ranging up to 0.003. This track is annotated with green dashed horizontal and vertical lines, created using a rule mark to emphasize specific genomic positions. Additional overlaid tracks include horizontally and vertically dashed purple lines, with varying stroke widths corresponding to quantitative expression values. The title is "Rule Mark" with the subtitle "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines."
