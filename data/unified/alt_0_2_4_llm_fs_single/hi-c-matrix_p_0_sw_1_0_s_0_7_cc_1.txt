A Hi-C matrix visualization displays genomic interactions using multiple overlaid tracks. The chart is titled "Hi-C Matrix" with the subtitle "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations." The main matrix employs a heatmap to represent genomic data, with both x and y axes showing intervals corresponding to the genome, and color intensity encoding the interaction values. Overlaid blue rules on the x- and y-axes highlight specific genomic positions, enhancing clarity. Additional annotations include a track employing pink-colored points to denote expression levels, further enriched by size variations. The layout is linear, oriented horizontally, spanning coordinates within the 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 interval.
