The visualization consists of a scatter plot in a linear layout featuring multivec data from chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. Each point's position on the x-axis represents a genomic position, while the y-axis denotes the quantitative 'peak' value. The size and height of points are proportional to the 'peak' value, providing a visual cue for data magnitude. Points are color-coded based on four distinct categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', enhancing differentiation and pattern recognition. The visualization utilizes a transparent overlay (50% opacity) for the points, ensuring visual clarity and data density observation. Tooltip functionality enhances interactivity, offering detailed information about the genomic position and category of each point.
