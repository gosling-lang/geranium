The visualization features two genomic tracks in a linear layout, focusing on a region of chromosome 1 between 136,750 and 139,450 base pairs. The top track is a coverage bar chart, titled "example_higlass.bam," displaying the number of reads aligned in gray, with heights indicating coverage levels. The bottom track represents a pileup of reads using rectangles, stratified by structural variation types. Categories include "normal read," "deletion," "inversion," "duplication," and others, each shown in distinct colors, such as gray, orange, green, and red. The visualization is interactive, with a tooltip revealing genomic coordinates and structural variant details. The title "Pileup Track Using BAM Data" emphasizes its focus on sequence alignment visualized with BAM files.
