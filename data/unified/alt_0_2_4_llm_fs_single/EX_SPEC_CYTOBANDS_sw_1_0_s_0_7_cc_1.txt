A parallel arrangement of linear area charts visualizes multivec data across chromosomes 1 to 5. Each chart displays genomic positions on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis. Color encodes samples, using a palette ranging from blue to maroon. Below each area chart is an ideogram, showing cytogenetic bands with colors indicating density, genetic variants, and centromere positions. Purple rectangles and maroon triangles represent specific regions, with text labels indicating band information. The assembly used is hg38, with static display and a central radius of 0.2.
