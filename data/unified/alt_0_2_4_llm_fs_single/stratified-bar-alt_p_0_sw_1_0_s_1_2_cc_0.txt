The visualization is a multi-row bar chart in a linear layout displaying a multivec file, with a focus on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The chart is stratified by four samples, each represented by a different color: blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis represents genomic intervals, while the y-axis shows the expression values ranging from minimum to maximum. The chart includes a tooltip providing details on genomic position, minimum and maximum values, and sample categorization. The layout supports zooming and interaction, and the assembly is hg38.
