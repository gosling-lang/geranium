A circular line chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying data from chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart is organized into multiple nominal rows, each representing a sample. The lines are colored differently for each category, highlighting peaks within specified quantitative domains. The visualization contains multiple overlays with varying opacity settings and does not utilize legends. The reference for this visualization is "Graphical perception of Multiple Time Series" by Javed et al., TVCG 2010.
