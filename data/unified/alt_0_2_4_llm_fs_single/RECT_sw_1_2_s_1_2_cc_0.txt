The visualization is a linear ideogram showing chromosome 1 of the human genome in the HG38 assembly. It features a series of colored rectangles representing cytogenetic bands along the chromosome. These rectangles are colored based on the "Stain" category, with color variations indicating different types of chromosomal stains such as gneg, gpos, and gvar. The x-axis displays genomic positions with ticks labeled at intervals, and an axis on the top provides a visual guide to position along the chromosome. The layout is horizontal, with rectangular marks outlined in white, and the chart is titled "Basic Marks: Rect" with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples." The ideogram provides a detailed, zoomable view of the chromosome, enriched with a variety of colors to denote different chromosomal features or categories.
