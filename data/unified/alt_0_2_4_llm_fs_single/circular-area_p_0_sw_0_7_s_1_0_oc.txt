The circular area chart visualizes genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. This visualization uses a multivec file format and employs an area mark to represent quantitative 'peak' values. The area is stratified into rows based on the 'sample' category, with four distinct samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4') each represented by a unique color. The x-axis displays genomic positions, while the y-axis shows peak values. The chart features a central radius of 0.5, and interactive tooltips provide additional genomic information for selected positions. The visualization is constructed in a circular layout, emphasizing the relationship between genomic positions and peak values across different samples.
