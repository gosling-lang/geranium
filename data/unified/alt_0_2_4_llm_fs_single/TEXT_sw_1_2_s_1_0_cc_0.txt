A linear text visualization displays genomic data from a multivec file. The visualization shows the genome with chromosome labels on the x-axis and quantitative expression levels on the y-axis. The text marks represent nucleotide bases (A, T, G, C) in different colors: blue for 'A', orange for 'T', green for 'G', and red for 'C'. The title is "Basic Marks: Text" and the subtitle is "Tutorial Examples."
