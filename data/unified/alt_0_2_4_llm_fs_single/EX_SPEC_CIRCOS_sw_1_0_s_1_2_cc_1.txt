A circular visualization titled "Circos" in a stacked layout displays genomic data. The chart consists of three main tracks. The outermost track features a bar chart depicting genomic positions along the x-axis and quantitative peaks along the y-axis. The bars are colored green. The middle track displays a circular ideogram using nominal colors to represent different chromosome stains. The innermost track shows connections within the genome, with lines colored according to a nominal scale. The visualization uses datasets from various sources, including vector and CSV files, and offers a comprehensive view of genomic relationships.
