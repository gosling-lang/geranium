A linear area chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying the entire genome of hg38. The genomic positions are shown on the x-axis, while quantitative expression values, encoded as an area plot, are on the y-axis. The area is filled in sky blue. Titled "Basic Marks: area," the chart serves as a tutorial example, offering a clear view of the gene expression across different chromosomes.
