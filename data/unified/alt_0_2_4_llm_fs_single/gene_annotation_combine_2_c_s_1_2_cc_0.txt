The visualization displays a linear layout with Chromosome 3 data ranging from 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. It consists of two vertical genomic range annotation tracks side by side. The left track is titled "HiGlass," showcasing gene annotations with text labels and right/left triangles representing gene strands. Blue denotes positive strands, while orange highlights negative strands. The right track, named "Cyverse-QUBES," also features gene annotations. Text labels appear in pink, with right triangulated icons in sky blue and left triangles in pink. Purple rectangles and lines indicate exon regions, with a distinct stroke for exons. Both tracks display categories stratified by rows and colors, providing a clear visual distinction between gene strands and structural annotations.
