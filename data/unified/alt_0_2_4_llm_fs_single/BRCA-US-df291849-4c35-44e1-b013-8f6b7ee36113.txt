The visualization consists of a circular ideogram coupled with a linear arrangement of genomic data on chromosome 1. The circular view includes several tracks displaying genomic features and structural variations with connections visualized in different colors representing categories like 'Gain', 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)', 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and different types of inversions. In the linear view, similar features are detailed with additional tracks for gene annotations, point mutations, insertions, deletions, and copy number variants. The circular brush allows interactive linking with the linear view, helping to focus on specific genomic regions. The visualization employs data sourced from csv and vcf files, utilizing various data transformations to highlight significant genomic variations.
