The visualization consists of two vertically arranged linear charts displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top chart is a scatter plot, where points represent quantitative 'peak' values across genomic 'position.' The points are color-coded based on the sample categories: 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' The x-axis represents the genomic position, while the y-axis shows the expression values with gridlines for easy reference.

The bottom chart combines a bar chart and a line chart. It stratifies data by rows corresponding to each sample category. The genomic position is displayed on the x-axis, while the y-axis represents peak values, shown as both bars and lines. The size of lines is determined by the quantitative peak value. Each sample is color-coded consistently across both charts, with a legend provided for reference.

Data is sourced from a multivec file, accessed via a specified URL. Tooltips provide detailed insights into genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample names. The charts are designed to be interactive, with a focus on clarity and differentiation between sample categories.
