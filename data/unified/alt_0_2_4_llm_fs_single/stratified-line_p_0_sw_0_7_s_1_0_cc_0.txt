**Description Generation for Visualization:**

This linear layout visualization represents a multivec file, showcasing chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The chart is stratified into four rows corresponding to 'sample 1' through 'sample 4,' each rendered as distinct line plots. The x-axis represents genomic positions while the y-axis illustrates the quantitative peaks from each sample. Points are included in the visualization, their sizes encoding the same peak values. The color of lines and points differentiates between samples, utilizing a diverse palette: blue for 'sample 1,' orange for 'sample 2,' green for 'sample 3,' and red for 'sample 4.' Interactive tooltips provide additional data context for each genomic position, peak value, and sample category. This visualization aims to provide clear comparative insights across multiple genomic samples within a defined chromosomal region.
