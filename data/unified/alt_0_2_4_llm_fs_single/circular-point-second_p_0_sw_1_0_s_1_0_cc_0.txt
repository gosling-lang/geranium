A circular scatter plot visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The position and size of points are encoded using the data field 'peak.' Points are colored based on categories 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4' in blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The opacity of the points is set to 0.5. The plot includes tooltips for start and end positions, peak values, and sample information.
