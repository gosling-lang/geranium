A linear layout visualization displays data from a multivec file, representing genomic data for chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The visualization consists of two main tracks arranged vertically. The top track features an area chart, showing quantitative peaks for four samples, stratified by rows and differentiated by color. The bottom track presents a bar chart, where each bar displays the range of expression values. The genomic data is depicted on the x-axis, while peaks are shown on the y-axis in both tracks. The charts include interactive tooltips providing detailed information about start and end genomic positions, value ranges, and sample categories.
