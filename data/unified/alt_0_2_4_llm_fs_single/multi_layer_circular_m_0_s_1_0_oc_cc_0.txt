The visualization is a multi-row circular scatter plot displaying genomic data from chromosome 12, spanning from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The arrangement features eight concentric rows, each representing different samples such as 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and more, with rows colored in distinct shades like blue, orange, green, and red. Points on the plot mark the genomic positions and are colored based on sample categories. The y-axis corresponds to expression values, indicated within a quantitative scale. The visualization relies on a multivec data format, filtering out specific entries, and uses a circular layout for effective representation of genomic intervals.
