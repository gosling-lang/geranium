The visualization titled "SARS-CoV-2" is a linear layout featuring genomic data from the SARS-CoV-2 genome, as sourced from the WashU Virus Genome Browser, NCBI, and GISAID. It displays genomic intervals of NC_045512.2. The top track, titled "NC_045512.2 Genes," uses green rectangles to represent gene locations along the genome, delineated by purple lines. Text annotations for genes are indicated in green.

Beneath it, the "S Protein Annotation" track shows protein domains as colored rectangles. These domains include receptor-binding domains and heptad repeats, each color-coded for differentiation.

The "NC_045512.2 Sequence" track visualizes the nucleotide sequence through a bar chart, where the height of bars represents nucleotide counts, and different nucleotides are color-coded within the A, T, G, and C categories.

At the bottom, the track titled "TRS-L-Dependent Recombination Events" shows connections across genomic positions, visualized with sky blue arcs indicating recombination events.

The interactive brush on the top track allows users to link and explore details further in connected tracks. The visualization is color-rich with annotations to guide understanding, making genomic exploration intuitive.
