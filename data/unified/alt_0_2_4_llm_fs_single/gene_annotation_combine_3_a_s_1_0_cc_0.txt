The visualization is a genomic range annotation chart in a linear layout, focusing on chromosome 3 from positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. It includes three vertically aligned tracks, each showing different aspects of gene annotations. 

1. **Track 1**: Titled "Cyverse-QUBES," it combines text, triangles, and colored rectangles to represent gene structures. The text indicates gene names, with purple text color, right-facing triangles in purple for forward strands, and left-facing triangles in pink for reverse strands. Genes are also shown as sky blue rectangles with lines.

2. **Track 2**: This track uses purple and pink rectangles to represent genomic features such as exons and introns, stratified by strand.

3. **Track 3**: Titled "GmGDV," it mirrors Track 1 with additional color coding in blue and orange to differentiate between strands. It similarly layers text and geometric shapes for gene annotation.

Each track is aligned similarly, making it easier to compare annotations across the chromosome interval.
