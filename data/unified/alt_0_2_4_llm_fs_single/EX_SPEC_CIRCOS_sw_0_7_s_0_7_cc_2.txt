The visualization is a circular plot titled "Circos," illustrating genomic data. It consists of three layers: a circular bar chart, a circular ideogram, and a circular chart with connections. The bar chart displays genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis using purple bars. The ideogram shows chromosome intervals with color-coded rectangles, representing different categories. The connection chart illustrates genomic relationships using colored lines, where the color varies based on the category of the data field. The color scheme includes shades of blue, orange, and green. The layout is stacked within a circular arrangement, and the visualization is static. The data sources include multivec and CSV files, showcasing various genomic attributes and connections.
