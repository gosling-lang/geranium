The visualization is a linear genomic display of chromosome 3, spanning from 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. It features two horizontal arrangements, each comprising vertical stacks of tracks. The first arrangement includes three tracks: "Cyverse-QUBES," visualizing genes as black text, gray triangles, light gray rectangles, and gray lines; a second track with gray and light gray rectangles representing genomic elements; and "GmGDV," displaying genes in blue and red with annotations. The second horizontal arrangement mirrors this structure: "HiGlass" showing blue and red directional cues; "IGV," with navy elements and white lines for gene directionality; and "Corces et al.," using blue and red elements for genes. Each track stratifies content by strand orientation, highlighting various genomic features using color-coded and shaped visual elements.
