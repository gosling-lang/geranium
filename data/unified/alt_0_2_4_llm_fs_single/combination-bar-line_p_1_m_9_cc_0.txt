The visualization features two aligned charts in a linear layout, displaying genomic data for chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top chart includes a combination of line and bar plots, stratified by color for four samples, 'sample 1' through 'sample 4,' each represented in distinct colors such as blue, orange, green, and red. This chart displays expression values along the y-axis and uses lines and bars to indicate data peaks. The expression value is also encoded in the size of bars. The bottom chart is a scatter plot showing the same genomic range, with points colored according to the same categorical scheme to represent different samples. Both charts offer tooltips providing detailed information about genomic positions, expression values, and sample categories.
