This visualization is a circular bar chart showcasing genomic intervals on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 in a circular layout. The data is derived from a multivec file, highlighting two categories: 'sample 1' and 'sample 2'. Each category is represented by different colors, with bars indicating the expression values on the y and ye-axes. The size of the bars varies to depict the range between minimum and maximum peak values, and they are stratified into rows corresponding to each sample category. The chart includes a legend showing the color mapping for each sample, and tooltips provide additional details like position, minimum and maximum values, and the sample name.
