A circular and linear genomic visualization uses Gosling to explore genomic data from hg19. The circular view shows a full genome ideogram with tracks for 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' colored in sky blue and orange, respectively. A brush links to a linear view focused on chromosome 1. The circular view includes connections denoting structural variations like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.' The linear view features an ideogram, point mutation scatterplot, and genomic features like insertions, deletions, and copy number variants. The scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation' displays VCF data, using point colors to represent mutation subtypes, such as 'C>A' and 'T>G.'
