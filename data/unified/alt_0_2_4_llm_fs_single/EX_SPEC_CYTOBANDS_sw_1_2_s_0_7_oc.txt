The visualization is a parallel arrangement of linear genomic tracks. It displays data across chromosomes 1 to 5 using area marks to represent quantitative 'peak' values from a multivec file. Each chromosome view includes two tracks: the top track shows the area plots with distinct colors indicating different 'sample' categories, and the bottom track is an ideogram visualizing cytogenetic bands. Text labels denote band names, and rectangles represent 'Density' values with a grayscale range, while special bands like 'acen' are indicated with maroon triangles. The layout is static, using the hg38 assembly, with distinct intervals for each chromosome. The tracks are horizontally oriented with a consistent style, and inter-track alignment is ensured by linking genomic domains using a unique linking ID for each chromosome view.
