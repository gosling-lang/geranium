The Hi-C matrix visualization displays genomic interactions using an overlaid set of tracks. This includes a matrix representing genomic intervals on both x- and y-axes, with color intensity indicating interaction frequencies. It features genome annotations for chromosomes 5 to 10 within the interval of 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000. Vertical blue and horizontal pink lines provide specific genomic position highlights. A dense scatter plot of points positioned by genomic coordinates emphasizes additional data, annotated with size and color intensity related to expression values. The visual is styled with a dashed grid, light gray background, and varies the point colors within a warm color palette, enhancing the depiction of genomic relationships and structural features. The visualization is titled "Hi-C Matrix," with the subtitle "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations."
