This visualization presents a linear layout focusing on chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The chart contains an overlay alignment titled "IGV," illustrating genomic annotations using data from a BEDDB file. The tracks display gene names as text, rectangles for gene locations, and triangular patterns indicating strand direction, either left or right. The text and rectangles are colored in pink, and the strands are represented with white lines. Additionally, the arrangement is set vertically within a horizontal view to highlight categories based on gene strand, with '+' and '-' rows. The overall presentation employs a linear layout and utilizes hg38 assembly, providing a clear genomic range annotation along the x-axis.
