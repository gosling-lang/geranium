The visualization is an overlaid matrix layout featuring two matrix tracks, each displaying genomic data. Both matrices plot the genome along the x- and y-axes for chromosome 10, showcasing genomic intervals. The visual encoding is achieved through color intensity, with the first track colored using a pink gradient and the second using a hot color scheme. This dual-track arrangement allows for a comparative analysis of genomic data, with expression values prominently visualized. The layout is responsive, adapting to screen size, and includes legends indicating quantitative data ranges. The matrices are styled with full matrix extents, ensuring comprehensive data coverage.
