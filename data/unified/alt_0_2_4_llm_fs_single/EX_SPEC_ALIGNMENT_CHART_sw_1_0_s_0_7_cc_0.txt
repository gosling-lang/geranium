The visualization consists of two main sections, each with multiple charts displayed in a linear layout. The first section features a 'Gap' bar chart with green bars representing gaps between genomic positions, followed by a 'Conservation' bar chart showing conservation levels with a color gradient from yellow to orange. The third track aligns sequences, displaying colored rectangles and text for different categories across genomic positions, with black text indicating the sequence base.

The second section overlays three tracks: a chart of colored rectangles for base alignment, a conservation bar chart utilizing a color gradient, and a gap bar chart in green. These tracks display genomic intervals and are synchronized through a linking mechanism, allowing for detailed exploration within defined zoom limits. Overall, the visualization provides an interactive analysis of genomic data, offering insights into gaps, conservation, and base alignments with associated categorical data.
