The visualization is titled "Rule Mark" and contains a linear layout that overlays multiple tracks. The primary track is a bar chart, where genomic positions are plotted on the x-axis and quantitative expression levels are on the y-axis. The categories are aggregated into light gray bars.

Overlaid on this are two rule tracks featuring horizontal and vertical lines. The first rule track shows red lines, whose opacity and stroke width vary based on a quantitative dataset. The second rule track features blue lines with a constant stroke width. These annotations intersect the bars, adding contextual information relative to genomic position and value.

The chart visually encodes data related to genome assembly hg38, with annotations marking specific quantitative values. It uses a dashed line style throughout to emphasize annotation consistency. The visualization aims to provide a comprehensive view of genomic intervals with additional emphasis through annotative lines.
