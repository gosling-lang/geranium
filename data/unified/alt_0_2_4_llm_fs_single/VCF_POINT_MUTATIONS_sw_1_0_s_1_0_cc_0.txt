A scatter plot in a linear layout visualizes point mutations from a VCF file across the genome assembly hg38. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis represents a quantitative data field named 'DISTPREVLOGE.' Each point is color-coded based on mutation subtypes ('C>A', 'C>G', 'C>T', 'T>A', 'T>C', 'T>G'), creating a visual distinction using a consistent color palette. The plot's subtitle is "Point mutations from a VCF file," highlighting the type of data being represented.
