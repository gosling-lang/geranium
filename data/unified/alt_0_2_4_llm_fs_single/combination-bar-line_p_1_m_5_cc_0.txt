A vertical linear layout visualization of genomic data from chromosome 1 (positions 1 to 3,000,500) is shown. The top track is an overlay with area and point marks, highlighting genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis. It is stratified by categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4,' with each sample visualized in distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The bottom track also uses an area mark to display overlapping peak values of the samples. This visualization provides a comparative view of expression levels across different samples using multivec data.
