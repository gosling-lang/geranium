The visualization depicts genomic data using two sets of views, each focused on different regions on chromosomes 12 and 8. The charts consist of genomic range annotation tracks and stacked bar charts.

The top section's genomic range annotation highlights specific gene locations within chromosome 12 between 10,140,000 and 10,210,000. Multiple tracks overlay this range, represented by symbols like triangles and rectangles, indicating the strand direction and gene bounds.

Below this are three bar charts titled "Sample 1," "Sample 2," and "Sample 3." Each chart shows expression levels across genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression on the y-axis, color-coded in purple, sky blue, and green, respectively. These coincide with the same chromosomal region, offering a comparative view of expression data.

The bottom section mirrors this layout for chromosome 8 between 127,734,000 and 127,744,000, with similar genomic annotations. The accompanying bar charts again display data for "Sample 1," "Sample 2," and "Sample 3," but this time with green and pink bars, illustrating expression differences within this chromosome section.

The structure allows direct comparison of expression levels across different sample sets and genomic regions, using color and track alignment to facilitate insight into genetic features and variations.
