The visualization is a multi-row scatter plot in a linear layout, displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. It uses a multivec dataset with four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each represented by distinct colors. The x-axis represents genomic positions, and the y-axis denotes peak values, with the size of each point also indicating peak magnitude. The chart is stratified into four rows based on categories, with a transparency value applied to points for improved visibility. The visualization includes a tooltip feature providing details on position, peak values, and category for each point.
