A linear layout visualization displays sequence alignment using a BAM file, referencing chromosome 1 between positions 136,750 and 139,450. The top track is a bar chart depicting read coverage, where the height of each bar represents the number of reads, colored in silver. The bottom track, a pileup chart, stratifies reads into rows by type, with variations depicted in different colors. These include 'normal read', 'deletion (+-)', 'inversion (++/--)', 'duplication (-+)', 'more than two mates', 'mates not found within chromosome', and 'clipping.' The title of the visualization is 'Pileup Track Using BAM Data.'
