The visualization presents a linear ideogram of chromosome 1 from the hg38 genome assembly. The chart is titled "Basic Marks: Rect" with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples." It consists of a series of rectangles displaying genomic intervals along the x-axis. Each rectangle is colored according to different stain categories, such as gneg, gpos25, gpos50, gpos75, gpos100, and gvar. The color scheme includes shades of blue, orange, green, red, purple, and brown. The rectangles' boundaries are defined by the genomic start and end fields, and they are outlined in gray with a white stroke for contrast.
