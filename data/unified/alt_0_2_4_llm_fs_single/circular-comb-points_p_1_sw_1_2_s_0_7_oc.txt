A figure with two circular scatter plots visualizes genomic data spanning chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The left chart shows a scatter plot where points represent expression values categorized by sample. The size and position of the points on the y-axis are determined by the 'peak' data field. The colors denote different samples such as 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' The right chart arranges points in rows for each sample, with varying colors indicating categories. Both plots utilize a multivec file, and the overall layout is circular with a vertical arrangement centered at a 0.5 radius. This visualization leverages visual attributes like color and size to convey quantitative and categorical data efficiently.
