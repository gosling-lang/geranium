A circular view and a linear view are arranged vertically, linked by a blue interactive brush in the circular view. The circular view displays the entire genome with five tracks: an ideogram, a text annotation track titled "Putative Driver," two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" (blue rectangles) and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" (orange rectangles), and a line-connection track showing structural variations like 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion,' differentiated by color.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and includes similar tracks with additional ones. There's a genomic track displaying gene annotations, a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" with points representing the distance to previous mutations colored by subtype, and two range tracks for "Insertion" and "Deletion" with light and dark colors. A copy number variation track illustrates total CN values with gray bars. This visualization utilizes CSV, JSON, and VCF data, and employs different genomic transformations and filtering for detailed genetic analysis.
