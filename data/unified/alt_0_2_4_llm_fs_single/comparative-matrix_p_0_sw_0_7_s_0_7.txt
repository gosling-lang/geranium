A comparative genomic visualization using two overlaid matrix tracks is displayed. The visualization focuses on chromosome 10 and is arranged in a horizontal layout. The first track, represented in grey, uses a quantitative measure for color intensity to indicate genome expression, with genomic intervals on both x- and y-axes. The second track, distinguished by a pink color range, is overlaid on the first, also encoding expression values through color. This heatmap-style chart effectively visualizes the similarities and differences across genomic intervals, with an interactive feature allowing responsive size adjustments for wider displays. Linking IDs ensure that genomic domains remain synchronized within a larger multi-view setup.
