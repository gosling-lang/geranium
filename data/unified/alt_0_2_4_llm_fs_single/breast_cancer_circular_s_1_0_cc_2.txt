A circular visualization displays genomic data for the entire hg38 assembly. It includes four tracks: an ideogram colored by stain categories, two range annotation tracks for copy number variations of cancer data, and a link track for structural variants. The ideogram uses a range of colors to represent different stain categories. The first range annotation track shows genomic intervals with a minor copy number of zero, highlighted in pink. The second range annotation track indicates intervals with a total copy number in the tumor within a specific range, colored green. The link track connects genomic positions, with links represented in various colors and strokes to denote structural variant classes: 'tandem-duplication', 'translocation', 'deletion', and 'inversion.'
