A circular and linear genomic visualization, utilizing data from "hg19", illustrates various genomic attributes. The circular view encompasses ideograms, putative driver annotations, concentrated data on gains and losses of heterozygosity (LOH), and connections depicting structural variations. It links to a linear view focusing on chromosome 1 using an interactive brush. The linear view elaborates on genomic features with tracks for ideograms, annotated putative drivers, gene annotations, point mutations, insertions, deletions, and copy number variations. Tracks visually emphasize genomic connections using colors and graphical elements like triangles and lines, representing categories such as 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and inversions ('TtT' and 'HtH'). The tooltips additionally enhance this visualization by detailing genomic positions and related implications.
