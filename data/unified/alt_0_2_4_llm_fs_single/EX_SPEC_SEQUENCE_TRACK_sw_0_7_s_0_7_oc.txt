A vertical linear visualization displays genetic data on chromosome 1 from positions 3,000,000 to 3,000,010. The main view consists of an overlay bar chart where each bar's height indicates the quantitative value of the sequence counts, colored by base type ('A', 'T', 'G', 'C'). Text labels represent nucleotides, displayed in bold white font on colored backgrounds corresponding to each base type. A legend highlights color categories for easy identification of bases. The dataset is sourced from a multivec file, designed to dynamically filter out bars with zero count. Zoom levels adjust the text display, enhancing clarity and focus on significant data ranges.
