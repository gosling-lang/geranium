The visualization contains two vertically arranged tracks with a linear layout, focusing on chromosome 1 within the interval 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is an area chart representing genomic data, stratified by rows for categories named 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'. Each category is displayed in a different color: blue, orange, green, and red. The height and area reflect expression values encoded by the 'peak' data field. The bottom track is a line chart showing the same genomic interval with colored lines for each sample category, representing expression values. The color coding is maintained across both tracks, serving as legends to delineate each sample. Both tracks are equipped with tooltips for data exploration, allowing interaction with data points hovering over positions and values.
