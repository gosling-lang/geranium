The visualization is a stacked bar chart illustrating a multivec dataset across chromosome 12, specifically between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. Each bar, categorized by different samples (excluding "sample -"), represents the peak expression values along the corresponding genomic interval on the x-axis. The chart dynamically adjusts its layout based on height, using an interactive system to present data in different opacity levels and axes domains. The use of vibrant colors across various categories aids in distinguishing sample groups effectively. This visualization is designed to enhance graphical perception of multiple time series, highlighting varying expression levels across genomic positions.
