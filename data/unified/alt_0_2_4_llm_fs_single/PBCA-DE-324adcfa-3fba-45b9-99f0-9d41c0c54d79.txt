A circular and linear view are arranged vertically and linked by a blue interactive brush in the circular view. The circular view displays the entire hg19 genome with five tracks: an ideogram, annotations, and structural variations. The ideogram uses color-coded rectangles to indicate categories. Text annotations titled "Putative Driver" are stratified by rows and appear in black. Rectangular annotations highlight 'Gain' in sky blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange. Connections represent structural variants like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.'

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, featuring similar tracks plus a gene annotation track displaying genomic structures and their names, a scatterplot representing point mutations with variant colors, and copy number variants showcased via quantitative bars. The connections and categories are consistently color-coded across both views to indicate structural variations such as 'Deletion' and 'Inversion.'
