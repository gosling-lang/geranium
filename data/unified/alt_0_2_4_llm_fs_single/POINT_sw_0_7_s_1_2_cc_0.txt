A bubble chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, showing the entire genome of hg38. Points represent expression values with their position and size encoded by the data field 'peak.' The color of points is pink. The chart is titled 'Basic Marks: point' with a subtitle 'Tutorial Examples.' The x-axis displays genomic positions, while the y-axis reflects quantitative expression values.
