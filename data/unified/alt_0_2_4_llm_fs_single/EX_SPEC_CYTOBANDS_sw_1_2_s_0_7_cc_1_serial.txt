The visualization is a serial arrangement of genomic data tracks across chromosomes 1 to 5 in a linear layout. Each view consists of an area chart and an ideogram track. The area charts display multivec data for samples 1 to 4, encoded by different colors, with genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative values on the y-axis. The ideogram tracks feature text labels, rectangles, and triangles of varying colors to depict different chromosomal bands, density, and cytogenetic features. This static visualization utilizes hg38 assembly with spaced tracks, showcasing genomic intervals using both area and overlay designs.
