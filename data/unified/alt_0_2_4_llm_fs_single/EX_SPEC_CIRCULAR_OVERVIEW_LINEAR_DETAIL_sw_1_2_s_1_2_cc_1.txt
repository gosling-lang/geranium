A circular and linear visualization are arranged vertically. The top circular chart shows four genomic categories as concentric rings, with color-coded bars representing expression levels and connections illustrating rearrangements across various chromosomes. The colors used are blue, orange, green, and red. The circular chart is interactive, with blue and red brushes linking to two detailed linear views below. The two horizontal bar charts provide detailed views of the genomic regions on chromosomes 5 and 16, showing expression levels for different samples. The bars are color-coded similarly to the circular chart, maintaining the same category stratification.
