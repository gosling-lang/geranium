The visualization consists of three bar charts arranged horizontally. Each chart presents genomic data using a multivec file with bins of size 8. The charts depict different genomic intervals, with the first and third focusing on chromosome 12 and the second on chromosome 9, ranging from positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The y-axis represents quantitative measures of peaks, and each chart is color-coded differently: navy blue for the first chart, orange for the second, and dark yellow for the third. The configuration allows responsive resizing in width, with an adaptive layout switching to vertical if the width is under 1200 pixels. The visualization utilizes white strokes of 0.5 width around the bars for emphasis. All charts are in a linear layout with horizontal orientation and allow for interactive exploration through linking with ID '1'.
