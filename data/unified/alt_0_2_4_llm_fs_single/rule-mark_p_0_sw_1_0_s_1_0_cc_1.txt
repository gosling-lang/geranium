The visualization is a rule-marked bar chart overlaid with genomic data, presented in a linear layout. It represents data from a multivec JSON file and highlights specific genomic positions with horizontal and vertical dashed lines. The chart's x-axis displays genomic intervals, while the y-axis shows quantitative peak values. Bars are colored in purple, and additional sky-blue vertical lines annotate specific genomic positions, with varied stroke widths indicating different quantitative values. The visualization is titled "Rule Mark" with the subtitle "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines."
