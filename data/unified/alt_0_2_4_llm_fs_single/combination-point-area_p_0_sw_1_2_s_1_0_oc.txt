A dual-track linear visualization presents genomic data along chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track features a scatter plot with points representing expression values, encoded by size and color, across four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each category is color-coded and indexed in the legend. The bottom track is an area chart, stratified by rows for each sample category. It showcases expression values through areas filled with corresponding category colors. Tooltips provide additional genomic details such as start and end positions for both tracks. The visualization uses a linear layout and is based on the 'hg38' assembly.
