The visualization is a scatter plot in a linear layout, displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. Each point represents the peak values of samples, with the x-axis showing genomic positions and the y-axis indicating quantitative peak values. Points vary in size based on their peak values and are colored to represent four different samples, including 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Colors are displayed using a palette of blue, orange, green, and red. The opacity of the points is set to 0.5. Tooltip information includes start and end genomic positions, peak value, and sample group.
