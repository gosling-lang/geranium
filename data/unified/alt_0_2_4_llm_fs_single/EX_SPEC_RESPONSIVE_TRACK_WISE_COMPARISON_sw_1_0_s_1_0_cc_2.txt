The visualization consists of eight charts arranged vertically. It features two genomic range annotation tracks with text labels and six bar charts displaying genomic data.

1. **Genomic Range Annotation Tracks**: 
   - The tracks display gene annotations on chromosomes 12 and 8 with features such as genes and exons indicated by right and left triangles, lines, and rectangles. The chromosome 12 track uses a purple color scheme, while the chromosome 8 track uses pink.
   - Triangles represent the gene direction (right for positive, left for negative strand), with gene names labeled in white-stroked text.
   - Exons are depicted as filled rectangles.

2. **Bar Charts**:
   - There are six bar charts, labeled "Sample 1," "Sample 2," and "Sample 3" for each chromosome.
   - Chromosome 12 charts have bars colored in pink and green for samples, with peaks representing quantitative data (e.g., expression values).
   - Chromosome 8 charts display bars in purple, pink, and sky blue.
   - In all charts, the x-axis represents genomic intervals, and the y-axis shows quantitative values as bar heights.

Links between views are established through the genomic alignment, ensuring that interacting with data on one chromosome reflects on the other. The visualization uses a blend of colors and interactive elements while maintaining unified styling for consistency across all tracks.
