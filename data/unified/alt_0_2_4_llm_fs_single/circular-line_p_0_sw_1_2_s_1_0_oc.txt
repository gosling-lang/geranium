The visualization is a circular chart displaying genomic data for chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. It features an overlay of line and scatter plots where each line and corresponding points represent different samples ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'). The x-axis represents genomic positions, and the y-axis represents quantitative peak values. Points vary in size according to peak values, with categories indicated by colors: yellow, green, blue, and pink. The layout is static with a vertical arrangement and a center radius of 0.5. The data is sourced from a multivec file, with sample-specific data transformed and displayed using lines and points. The chart includes tooltips for detailed data values for position, peaks, and samples. The design is suitable for genomic data visualization at high-level genome intervals, emphasizing sample differentiation through color and size encodings.
