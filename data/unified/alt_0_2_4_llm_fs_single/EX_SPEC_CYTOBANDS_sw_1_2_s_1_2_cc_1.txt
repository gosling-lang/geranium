The visualization displays parallel linear tracks for chromosomes 1 to 5 using the hg38 assembly. Each track features an area chart and an ideogram. The area charts visualize genomic coordinates on the x-axis and quantitative expression values on the y-axis, colored by categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4,' in shades of blue, orange, green, and red. The ideograms are overlaid with text and symbols, including rectangles colored for density (white to black) and maroon triangles indicating acentric regions. The arrangement highlights detailed genomic structures, with smooth transitions and interactions such as filtering different chromosomal stains. The visualization utilizes multivec files and integrates data from cytogenetic band CSVs to provide a comprehensive genomic overview.
