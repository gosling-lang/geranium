The figure consists of two circular charts positioned side by side. The left chart is a circular bar chart displaying genomic data from chromosome 1 within the interval [1, 3,000,500], using rows to differentiate categories such as 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'. Each sample is represented by bars, with distinct colors for each category, including blue, orange, green, and red. The right chart is a circular heatmap encoding the same genomic interval. It uses color intensity to represent expression values, with a color range from light yellow to dark orange to indicate varying intensities. Both charts are stratified by rows and utilize tooltips for detailed data interaction.
