A circular genomic visualization displaying two horizontally arranged tracks focuses on chromosome 1, covering positions 1 to 3,000,500. The left track features a circular area chart where genomic data is represented by distinct colored areas for each sample ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'), highlighting differences in expression values. The right track showcases circular connections between genome sites, with each link colored based on starting positions on the genome, illustrating potential relationships or similarities between genomic regions.
