A titled visualization, "Visual Linking," consists of multiple linked views. The primary chart is a scatter plot with a linear layout showing genomic positions on chromosome 1 ranging from 160,000,000 to 200,000,000. The points are colored according to categories 'sample 1' through 'sample 4.' Below it, there is a circular line chart and an area chart juxtaposed horizontally. The circular chart illustrates the chromosomeâ€™s full range in radial lines, highlighting the interval selected by a brush tool. The adjacent linear area chart visualizes peaks across the same categories, with a brush tool for interactive zooming and linking back to the scatter plot above. The subtitle indicates that adjusting these brushes updates the views, enhancing interactive exploration.
