This visualization consists of a circular view and a linear view, linked by a blue interactive brush in the circular view. The circular view shows the entire genome, using an ideogram and multiple annotation tracks. The ideogram displays chromosomal bands with colors representing different stains. Text annotations indicate putative driver genes. Two range annotation tracks visualize 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in blue and orange rectangles, respectively. The line-connection track represents structural variations with different colors for types such as 'Duplication' and 'Inversion.'

The linear view provides a detailed look at chromosome 1. It features similar tracks to the circular view, including a gene annotation track displaying gene structures as gray triangles and rectangles. A track titled 'Point Mutation' is a scatter plot showing genomic mutations with point colors indicating mutation subtypes. Additional range annotation tracks include 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' visualized with rectangles in varying colors, and a 'Copy Number Variants' track showing bars that represent quantitative values. The x-axis intervals span from one chromosome band to another, with additional tooltip information available on hover.
