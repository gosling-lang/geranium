The visualization is a line chart in a linear layout that represents a multivec file, showcasing the entire genome of hg38. The positions are plotted on the x-axis as genomic coordinates, while the y-axis represents the 'peak' values as a quantitative measure. The lines, which are colored in purple, vary in thickness according to the data field, with a static size value of 2. The title of the chart is 'Basic Marks: line,' and it falls under the subtitle 'Tutorial Examples.'
