A circular bar chart visualizes multivec data from chromosome 12, spanning regions between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000 base pairs. The data is displayed in concentric rows representing different samples, with bar heights encoding quantitative 'peak' values. The chart employs a gradient color scheme to differentiate samples, and visibility varies based on track height. Tracks transition to a linear layout for an aspect ratio greater than 1.5, highlighting responsiveness for various viewing dimensions. This visualization references Javed et al.'s work on graphical perception of multiple time series.
