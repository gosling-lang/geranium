A circular visualization depicting genomic data from chromosome 1, utilizing a multivec file to render area marks representing peak values. The layout, with a center radius of 0.6, displays four sample categories distinguished by color. An ideogram track beneath uses data from a CSV file, filtered to exclude centromeric stains (acen), illustrating chromosomal regions with different shades, signifying various band types. The visualization combines detailed area graphs with a chromosomal ideogram, providing insights into genomic features and variations.
