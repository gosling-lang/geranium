The visualization consists of two circular tracks within a unified layout, focusing on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The left track is a circular heat map that depicts genomic intervals on the x-axis, with color intensity indicating expression values. It is organized into rows corresponding to four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The right track features a circular bar chart where the genomic position is on the x-axis and peak values are displayed on the y-axis as bars. Each bar is colored based on sample categories, allowing for visual differentiation across categories. The visualization leverages the 'multivec' data type, employing both rectangular and bar marks to represent quantitative data fields.
