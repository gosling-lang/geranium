The visualization comprises a circular and a linear view linked by an interactive blue brush in the circular view. The circular view displays the entire hg19 genome, featuring tracks like an ideogram, text annotations titled "Putative Driver," genomic ranges for "Gain" in blue and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in orange, and connection lines indicating structural variations such as translocations, duplications, deletions, and inversions. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, mirroring tracks from the circular view while adding a gene track, scatter plot for "Point Mutation" with VCF data, and additional range annotations for insertions and deletions. Rectangles in the "Copy Number Variants" track are light grey, indicating quantitative data. Color and stroke variations visually distinguish categories like gain, LOH, and different structural variations, enhancing the interpretability of genetic alterations.
