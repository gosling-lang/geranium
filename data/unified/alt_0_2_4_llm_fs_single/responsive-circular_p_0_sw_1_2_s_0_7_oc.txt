A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. It features multiple tracks with genomic data segmented by samples. The tracks are organized in rows, with each row representing different samples. The height of bars corresponds to peak expression values. The bars are colored according to the sample categories, which include up to 16 distinct samples. The color differentiation allows for easy distinction between the samples. The circular layout adapts to the aspect ratio and switches to linear if required, ensuring optimal display across varying conditions. This visualization is part of a study referenced by Javed et al. on graphical perception in multiple time series analysis.
