A linear visualization of genomic data from chromosome 1, within an interval of 1 to 3,000,500, displays two scatter plots stacked vertically. The top chart presents a unified view where expression values for four samples ('sample 1' to 'sample 4') are shown as points, with positions on the chromosome mapped to the x-axis and 'peak' values to the y-axis. These points vary in size and transparency (opacity 0.5) according to the 'peak' values, and are color-coded by sample category, enhancing visual differentiation.

The bottom track is another scatter plot, differing in its stratified layout by sample category. This arrangement allows for clearer comparison across samples. Both plots support detailed exploration via tooltip information, providing genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample identifiers. This visualization uses a multivec data file, enhancing insights into genomic expression patterns across the specified region.
