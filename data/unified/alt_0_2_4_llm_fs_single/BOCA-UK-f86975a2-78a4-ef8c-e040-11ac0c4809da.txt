A circular and linear view are vertically arranged, connected by an interactive blue brush on the circular view. The circular section displays the full genome in an ideogram with five tracks. It includes a point annotation track, two range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' and 'LOH' (Loss of Heterozygosity), and a line-connection track. The range tracks depict genomic intervals in blue and red, while the line-connection track uses various colors to show categories like 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' etc. Each category is represented by different colored connections and strokes.

The interconnected linear view focuses on chromosome 1, revealing nine tracks with additional elements like a gene annotation track, a scatterplot, and range tracks visualizing insertion and deletion mutations. The scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation' maps positions to previous mutation distances and categorizes them by color. The 'Copy Number Variants' range track highlights variations using gray rectangles. This visualization comprehensively illustrates complex genomic data for enhanced interactive analysis.
