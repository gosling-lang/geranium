A circular line chart in a circular layout visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The lines represent data for different samples, using distinct colors for each sample in the categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 6', 'sample 7', and 'sample 8'. The y-axis indicates expression values with a peak value range from 0 to 0.01. The inner to outer lines demonstrate multiple layers for each sample, illustrating a genomic range with smooth transitions between peaks and valleys. The visualization is encoded over a large circular layout with dimensions 1600x1600 pixels.
