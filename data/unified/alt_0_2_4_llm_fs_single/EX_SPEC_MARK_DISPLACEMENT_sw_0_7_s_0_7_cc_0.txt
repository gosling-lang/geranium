A visualization titled "Mark Displacement" demonstrates the repositioning of marks to address visual overlaps using displacement options. The genomic data from chromosomes 3, 2, and 17 is displayed across multiple tracks. 

1. **Track 1 - Genomic Range Annotation:**
   - **Title:** "hg38 | Transcript (Max. 15 Rows)"
   - **Content:** Displays transcripts from chromosome 3 between positions 142,500,000 and 143,000,000. 
   - **Marks:** Includes right-facing triangles for genes on the '+' strand, left-facing triangles for '-' strands, text labels for gene names, rules, and rectangles for exons. 
   - **Displacement:** Piling method to organize overlapping features into a maximum of 15 rows.

2. **Track 2 - Genomic Position Annotation:**
   - **Title:** "Likely Benign"
   - **Content:** Depicts likely benign variants from chromosome 2, interval 126,800,000 to 127,700,000.
   - **Marks:** Contains points, text, and connections. Points are colored green, and accompanying text is colored according to specific base categories.
   - **Links:** Features pink connection lines between genomic positions.

3. **Additional Track on Chromosome 17:**
   - This track illustrates various pathogenicity-related points using a color spectrum to indicate significance, spanning positions 43,080,000 to 43,120,
