A circular scatter plot visualizes multivec data across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 in a genomic interval. The layout is stratified into four rows, each representing 'sample 1' through 'sample 4,' distinguished by color: yellow, green, blue, and pink, respectively. Each data point's position on the circular x-axis corresponds to its genomic location, while the y-axis and size reflect expression values. The transparency of the points is set to 50%, enhancing the layered appearance. Tooltips provide detailed information, including start and end genomic positions, peak values, and sample names.
