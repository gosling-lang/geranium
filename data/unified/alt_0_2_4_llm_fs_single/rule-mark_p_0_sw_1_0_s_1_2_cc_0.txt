A linear bar chart visualizes a multivec data file with genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression levels on the y-axis, colored in sky blue. Overlaid on this are horizontal and vertical dashed lines. The horizontal lines in pink represent quantitative values from a JSON dataset. Vertical lines in green are also from the JSON dataset, indicating genomic positions. The visualization includes an annotation with the title "Rule Mark" and the subtitle "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines."
