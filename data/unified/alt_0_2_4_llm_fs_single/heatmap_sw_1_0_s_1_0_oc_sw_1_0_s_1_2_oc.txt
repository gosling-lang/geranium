The visualization is a heat map titled "HFFc6_Micro-C" set in a linear layout that represents interaction data using a matrix file. This chart displays the entire genome (hg38 assembly) along both axes. Each axis is scaled genomically without visible labels. Color intensity, ranging from cooler to warmer hues, encodes the quantitative expression values, illustrating genomic interactions with varying intensity. The chart's dimensions are 720x720, indicating a detailed presentation suitable for extensive genomic datasets.
