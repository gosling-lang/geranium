The visualization is a scatter plot with a linear layout, displaying genomic information from a multivec file for the hg38 assembly. The x-axis represents genomic positions labeled as chromosome names, while the y-axis indicates quantitative expression values. Each point's size reflects its peak value, and is uniformly colored purple. The chart is titled 'Basic Marks: point' with a subtitle 'Tutorial Examples'. The scatter plot captures data for 'sample 1', visualized over the entire genome within a fixed width of 800 pixels and a height of 210 pixels.
