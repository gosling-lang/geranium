A visualization of two overlaid heatmaps arranged in a horizontal layout, representing genomic data from chromosome 10. The x-axis and y-axis both show genomic intervals with the top axis indicating 'xs' and 'xe,' and the left axis indicating 'ys' and 'ye.' Colors encode quantitative expression values, with shades of grey for the lower-left matrix and shades of pink for the upper-right matrix. The overlay alignment is used to combine multiple tracks, demonstrating expression levels within specified genomic regions. The chart is responsive to view width, adapting the visualization accordingly.
