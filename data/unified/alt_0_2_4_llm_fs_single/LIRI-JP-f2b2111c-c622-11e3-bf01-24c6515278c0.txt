The visualization features a comprehensive multi-track display integrating both circular and linear genomic views. The circular view encompasses the entire genome of hg19 and consists of six tracks: an ideogram with category-colored rectangles, a text-annotated ‘Putative Driver’ track, and several range annotation tracks displaying data such as 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH).' These are colored in sky blue and dark orange respectively, with a connection track visualizing genomic relationships using curved links in various colors and styles to denote categories like 'Translocation' and 'Deletion.'

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and includes an ideogram, a genomic text track presenting driver mutations with specific styling, and a point mutation scatter plot where positions indicate mutation distances. This plot, titled 'Point Mutation,' uses distinct colors for mutation subtypes, enhancing data clarity. Additional tracks include an indel plot with insertions and deletions, colored yellow and green, and a 'Copy Number Variants' track showcasing quantitative data in gray bars. The interactive brush tool in the circular view links both views, providing an intuitive exploration of detailed genomic regions.
