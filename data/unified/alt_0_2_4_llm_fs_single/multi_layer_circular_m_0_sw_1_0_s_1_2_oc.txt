The circular visualization represents a genomic scatter plot, focusing on chromosome 12 from positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. Multiple rows depict the samples categorized by colors, illustrating the expression values as discrete points. Each track varies in opacity and displays expression peaks across different quantitative domains. The layout facilitates easy identification of patterns and variations, enabling comparative analysis of 16 sample categories with distinct visual encodings, like color and opacity, to denote variations in data ranges. This representation is based on data visualization principles from Javed et al.'s study on graphical perception of multiple time series.
