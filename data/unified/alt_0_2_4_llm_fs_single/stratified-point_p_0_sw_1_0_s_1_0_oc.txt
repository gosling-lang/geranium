The visualization is a linear scatter plot of genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. Each row represents a distinct sample ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'), visualized with points colored by sample. The y-axis indicates quantitative expression values, while point size denotes specific data peaks. The opacity of points is adjusted to 0.5 for better visualization. Tooltips provide detailed information including start and end positions, peak values, and sample names. This interactive chart allows for an in-depth examination of genomic variations across multiple samples.
