The visualization is a circular bar chart displaying a multivec file for chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. It employs a circular layout sectioned by rows, each representing different samples. Bars indicate expression levels, stratified by quantitative peaks across multiple thresholds, with opacity changes to denote different value ranges. Colors differentiate categories and enhance visual stratification, with no legends displayed. This reference is from "Graphical perception of Multiple Time Series" by Javed et al.
