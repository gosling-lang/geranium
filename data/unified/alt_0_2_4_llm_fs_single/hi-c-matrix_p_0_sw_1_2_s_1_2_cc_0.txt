The visualization titled "Hi-C Matrix" depicts Hi-C data in a linear layout. It includes multiple overlaid tracks, highlighting interactions in the genome.

1. **Matrix Track:** Displays the genome along both axes, showing chromosomal intervals with color intensity representing interaction values. The color scheme is a gradient from light to dark brown.

2. **Vertical and Horizontal Lines:** Annotations in the form of green vertical lines and purple horizontal lines mark specific genomic positions from a JSON data source.

3. **Annotated Matrix:** Features additional data points, represented by blue sky-colored points, indicating specific interaction values marked by size, overlaid with white outlines.

The genomic interval displayed is between positions 800,000,000 and 1,800,000,000, covering chromosomes including chr5 through chr10. Additional annotations provide visual cues using categorical strokes and data-driven color encoding, enhancing the comprehension of complex genome interactions.
