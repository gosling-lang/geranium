The visualization is a Hi-C contact matrix with an overlaid linear layout, spanning genomic intervals from 800 million to 1.8 billion base pairs. The matrix, presented in a 600x600 layout, visualizes chromosomal contacts where the x- and y-axes represent genomic positions. Data intensities are encoded using a gradient color scale, ranging from light to dark hues indicating interaction strength.

Overlaid are various annotations: vertical and horizontal pink lines highlight specific genomic coordinates, while bars and points provide additional insights into genomic features and values. Bars vary in color intensity according to quantitative data, while points—colored in sky blue—show genomic positions with sizes reflecting quantitative values. The visualization is interactive, with dashed lines denoting matrix divisions, aiding in clear distinction of genomic intervals. The title “Hi-C Matrix” is complemented by the subtitle “Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations,” encapsulating the purpose of detailed genomic data exploration.
