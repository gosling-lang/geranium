Here's a detailed description for the visualization:

---

The visualization titled "Visual Linking" demonstrates a multi-view representation of genomic data for chromosome 1. It features a circular and linear arrangement, allowing for interactive exploration.

**Circular View**: The circular chart displays genomic intervals on the x-axis, with peaks shown on the y-axis. It is stratified into rows based on samples 1 to 4, with colors indicating the categories: blue, orange, green, and red. This view includes an interactive brush that links to other charts, enabling the adjustment of the position and range displayed.

**Linear Views**: 
- The top linear bar chart also represents the entire chromosome 1, with bars displaying expression values. Like its circular counterpart, it is stratified by rows, with color-coded categories matching those in the circular view. An interactive brush links this chart to the detailed view below.
- The bottom linear chart focuses on a detailed genomic region from 160,000,000 to 200,000,000 on chromosome 1. It retains the row stratification and color scheme, allowing for specific inspection of peak expressions within this interval.

Together, these views provide a comprehensive and dynamic means of examining genomic data across different scales and formats, with visual links allowing for seamless navigation between summary and detailed insights.
