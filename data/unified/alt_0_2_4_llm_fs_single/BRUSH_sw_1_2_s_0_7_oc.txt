A pair of linked line charts depict genomic data using a multivec file. The upper track displays a genomic overview line chart across chromosome 1, set to hg38 assembly, where the y-axis represents quantitative values of 'peak.' A brush interaction highlights a specific region, linking to a more detailed view in the lower chart. The lower chart, titled 'Example: Brushing and Linking,' zooms into the region between positions 200,000,000 and 220,000,000. Both tracks employ a linear layout with an interactive brush colored in steel blue for navigation.
