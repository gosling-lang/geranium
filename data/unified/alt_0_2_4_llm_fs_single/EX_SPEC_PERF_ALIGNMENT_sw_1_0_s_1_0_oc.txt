The visualization, titled "Smoother Zoom," demonstrates two different approaches to genomic data display. The top chart, "New Approach: Stretching Tiles," and the bottom chart, "Original Approach," both display genomic sequences using colored rectangles representing different base types. Each chart is stratified into rows labeled by category names, with black text annotations. The x-axis shows genomic intervals from position 350 to 396. Colors are assigned to different base types, and a smoother zoom interaction is applied to enhance visibility without redrawing elements, focusing on efficient graphical scaling.
