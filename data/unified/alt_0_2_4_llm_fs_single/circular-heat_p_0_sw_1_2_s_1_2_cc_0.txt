The circular heatmap visualizes genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500, using a multivec dataset. The layout is circular, with four categories stratified by rows: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each segment represents a genomic interval, colored by the intensity of expression values, with a continuous color scale from light to dark representing the quantitative 'peak' values. The inner and outer radii of the circular layout create a dynamic representation of genomic data on a circular axis. The title is "Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts" with a subtitle "Heatmap".
