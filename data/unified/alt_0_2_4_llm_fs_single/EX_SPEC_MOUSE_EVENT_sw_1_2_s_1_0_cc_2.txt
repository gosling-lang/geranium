A set of interactive genomic visualizations in a linear layout, titled "Custom Mouse Events," demonstrates various bar and genomic annotation charts. The featured visualizations explore mouse hover and range selection interactions. The first three bar charts, titled "Individual Marks," "Group Marks By Sample," and "Group Marks By Genomic Position," display data along chromosome 1, using distinct colors for samples. An additional track "Group Marks By Gene" covers part of chromosome 3, illustrating gene annotations with arrows, while "Group Marks By Chromosome" offers an ideogram view, representing chromosomes 1 to 5 with text, rectangles, and triangles in diverse colors. Each chart integrates customized mouse events for interactive exploration.
