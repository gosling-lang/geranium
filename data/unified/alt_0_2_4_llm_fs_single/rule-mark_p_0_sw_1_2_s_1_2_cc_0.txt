**Description**: 

A layered visualization displaying genomic data using bars and rules. The background is set with a dashed style. 

- **Bar Chart**: 
  - Depicts genomic intervals on the x-axis.
  - Y-axis shows expression values capped at 0.003.
  - Bars are colored in light purple (#b59bf2).

- **Rule Marks**: 
  - Horizontal and vertical lines cross the chart.
  - First rule set uses quantitative strokeWidth based on 'v' values plotted against genomic x-axis, colored in light purple (#b59bf2).
  - Second rule set shows vertical lines with a constant strokeWidth of 2, colored in green (#85B348).

- **Overall Layout**:
  - Linear orientation with a horizontal layout.
  - Designed for the hg38 genome assembly.
  - Provides clear genomic annotations with overlaid tracks for data clarity.

The title "Rule Mark" with the subtitle "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines" describes its purpose.
