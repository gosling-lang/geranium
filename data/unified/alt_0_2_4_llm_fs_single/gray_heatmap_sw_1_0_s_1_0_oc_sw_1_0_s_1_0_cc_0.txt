A heat map in a linear layout shows a matrix file representing the hg38 genome assembly. Genomic intervals on both the x-axis (chromosome start) and y-axis (chromosome end) are encoded with color intensity reflecting quantitative values. The visualization is static with rectangular marks and employs a "hot" color range to depict expression values, revealing patterns along the diagonal that highlight chromosomal interactions. The visualization has a width and height of 430 units each.
