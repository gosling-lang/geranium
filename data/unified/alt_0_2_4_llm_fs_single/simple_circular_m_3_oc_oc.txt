A circular visualization depicting genomic data from various samples using a multivec file, aligned with the hg38 assembly. The layout consists of two tracks: a circular bar chart displaying data for chromosome 1, with colors indicating different categories, and a circular ideogram track showcasing genomic intervals using different shades to represent categories like 'gneg', 'gpos25', and others. The bar chart encodes expression values on the y-axis, while genomic positions form the x-axis, linked by a top axis. The ideogram uses a gray stroke to outline intervals, positioned below the bar chart, creating a layered look.
