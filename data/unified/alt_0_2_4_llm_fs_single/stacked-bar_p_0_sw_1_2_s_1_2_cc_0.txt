The visualization is a linear, vertical bar chart representing genomic data from chromosome 1, within the interval from 1 to 3,000,500. It displays multivec data with peaks of expression values plotted on the y-axis, and genomic positions on the x-axis. The bars are colored to indicate four different categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each represented by distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The interactive chart includes a top x-axis showing genomic intervals and a y-axis with quantitative values, accompanied by a legend for category identification. Tooltips provide additional genomic and sample details.
