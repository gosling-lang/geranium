The visualization depicts a circular and a linear view of genomic data from the hg19 assembly, arranged vertically. The circular view includes five tracks: an ideogram, a text annotation track, two range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in blue and orange respectively, and a line-connection track showing structural variations with lines in various colors representing categories like 'Duplication', 'Translocation', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion'. The circular view, linked to the linear view with an interactive blue brush, covers the entire genome.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, featuring multiple tracks: ideograms, 'Putative Driver' text annotations, gene annotations, point mutations in a scatter plot, and tracks for insertions and deletions. The scatter plot reveals point mutations with colors indicating subtypes like 'C>A', 'C>G', 'C>T', etc. Additionally, tracks labeled 'Copy Number Variants' visualize data in grey bars, while 'Gain' and 'LOH' are shown in blue and orange.

The design uses an elliptical link style for connections in the linear and circular views, providing comprehensive insights into genomic variations across a substantial genomic region.
