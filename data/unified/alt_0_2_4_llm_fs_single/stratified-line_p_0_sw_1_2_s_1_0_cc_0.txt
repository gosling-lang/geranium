A linear layout visualization showcases multivec data across chromosome 1, from position 1 to 3,000,500. It is stratified by four nominal rows labeled 'sample 1' through 'sample 4.' Each sample is displayed with a unique color: blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The visualization includes a combination of line and scatter plot elements. Line charts illustrate the quantitative 'peak' values on the y-axis, while scatter plot points, scaled by the 'peak' values, emphasize key data points. The x-axis displays genomic positions. Tooltip features provide additional insights by showing positions, peak values, and sample names. The visualization offers a comprehensive view of sample-specific genomic data.
