A visual representation comprising a circular and a linear view showcases genomic data related to the human genome hg19 assembly. The circular view displays an entire ideogram annotated with distinct colors and tracks, featuring 'Gain' in sky blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in dark orange. It includes connections representing structural variations such as Translocation, Duplication, Deletion, and Inversions. An interactive brush links the circular and linear views. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, highlighting regions with various annotations. These include 'Putative Driver' text annotations, 'Point Mutation' scatter plots with different mutation subtypes, as well as 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' tracks. Additional tracks display 'Copy Number Variants' using gray rectangles. The arrangement allows for an in-depth inspection of genomic alterations.
