A linear genomic position annotation track showcases gene annotations using right and left triangles to represent genomic strands. The visualization is titled "Basic Marks: Triangles" and subtitled "Tutorial Examples." It displays data from a BEDDB file over a genomic axis marked with chromosome numbers. Right-pointing blue triangles indicate the positive strand, while left-pointing red triangles denote the negative strand. Each triangle has an opacity of 0.8 and a size of 15, with rows stratified by strand categories. The chart spans a width of 800 and a height of 100.
