A visualization with two tracks in a linear layout shows genomic data for chromosome 1, ranging from 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. The top track is a bar chart representing the expression levels for four categories ('sample 1' to 'sample 4') using colored bars and stratification by rows. The bottom track is a heat map, displaying expression values as color intensity across genomic intervals, also stratified by rows for the same categories. Both tracks employ a multivec data source and feature tooltips for detailed data exploration.
