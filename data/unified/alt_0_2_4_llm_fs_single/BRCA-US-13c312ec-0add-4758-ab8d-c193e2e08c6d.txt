A visualization featuring a circular and linear layout showcases genomic data from hg19. The circular view displays an ideogram and various genomic tracks, including annotation and connection tracks, spanning the entire genome. Interactive brushing links to a detailed linear view of chromosome 1. This linear section includes tracks for "Putative Driver," "Point Mutation," "Copy Number Variants," with data visually represented using rectangles and points. The circular layout highlights genetic events like 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' while different structural variations are indicated by lines in distinct colors reflecting categories such as 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.'
