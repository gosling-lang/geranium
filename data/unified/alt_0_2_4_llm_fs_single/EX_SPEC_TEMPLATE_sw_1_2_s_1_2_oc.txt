A linear layout visualization using Gosling.js templates includes three tracks with genomic data. The first track is a gene annotation track showing regions on chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. Gene orientations are depicted with gray triangles and rectangles, representing different strands. The second track visualizes a sequence alignment on chromosome 1 ranging from position 77,925,299 to 77,925,320. It uses colored bars for bases A, T, G, and C. The third track is an ideogram of chromosome 1, displaying cytogenetic bands with stain colors. The title is “Track Template In Gosling.js,” and the subtitle explains the use of track templates in creating complex visualizations.
