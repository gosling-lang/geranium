The visualization titled "Visual Linking" presents a vertically arranged layout featuring linked genomic views. The top linear scatter plot shows chromosome 1 from 160,000,000 to 200,000,000. Data categories 'sample 1' through 'sample 4' are color-coded in orange, green, blue, and pink. The lower section comprises a linear area chart and a circular line chart, both displaying chromosome 1. The linear chart features genomic intervals with a brush tool linking to the scatter plot, highlighting data ranges. The circular chart uses lines to denote quantitative expression values. The brush interaction allows for dynamic updates, showcasing detailed views within the range selected.
