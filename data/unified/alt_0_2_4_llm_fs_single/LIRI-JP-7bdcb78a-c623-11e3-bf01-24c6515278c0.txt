The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view linked by a brush interaction. The circular view includes five tracks, showing an ideogram, text annotations, range annotations for 'Gain' in blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange, and connections indicating structural variations. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and includes additional tracks such as gene annotations, a scatter plot for 'Point Mutation,' and annotations for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion.' The scatter plot uses color to distinguish mutation subtypes. The line-connection tracks in both views use colors to differentiate between structural variations like 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' and 'Inversion,' providing a complex genomic overview.
