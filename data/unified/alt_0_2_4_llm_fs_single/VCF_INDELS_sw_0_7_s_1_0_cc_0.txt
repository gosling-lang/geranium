The visualization is a horizontal, linear track depicting insertions and deletions from a VCF file. Each genomic position on the x-axis is marked with colored rectangles, where orange represents insertions and green represents deletions. The visualization uses data from a VCF file, with rows categorizing the type of mutation. The view is overlayed with text labels indicating the mutation type, displayed in white on top of rectangles. The style has a light gray background, emphasizing genetic variations across different chromosomes. The subtitle, “Insertions and deletions from a VCF file,” provides context for the data being presented.
