The visualization titled "Example: Semantic Zooming" showcases a genomic data overview with semantic zooming capabilities. It uses a multivec file to display the distribution of base pairs across genomic positions. Base pairs 'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C' are represented in a linear layout, each marked by distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. When zoomed in, bold white text annotates these base pairs. This representation includes an overlay of bar and text marks, offering a detailed view of the count of each base, enhancing interactivity by dynamically displaying text annotations based on zoom level. The subtitle emphasizes the visibility of text marks during zoom navigation, offering an intuitive data exploration experience.
