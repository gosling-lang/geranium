A circular connection chart visualizes genomic data on chromosome 1 between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. Link connections are displayed in multiple colors, representing different nominal categories based on the starting position 's1'. The visualization spans a genomic interval from 1 to 3,000,500 on chromosome 1. The chart uses translucent colored strokes with an opacity of 0.2 and black outlines to indicate categorical variations. This circular layout is centered around a radius of 0.5, providing a concise view of genomic relationships within the specified range.
