The visualization is a genomic position annotation track titled "Basic Marks: Triangles." It features a linear layout representing the entire genome on the x-axis, with different chromosomes labeled at the top. The chart is categorized into two rows based on the strand direction: "+" and "-". The "+" strand is visualized with right-facing blue triangles at the gene end positions, while the "-" strand is represented with left-facing orange triangles at the gene start positions. The triangles are sized uniformly, and the visualization utilizes beddb data, focusing on strand and name fields. The rows are colored accordingly and exhibit partial transparency to enhance visual clarity. The subtitle is "Tutorial Examples."
