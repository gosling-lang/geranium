The visualization consists of two vertically arranged charts in a linear layout, representing genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500 on the hg38 assembly. The top chart is a multi-row bar chart encoding expression values for samples 1 to 4. Each row is a separate sample, color-coded in blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis shows expression values.

The bottom chart is a heat map displaying the same genomic range. It encodes expression values through color intensity, following a 'hot' color range. Similar to the bar chart, the heat map is stratified by sample rows, with each row representing a different sample. Both charts provide a tooltip function detailing start and end positions, expression values, and sample information for precise data inspection.
