The visualization is composed of two main views arranged vertically: a circular view and a linear view, both depicting genomic data of hg19. The circular view features an ideogram track, a text annotation track titled "Putative Driver," two bar annotation tracks labeled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and a connection track showing interactions between genomic regions. The bar tracks use colors such as sky blue and dark orange to indicate different genomic states. 

The linear view corresponds to chromosome 1 from the circular view, featuring tracks for the ideogram, text annotations, and genomic range annotations. It includes a scatterplot titled "Point Mutation" representing VCF data, with points colored by mutation type, and additional alignment tracks presenting insertion and deletion rows. The copy number variant track displays "Gain" and "LOH" as bars, visually connecting to the circular representation via a blue interactive brush, facilitating cross-reference between the two views.
