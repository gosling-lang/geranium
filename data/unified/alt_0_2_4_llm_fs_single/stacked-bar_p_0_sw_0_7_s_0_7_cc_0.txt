A linear bar chart displays multivec data for chromosome 1, covering the interval from 1 to 3,000,500. Four samples—'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'—are plotted with different colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis shows quantitative expression values. The chart includes a color legend and a tooltip highlighting start and end positions, peak values, and sample identifiers. The layout is vertical, maximizing visibility of genomic range on hg38 assembly.
