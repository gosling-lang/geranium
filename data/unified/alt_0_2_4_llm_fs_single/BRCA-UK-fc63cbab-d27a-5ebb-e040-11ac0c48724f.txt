The visualization consists of a circular view and a linear view arranged vertically, linked by a blue interactive brush. The circular view displays the entire genome, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. The circular view features an ideogram, a point annotation track titled "Putative Driver," and two range annotation tracks: "Gain" in blue rectangles and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in orange rectangles. It also includes a line-connection track that indicates structural variations like translocation and duplication, with lines colored based on categories such as 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Duplication,' etc.

The linear view extends the data with additional tracks, including a detailed gene annotation track, a scatterplot titled "Point Mutation," and tracks for "Insertion" and "Deletion." The scatterplot uses points to show genomic mutations, colored by subtype. Additional range annotation tracks depict copy number variations, marked in gray. Both views use color and spatial arrangement effectively to represent different types of genomic data, facilitating an in-depth exploration of genomic variations.
