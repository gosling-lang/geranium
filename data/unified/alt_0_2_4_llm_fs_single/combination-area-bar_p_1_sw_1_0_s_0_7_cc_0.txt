A linear genome visualization in a vertical arrangement, focusing on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. It includes two tracks. The top track is a bar chart representing the peak values in a multivec file, stratified by four sample categories. Each category is displayed in different colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The bars show minimum and maximum peak values along the y-axis. The bottom track is an area chart, also stratified by the same sample categories in corresponding colors, illustrating the peak expression values along the y-axis. Both tracks feature interactive tooltips providing genomic positions and peak values for each sample.
