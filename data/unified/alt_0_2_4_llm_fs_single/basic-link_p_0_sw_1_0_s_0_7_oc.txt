The visualization is a linear layout illustrating genomic links on chromosome 1. It features arcs representing connections between genomic positions specified in a CSV file. The arcs are colored in steel blue, with the title ‘Basic Marks: Link’ and the subtitle ‘Tutorial Examples’. The specified genomic intervals are displayed on the x-axis. This view uses a simple CSV data source with fields indicating chromosome and genomic positions, showcasing data connections between different genomic regions.
