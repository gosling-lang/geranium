A composite visualization in a vertical linear layout demonstrates diverse genomic data encoding methods across chromosome 1. The first track is a multivec heat map with intervals shown on the x-axis and expression values encoded by color intensity, stratified by samples. Subsequent tracks include bar charts illustrating expression values as bars on the y-axis, colored by sample categories. A line and scatter plot combines line and point marks, with point size indicating expression magnitude. Additional scatter plots display genomic positions against expression peaks, with colors representing sample categories. An area chart visualizes expression as color-filled areas, followed by a range bar chart with peak min-max values depicted. The final track, a withinLink chart, visualizes genomic connections with line color encoding position categories. The title is "Visual Encoding," accompanied by the subtitle "Gosling provides diverse visual encoding methods."
