The linear visualization presents an overlay of tracks featuring genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning an interval from 1 to 3,000,500. There are four rows corresponding to "sample 1" to "sample 4" from a multivec file. Each row displays a line chart and scatter plot, using lines and points to represent data. The x-axis shows genomic positions, while the y-axis conveys quantitative expression values. The size of the points changes according to the "peak" value. Colors denote different samples: blue, orange, green, and red. The visualization is titled "Example: Overlayed Tracks."
