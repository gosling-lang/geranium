A circular and linear genomic visualization is presented, connected by an interactive brush that highlights chromosome 1. The circular view contains tracks: an ideogram, a text annotation for "Putative Driver," blue rectangles for "Gain," and orange rectangles for "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," with a line-connection track showing links categorized by 'svclass'. The linear view mirrors the circular view with additional tracks: gene annotations, a "Point Mutation" scatterplot with colored points indicating different 'SUBTYPE', and range tracks for "Insertion," "Deletion," and "Copy Number Variants," showing quantitative measurements in gray. Rectangles for "Gain" and "LOH" are colored sky blue and dark orange, respectively.
