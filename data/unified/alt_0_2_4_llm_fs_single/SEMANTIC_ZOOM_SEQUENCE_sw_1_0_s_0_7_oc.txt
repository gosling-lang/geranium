The visualization showcases a linear bar chart with a focus on semantic zooming, titled "Example: Semantic Zooming" and subtitled "Text marks that indicate base pairs will appear when zooming in." This chart uses multivec data to represent genomic sequences, displaying base counts (A, T, G, C) along the y-axis while positioning them on the genomic x-axis. The chart employs an overlay alignment, featuring both bar and text marks. The bars, colored by base type, indicate category counts, while text annotations become visible upon zooming, emphasizing individual base pairs against a white background. The genomic positions are aligned horizontally, and the data is sourced from a specified URL. The visualization effectively highlights the dynamic aspect of data, enabling deeper insights upon closer inspection, particularly focusing on the base pair level.
