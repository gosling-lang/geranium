The visualization titled "Example: Brushing and Linking" is a dual track line chart in a linear layout, illustrating genomic data from a multivec file. Both tracks display data along chromosome 1, where the upper track spans the entire chromosome and the lower focuses on the region between 200,000,000 and 220,000,000 base pairs. The lines in the upper chart are colored pink, while the lower chart lines are purple. A brush interaction in the upper track, marked in steel blue, dynamically links with the bottom track, highlighting the selected genomic interval. This layout employs brush linking for enhanced interaction and data exploration.
