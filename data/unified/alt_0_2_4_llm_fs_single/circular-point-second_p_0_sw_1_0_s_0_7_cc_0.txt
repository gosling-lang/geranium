A circular scatter plot is displayed, visualizing multivec data with genomic positions on the x-axis. The scatter plot shows data for chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. Each point's position and size are determined by the 'peak' data field, while colors represent different samples, including 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The color legend is prominently displayed. The visualization has a transparent style with an opacity of 0.5, allowing overlap visibility. Data points are interactive, enabling users to view detailed information such as start and end positions, value, and sample category through tooltips.
