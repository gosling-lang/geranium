The "Matrix Visualization" compares Micro-C and Hi-C data for HFFc6 cells focusing on chromosome 7 between 77,700,000 and 81,000,000 base pairs. The visualization uses two linked views arranged horizontally, displaying genomic data in vertical and horizontal bar charts, position annotations, and matrix tracks.

**Vertical Bar Charts:**
- **HFFc6_H3K4me3:** Displays genomic intervals along the y-axis with expression levels represented as dark green bars.
- **HFFc6_ATAC:** Also uses genomic intervals along the y-axis, shown with orange bars.
- **HFFC6_CTCF:** Integrates overlays of bar tracks and genomic annotations with navy blue bars. Annotations feature genomic positions with right and left triangles representing different strands (pink and green).

**Horizontal Views:**
Each view contains:
- **Bar Charts:**
  - **HFFc6_H3K4me3:** Green bars indicating expression across genomic intervals.
  - **HFFc6_ATAC:** Orange bars following the same structure.
  - **Overlay tracks for CTCF:** With attributes similar to the vertical version.
  
**Matrix Visualizations:**
- **HFFc6_Micro-C and HFFc6_Hi-C:** Positioned within the horizontal arrangement, visualizing genomic interactions using color intensity representing data values.

**Additional Tracks:**
- **Epilogos (hg38):** Features multivec data
