A visualization composed of three charts linked interactively, demonstrating genomic data using a multivec file. The top section features a circular bar chart and a horizontal linear bar chart, both depicting genomic intervals and expression values with the y-axis. These charts are stratified by categories ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'), each represented by distinct colors. An interactive brush on the x-axis of both charts allows the adjustment of the range and position, linking to the detailed linear bar chart below.

The lower section presents an expanded linear bar chart focused on chromosome 1, specifically between 160,000,000 and 200,000,000 base pairs. The title, "Visual Linking," and the subtitle emphasize the interaction enabled by changing brush positions to update the detail view below. This setup highlights the integration of a circular overview with a detailed linear segment for comprehensive data analysis.
