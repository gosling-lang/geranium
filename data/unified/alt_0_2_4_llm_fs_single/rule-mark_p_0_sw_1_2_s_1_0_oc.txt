The visualization is a linear bar chart that integrates multiple overlays for annotation. It features genomic intervals on the x-axis and quantitative values on the y-axis, represented by light gray bars. This is overlaid with two additional rule-based tracks. The first track includes red horizontal and vertical lines with varying stroke widths, representing specific quantitative values. The second track adds consistent blue vertical lines, emphasizing certain genomic positions. The chart is titled "Rule Mark" with a subtitle emphasizing the annotation purpose, utilizing dashed styles for line distinction. The data is derived from a multivec file and a JSON source, focusing on genomic positions and their corresponding peak values within defined domains.
