This visualization represents a linear layout focusing on genomic connections on chromosome 1, with a specified domain between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. Titled "Visual Encoding" and subtitled "Arcs," the chart illustrates data from a CSV file, emphasizing links within the genome. The arcs are color-coded by the starting positions of genomic segments, using a diverse palette of colors like blue, orange, green, and purple to distinguish categories. The connections are lightly stroked in black and displayed with low opacity to allow overlapping arcs to be visible. The chart is linear in arrangement with vertical orientation, providing a clean and organized representation of the genomic data.
