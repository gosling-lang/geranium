A circular plot with vertical arrangement visualizes segmental duplications on chromosome 1. The visualization includes one track with genomic connections, demonstrating links within the specified genomic intervals from position 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. The color of each connection reflects different categories, with colors ranging from blue, orange, and green to red, purple, and more. The plot is static, with a central radius of 0.5, and is constructed using data from a CSV file.
