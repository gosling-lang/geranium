The visualization is a multi-row bar chart in a linear layout, showing genomic data across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. It uses a multivec file depicting four samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4') as distinct rows. Each sample is represented by bars depicting expression value ranges, with bars colored differently for each sample. The x-axis reflects genomic intervals, and the y-axis shows quantitative values, with the min and max values of 'peak' indicated by the top and bottom of bars. The chart includes a legend to distinguish sample categories by color.
