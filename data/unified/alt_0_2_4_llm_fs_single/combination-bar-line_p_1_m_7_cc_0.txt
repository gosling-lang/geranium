A vertical arrangement of two charts provides a detailed view of genomic data along chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top chart, a multi-line plot, stratifies lines by four samples, each distinguished by unique colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis reflects quantitative expression values. Lines showcase variations, with the size range adjusting to expression peaks.

Beneath, a scatter plot displays points representing expression values against genomic positions, colored consistently with the upper chart. Each pointâ€™s size correlates with its quantitative value. This dual representation enables analysis of multivec file data, emphasizing distinct sample categories through legends and tooltips. The use of colors across both charts aids in visual differentiation, facilitating comparisons of expression levels among samples.
