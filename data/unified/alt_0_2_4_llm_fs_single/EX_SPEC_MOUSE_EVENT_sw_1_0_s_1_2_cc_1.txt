A multi-track linear visualization features custom mouse events. The visualization comprises five different tracks:

1. **Individual Marks**: A bar chart displays genomic data along the x-axis, with the y-axis showing expression levels. Bars are color-coded to represent different categories, with interactive features for mouse hovering and selection.

2. **Group Marks By Sample**: Another bar chart groups data by sample, with colors indicating categories. It incorporates interactive grouping, highlighting, and brushing based on samples.

3. **Group Marks By Genomic Position**: A similar bar chart groups data by genomic position. Interactive features allow mouse over, selection, and grouping by position.

4. **Group Marks By Gene**: Displays genomic range annotations with text, highlighting genes on the x-axis. Tracks are stratified by categories, shown in colors on rectangles and triangles, with interaction based on gene names.

5. **Group Marks By Chromosome**: An ideogram shows chromosome details with text, rectangles, and triangles representing various categories. Interactive features allow mouse hover, selection, and grouping based on chromosomes.

The overall design is tailored for intuitive exploration of genome data, with a focus on user interaction and customization through mouse events.
