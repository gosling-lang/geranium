The visualization is a linear multivec chart titled "Example: Semantic Zooming," which visualizes genomic data across multiple chromosomes. The x-axis represents genomic positions, and the y-axis shows quantitative counts through bars. Each bar is colored based on the nucleotide type, with categories 'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C' being represented by different colors: blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. When zoomed in, text marks indicating base pairs appear, emphasizing the interactive nature of the visualization. The semantic zooming enables detailed viewing of base pair information, enhancing data interpretation.
