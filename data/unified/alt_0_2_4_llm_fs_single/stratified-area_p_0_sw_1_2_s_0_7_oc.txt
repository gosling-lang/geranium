The visualization is a linear layout of area charts representing multivec data, focusing on chromosome 1 from base position 1 to 3,000,500. It presents four samples ('sample 1' to 'sample 4') displayed in separate rows, with each sample's data colored distinctly. The x-axis displays genomic positions, and the y-axis quantifies the 'peak' values. Each area corresponds to a different sample category, highlighted in the legend with corresponding colors. Tooltips provide detailed information about genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample categories. The layout is set vertically with a center radius of 0.8, allowing distinctions between sample tracks, and is designed with interactive zoom capabilities.
