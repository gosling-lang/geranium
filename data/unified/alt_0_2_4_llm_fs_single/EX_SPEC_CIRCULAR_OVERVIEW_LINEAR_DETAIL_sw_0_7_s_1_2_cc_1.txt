The visualization consists of a vertically arranged set of charts featuring a circular view overlaying bar and link tracks, and horizontally aligned linear bar charts. The circular chart encodes genomic intervals along its circumference, displaying expression data in bar format with categories differentiated by color. Unique to this view are connection links that span different genomic regions, used to depict structural rearrangements across chromosomes. The linear views detail specific chromosome segments, highlighting chr5 and chr16, linked to the circular view via interactive brushes. Here, the bars are similarly stratified by categories, consistent in color with their circular counterparts. The distinctive hues and interactive elements aid in exploring complex genomic structures and variations.
