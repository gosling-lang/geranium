The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view in a vertical arrangement. The circular view includes five tracks such as a chromosomal ideogram, a point annotation track for putative drivers, and three range annotation tracks indicating genomic gains, losses of heterozygosity (LOH), and structural variations. The ideogram uses colored bands to depict chromosome features. The point annotation track marks significant genomic positions with text labels. The range tracks for gains and LOH display genomic ranges using blue and orange rectangles, respectively. A connection track visualizes structural variations with links of varying colors indicating categories like duplication, deletion, and inversion.

The linear view corresponds to the circular view, displaying chromosome 1 in detail. It includes an ideogram, a text annotation track for putative drivers, a scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation,' gene annotations, and additional tracks for copy number variations (CNVs). The scatterplot shows points representing mutation distances, color-coded by subtype. CNVs are visualized using a bar chart, and insertions and deletions are shown on separate tracks. Both views are linked interactively through a brush on the circular ideogram.
