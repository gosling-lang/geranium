A circular layout visualization displaying genomic data on chromosome 1 from intervals 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. The chart uses a within-link mark to show connections between different genomic positions. Each connection is colored distinctly according to the data in field 's1,' with categories highlighted in various colors such as blue, orange, green, and purple. The links are outlined in black with a stroke width of 0.5 and an opacity setting of 0.2. The visualization uses data from a CSV file, making it static on the genomic assembly of hg38.
