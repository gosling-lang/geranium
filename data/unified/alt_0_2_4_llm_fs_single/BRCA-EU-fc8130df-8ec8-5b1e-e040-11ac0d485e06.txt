The visualization consists of two main views: a circular view and a linear view, both organized in a vertical layout. 

### Circular View:
- **Structure:** Circular ideogram with multiple layers.
- **Tracks:**
  - **Ideogram Track:** Displays the full genome with color-coded bands representing different stains.
  - **Text Annotation Track:** Shows putative driver genes. Text is stratified in rows based on gene categories, colored in black.
  - **Range Annotation Tracks:**
    - "Gain" track displays genomic regions with gains in blue rectangles.
    - "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" track shows regions with loss in dark orange rectangles.
  - **Connection Track:** Illustrates connections between genomic positions using lines with colors representing structural variations: Gain, LOH, Translocation, Duplication, Deletion, and Inversions (TtT, HtH).

### Linear View:
- **Structure:** Straight timeline showing genomic data for Chromosome 1.
- **Tracks:**
  - **Ideogram:** Similar to the circular view, displaying chromosome bands.
  - **Putative Driver Text Track:** Annotates driver genes with text, same stratification and color as circular view.
  - **Point Mutation Scatterplot:** Visualizes mutations with positions represented along the x-axis and distances to previous mutations on the y-axis. Points are colored by mutation subtype (e.g., C>A, T>G).
  - **Indel Annotation
