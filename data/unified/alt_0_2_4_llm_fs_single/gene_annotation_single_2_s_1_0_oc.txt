**Description**: A genomic range annotation track titled "IGV" visualizes a section of chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The chart is arranged linearly, stratified by strand, with '+' and '-' strands shown in separate rows. The visualization includes text and geometric shapes marking gene locations. Genes are labeled in navy, while rectangles indicating gene locations are also navy. White lines with triangular patterns mark the direction of transcription, with right triangles for the '+' strand and left triangles for the '-' strand. The dataset is sourced from a BED database file containing genomic fields like start, end, and exon intervals.
