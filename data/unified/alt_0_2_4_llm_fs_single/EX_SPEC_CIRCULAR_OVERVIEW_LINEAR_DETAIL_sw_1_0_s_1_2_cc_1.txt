The visualization comprises a vertically arranged set of charts, featuring a circular and two horizontal bar charts. The circular chart includes two tracks: a bar chart and a connection track. The bar chart stratifies data by 'sample' across genomic positions, with rows colored in blue, orange, green, and red. Interactive brushes link to detailed views. The connection track visualizes genomic rearrangements as links, with stroke colors indicating categories like deletions and translocations. Below, two horizontal bar charts display genomic data for chromosomes 5 and 16. The bars, segmented by 'sample', illustrate expression levels with consistent color coding. Blue and red backgrounds emphasize their linked relationship with the circular chartâ€™s interactive brushes.
