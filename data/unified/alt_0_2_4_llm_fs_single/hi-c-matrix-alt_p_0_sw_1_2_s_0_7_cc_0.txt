The visualization titled "Hi-C Matrix" is a complex overlay of multiple tracks depicting genomic data. It encompasses a matrix view with genomic data represented on both x and y axes within an interval from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000. Expression values are encoded using a color intensity scale, influenced by a 'hot' color scheme. Additionally, overlaid horizontal and vertical pink lines serve as genomic annotations at specified positions across chromosomes 2, 5, and 10.

Further layers include a chart with purple points whose size reflects quantitative values. These annotations span across chromosomes 6, 7, and 8, with dashed lines indicating specific genomic features. The entire visualization is laid out in a linear orientation, providing an interactive and detailed depiction of Hi-C data over a defined genomic interval. The styling features dashed lines, light gray backgrounds, and the transparency in overlays enhances visualization comprehension.
