The visualization is a linear heat map displaying a multivec file for chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. It uses a vertical arrangement and colors the data based on the 'peak' value. There are four separate rows, each representing a sample ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'). The intensity of the color encodes the quantitative 'peak' values, with a color scale ranging from light to intense shades of brown, resembling a 'hot' color scheme. The x-axis shows genomic intervals, and the y-axis is stratified by sample categories with labels and legends included for clarity.
