Here is a detailed description of the visualization based on the provided JSON specification and processed attributes:

---

The visualization consists of three bar charts arranged vertically, each displaying genomic data. The charts focus on specific genomic intervals within chromosomes. The dataset is a multivec file from "https://server.gosling-lang.org" with a genomic zoom window of 5,000,000 to 15,000,000.

1. **Top Chart**:
   - **Chromosome**: 12
   - **Data Interval**: Between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000
   - **Encoding**: 
     - **X-Axis**: Genomic start and end positions
     - **Y-Axis**: Quantitative peak values
     - **Color**: Bars are green (`#85B348`)
   - **Design**: Features a thin white stroke around bars, enhancing the separation between data points.

2. **Middle Chart**:
   - **Chromosome**: 9
   - **Data Interval**: Between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000 
   - **Encoding**:
     - **X-Axis**: Genomic start and end positions
     - **Y-Axis**: Quantitative peak values
     - **Color**: Bars are sky blue (`#6daff4`)
   - **Design**: Includes a white stroke for clear delineation between bars.
