A circular heatmap represents genomic data from chromosome 1 within a range of 1 to 3,000,500. The layout is circular with vertical arrangement, focusing on visual encoding. The heatmap stratifies data into rows based on categories 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Color intensity indicates expression values, scaling with a 'hot' color range from light to dark. The chart's title is "Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts" with the subtitle "Heatmap". The tooltip provides genomic start and end positions along with the peak values for each sample. The design employs hg38 assembly for reference.
