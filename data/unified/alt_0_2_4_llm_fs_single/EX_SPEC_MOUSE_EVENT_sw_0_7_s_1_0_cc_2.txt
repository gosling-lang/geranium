The visualization comprises a series of charts including bar charts and a genomic annotation track. The title "Custom Mouse Events" indicates the focus on customizing interactivity, such as mouse hovering and range selections. The first three charts depict bar marks grouped by "Individual Marks," "Group Marks By Sample," and "Group Marks By Genomic Position" across chromosome 1. They showcase genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, with colors representing different categories. A genomic range annotation track titled "Group Marks By Gene" displays gene structures with triangles and rectangles aligned by strand orientation along chromosome 3. The final chart, "Group Marks By Chromosome," is an ideogram showing chromosome bands with additional annotations like text, colored rectangles, and triangles across multiple chromosomes. The visualization employs interactivity, enabling mouseover and range selection actions with styled visual cues such as color changes upon selection or hovering.
