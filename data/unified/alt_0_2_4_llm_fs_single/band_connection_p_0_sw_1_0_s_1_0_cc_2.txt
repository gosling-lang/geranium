The visualization is a linear layout focusing on a specified genomic interval of chromosome 1, between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. It incorporates seven tracks: four tracks with rectangular marks and three tracks with between-link marks. The rectangles illustrate genomic segments with varying colors—pink, purple, and sky blue—indicating different attributes or data categories from a CSV dataset. The connecting links, matching the color of the related rectangles, highlight the relationships between distinct genomic positions. The visualization is styled with low opacity and includes tooltip information, enhancing the interpretability of start and end positions for each genomic segment.
