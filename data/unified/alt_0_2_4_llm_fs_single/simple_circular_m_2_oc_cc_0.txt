The visualization is a circular chart consisting of two main tracks. The top track displays genomic data using colored areas, representing different samples across chromosome 1 of the hg38 assembly. Colors like blue, orange, green, and red indicate distinct categories. The y-axis encodes quantitative values corresponding to genomic positions on the x-axis, allowing for the comparison of expression levels across samples. The bottom track is an ideogram illustrating chromosome 1, with colored rectangles representing various chromosomal features. Colors range from white to shades of gray and blue, indicating different stain patterns. The visualization employs a spacing of 5 and a center radius of 0.6, effectively optimizing space within a 500x500 layout.
