A circular bar chart in a vertical layout visualizes a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The chart displays four samples named 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is represented in a distinct color, with the height of the bars indicating expression levels, and a grid is present for the y-axis. The chart is static, centered at a radius of 0.5, and includes interactive tooltips showing the start and end genomic positions, expression values, and sample names.
