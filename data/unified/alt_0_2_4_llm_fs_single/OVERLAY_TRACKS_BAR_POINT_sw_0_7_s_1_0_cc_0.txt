The visualization is a linear track that overlays bars and points, illustrating genomic significance on chromosome 3. It utilizes a BEDDB data source to represent genomic intervals. The x-axis indicates genomic positions with fields "start" and "end." The y-axis categorizes significance levels, including "Pathogenic," "Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic," "Likely Pathogenic," "Uncertain Significance," "Likely Benign," "Benign/Likely Benign," and "Benign." Bars have varied stroke colors, while points are color-coded with a legend for significance. The title of the chart is "Example: Overlay Tracks."
