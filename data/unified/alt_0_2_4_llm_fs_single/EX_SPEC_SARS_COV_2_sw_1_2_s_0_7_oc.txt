The visualization is a linear representation of the entire genome of SARS-CoV-2, consisting of various tracks to display genomic data. The top track titled "NC_045512.2 Genes" highlights gene regions with blue rectangles and white lines. These rectangles have gene symbols annotated in black text. Below, the "S Protein Annotation" track displays specific protein domains within the S gene, with colors denoting different protein features such as RBD and RBM.

Another track shows the whole gene sequence using colored bars for nucleotides A, T, G, and C, providing clarity between distinct genomic regions. Lastly, "TRS-L-Dependent Recombination Events" are shown with arcs in a downward direction, using navy blue color to indicate recombination connections. The layout includes interactive elements like a linking brush for detailed exploration, and the entire structure is set against a clean linear format. The title emphasizes the data sources, including WashU Virus Genome Browser, NCBI, and GISAID.
