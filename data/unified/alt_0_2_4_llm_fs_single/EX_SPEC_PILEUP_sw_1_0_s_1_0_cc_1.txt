**Description:**

The visualization features a linear layout showcasing BAM data in two tracks, focusing on chromosome 1 between positions 136,750 and 139,450. The top track is a coverage chart depicted as a bar chart titled “example_higlass.bam,” where the height of the bars indicates the number of aligned reads, colored in light red. The bottom track is a pileup chart, which presents individual reads as rectangles, stratified by rows to represent various structural variations such as "normal read," "deletion (+-)," "inversion (++)," and others. These variations are color-coded, with gray for 'normal read' and distinct colors for others, such as yellow for 'deletion (+-)' and red for 'mates not found within chromosome.' The layout includes tooltips for genomic positions, insert sizes, and structural variation types, enhancing interactivity. The visualization’s design incorporates a subtle outline and legend explaining the insert sizes and color encoding in the pileup track.
