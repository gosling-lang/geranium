A linear visualization showing genomic data from a multivec file, focused on chromosome 2 of assembly hg38. The top track is a line chart with three rows, each representing 'sample 1', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', using orange, green, and blue lines respectively. The bottom track is an area chart with two rows, showing 'sample 1' and 'sample 2' in orange and green. Both tracks display data on the x-axis for genomic positions and the y-axis for quantitative 'peak' values. The visualization includes category-specific color coding and legends for clarity.
