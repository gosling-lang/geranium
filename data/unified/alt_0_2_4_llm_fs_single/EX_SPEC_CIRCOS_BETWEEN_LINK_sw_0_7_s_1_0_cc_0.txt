A visualization in a circular layout showcases genomic data with parallel arrangements, titled "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements." The outermost track features a circular bar chart where genomic intervals are represented on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis, with bars colored pink. Enclosed within, two circular ideograms display genomic intervals, using a color spectrum to differentiate categories based on the Stain field. Between these ideograms, a circular chart layer draws connections using light gray and black strokes, signifying data correlation across genomic positions, with some links filtered to display specific chromosome ranges. The arrangement is defined by a static, parallel alignment, emphasizing stacked layers centered around a 0.3 radius.
