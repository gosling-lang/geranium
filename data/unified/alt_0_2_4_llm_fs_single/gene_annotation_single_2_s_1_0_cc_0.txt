The visualization titled "IGV" is a genomic range annotation track with text in a linear layout, focusing on chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. It uses a vertical arrangement to stratify by strands, with two rows representing positive and negative strands. Each gene is visualized using pink text and rectangles, and directional lines are represented by white, semi-transparent triangular patterns, indicating the gene's strand orientation. The genomic data is sourced from a BEDDB file through a specified URL, highlighting genes with their respective annotations.
