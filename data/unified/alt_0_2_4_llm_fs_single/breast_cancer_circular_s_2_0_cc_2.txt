**Description**: 

This circular visualization depicts various genomic data across multiple tracks. The outermost track is an ideogram representing the human genome assembly hg38, with chromosomes color-coded to indicate different staining patterns.

The middle track displays regions of copy number variations (CNVs) using pink and green rectangles. The pink rectangles represent regions with a loss of genetic material (minor allele copy number is zero), while green rectangles indicate regions of gain (total copy number is above average).

The innermost track contains connections representing genomic rearrangements. These connections are color-coded to signify different structural variants, such as tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions. Strokes also vary in color to match distinct categories of structural variations, providing a comprehensive view of the genomic structure and variations. 

Overall, this visualization offers a detailed look at genomic features and alterations, aiding in the analysis of genetic data.
