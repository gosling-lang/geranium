A circular visualization shows two scatter plots arranged side by side, representing genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. Each plot is circular and stratified into four rows, corresponding to 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' Points are used to represent expression values, with both size and position encoded by the 'peak' value from a multivec file. Colors of the points signify different samples: blue, orange, green, and red. The visualization is static and includes tooltips displaying genomic start and end positions, value, and sample type when hovered over. A legend on each plot further distinguishes the samples by color.
