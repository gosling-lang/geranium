A scatter plot in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, showing the region on chromosome 1 between 1 and 3,000,500. Points represent genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, encoded by both size and color. Four categories, 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4,' are indicated by different colors. The chart includes a legend, and data points have an opacity of 0.5, providing a visual representation with grid lines for clarity.
