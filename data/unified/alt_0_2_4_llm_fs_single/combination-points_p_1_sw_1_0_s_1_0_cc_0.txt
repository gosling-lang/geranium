The visualization contains two adjacent scatter plots arranged vertically, showcasing genomic data on chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The top scatter plot displays expression values as points, with their position, size, and color indicating the genomic position, expression magnitude, and sample category, respectively. Colors used are blue, orange, green, and red representing "sample 1" to "sample 4," with grid lines aiding in value comparison along the y-axis. The lower scatter plot is structured by rows for each sample category, maintaining the same color scheme for differentiation. Both plots use transparency to visually integrate overlapping data points, and tooltips provide detailed genomic and expression information, enhancing user interaction.
