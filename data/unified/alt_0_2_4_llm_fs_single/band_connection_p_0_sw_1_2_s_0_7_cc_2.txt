The visualization is a linear genomic plot focusing on chromosome 1 between 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. It consists of three main types of tracks, primarily using CSV data to depict genomic intervals. The plot employs rectangles to highlight genomic regions, with a pink color at low opacity for visualization. Stretching across the intervals, connection links in purple and pink illustrate relationships between genomic positions, adding depth to the data interpretation. The use of light pink rectangles and links facilitate visual clarity and emphasize the data's connectivity. The horizontal layout, subtle stroke, and strategic use of color mapping enhance the focus on genomic duplication and structural variations, providing a comprehensive view of this chromosomal segment.
