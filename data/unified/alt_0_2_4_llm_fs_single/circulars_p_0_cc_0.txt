A circular visualization showcasing diverse visual encoding methods using data from chromosome 1 within the interval 1 to 3,000,500. The title "Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts" and subtitle "Gosling provides diverse visual encoding methods in circular layouts" are displayed. The layout features multiple charts, each using different marks such as bars, lines, points, areas, and connections to represent data across rows for samples 1 to 4, with each sample uniquely colored. 

The first chart presents a circular bar chart where the genomic positions are shown on the x-axis, and expression values are displayed as bars on the y-axis. The lines and points in the next chart indicate expression values, with size encoding the expression values on the size-axis. Another chart illustrates genomic intervals connected by lines, highlighting relationships between positions. An area chart displays expression values filled by color, organized by sample rows. A heatmap encodes expression values using color intensity, across the specified genomic range.

Scatter plots visualize points representing expression data. The size and color denote quantitative values, stratified by sample categories. Tooltip information provides genomic positions, peak values, and sample identifiers for interaction. Overall, the visualization leverages a circular layout to efficiently encode complex genomic data, facilitating comparative genomic analysis.
