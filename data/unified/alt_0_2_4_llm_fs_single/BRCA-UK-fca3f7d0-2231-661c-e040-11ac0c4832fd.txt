A visualization composed of a circular and a linear view, linked by a blue interactive brush. The circular view presents five tracks, including an ideogram, a point annotation track labeled 'Putative Driver', and two genomic range annotation tracksâ€”'Gain' in blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange. A line-connection track shows structural variations between genomic positions, with categories like 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion' denoted by color-coded lines. The linear view zooms into chromosome 1 and features similar annotations, plus a gene track, a scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation' visualizing VCF data, and two additional range annotations for insertions and deletions, each distinguished by color.
