The visualization consists of two linear scatter plots, each visualizing genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. Both plots display data points corresponding to expression peaks across four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. 

In the top plot, points are sized and colored based on the expression peak value and sample category, respectively. The x-axis represents genomic position, while the y-axis represents expression values, with grid lines for better visual reference.

The bottom plot is stratified by sample categories, displaying rows for each sample. Points are similarly sized and colored as in the top plot. Each plot is interactive, featuring a tooltip that displays detailed information about genomic start and end positions, peak value, and sample data when hovered over. The transparency of points is set to 0.5, providing a clear view of overlapping data points. The layout is vertically arranged, ensuring a comprehensive comparison between the different samples across the genomic region.
