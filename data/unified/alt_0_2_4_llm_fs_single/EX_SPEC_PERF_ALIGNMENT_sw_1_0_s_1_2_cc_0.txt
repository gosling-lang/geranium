A dual-panel visualization comparing two approaches to graphical rendering. The concept, "Smoother Zoom," demonstrates scaling elements rather than redrawing them. The top panel, titled "New Approach: Stretching Tiles," and the bottom panel, "Original Approach," both display genomic data as colored rectangles with overlaid text. Each track shows categories stratified by rows with distinct colors representing base pairs. The panels illustrate the genomic intervals from 350 to 396, leveraging a CSV dataset, with white strokes and no legend, ensuring clarity and focus on the visual differences between methods.
