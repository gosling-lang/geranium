The visualization consists of a circular and linear view arranged vertically. The circular view shows the entire genome with tracks for ideogram and genomic variations, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. An interactive brush in the circular chart links to the linear chart. The circular view includes an ideogram and multiple genomic range annotations like 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' represented by blue and orange rectangles, respectively. The linear view features a detailed ideogram, text annotations for 'Putative Driver' genes, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation', and tracks for insertions, deletions, and copy number variations. Colors and connections denote different genomic alterations such as 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and inversions, providing a comprehensive depiction of structural variations.
