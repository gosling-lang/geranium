The visualization depicts a circular bar chart showcasing genomic intervals on chromosome 12, ranging from positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. It is based on a multivec data file and stratified by categories, each represented through different colors in the bars. The categories span 16 samples, with color assignments including shades like blue, orange, green, and red. The chart employs varied opacity levels to differentiate between visibility thresholds, adjusting quantitative domains for the 'peak' field. Enhanced with responsive features, the layout adapts from circular to linear based on specified aspect ratio thresholds, ensuring alignment with graphical perception principles. This model's responsive design is informed by a study on multiple time series visualization for optimized legibility across varying interface dimensions.
