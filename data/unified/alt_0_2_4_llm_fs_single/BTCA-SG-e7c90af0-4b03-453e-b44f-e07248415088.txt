The visualization consists of a circular and a linear genomic view, representing data from the hg19 assembly. The circular view includes a detailed ideogram with genomic intervals, annotated with categories indicated by color-coded rectangles. Tracks display text labels for putative genes, genomic range annotations like 'Gain' in sky blue rectangles and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange, along with connection lines signifying structural variations. These variations include 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion,' highlighted in distinct colors.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and features an ideogram, putative driver annotations, and point mutations displayed in a scatterplot. Mutations are categorized by subtype and positioned by distance to previous mutations. Rows denote insertion and deletion events, with 'Copy Number Variants' presented in a separate track using grey rectangles. Interactive elements, such as a blue brush linking views, enhance exploration. The circular layout's interactive brush aligns with the linear view, ensuring synchronized navigation through the genomic data.
