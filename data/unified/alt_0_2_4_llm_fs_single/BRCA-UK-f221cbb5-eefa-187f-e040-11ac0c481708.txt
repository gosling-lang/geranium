A circular and linear visualization displays the human genome (hg19). The circular view includes tracks such as an ideogram, text annotations, and genomic ranges titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH).' It features connections indicating structural variations like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication,' colored by category. A blue interactive brush links the circular to the linear view, which focuses on chromosome 1. The linear view expands with tracks for point mutations, insertions, deletions, and copy number variants. Points in the 'Point Mutation' track are colored by subtype, while genomic ranges and annotation tracks further highlight variant types and quantities.
