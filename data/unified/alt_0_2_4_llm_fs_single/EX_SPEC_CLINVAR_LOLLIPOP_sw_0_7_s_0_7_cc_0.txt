The visualization consists of three stacked linear views, each displaying genomic data along chromosome 13, encompassing specific intervals. Each view uses colored triangular arrows, text, and rectangles to represent genes and exons, with strands depicted in blue and orange. Each view also includes ClinVar significance data, visualized through bars and points in categories like pathogenic and likely benign in various colors. The chromosome's scale is shown on the top axis, facilitating navigation across different regions. The visualization emphasizes genetic variation alongside gene annotations.
