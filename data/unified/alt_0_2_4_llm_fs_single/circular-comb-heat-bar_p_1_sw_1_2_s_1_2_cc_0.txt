A circular visualization features two tracks arranged vertically. The left track is a circular bar chart depicting genomic positions from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. Expression data across four samples—'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'—is shown using colored bars. Each sample is represented by a distinct color: blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The right track is a circular heatmap showing the same genomic range, with expression values encoded through color intensity. Categories are displayed using rows, and both charts include interactive tooltips for genomic start and end positions, peaks, and sample information. The layout uses a circular arrangement, displaying data from a multivec file in a static view, while maintaining a consistent view of chromosome 1.
