The visualization consists of two linked line charts in a linear layout, titled "Example: Brushing and Linking." The top chart presents the entire chromosome 1 of the genome on the x-axis, with expression values shown on the y-axis as an orange line. An interactive brush is used on the x-axis to select a region for detailed examination. The bottom chart provides a zoomed-in view of chromosome 1, showcasing the interval from 200,000,000 to 220,000,000. The background of the zoomed area is highlighted in steel blue, indicating the selected region. Data is sourced from a multivec file, focusing on a single sample category. The linking feature enhances data exploration by allowing users to interactively focus on specific genomic regions.
