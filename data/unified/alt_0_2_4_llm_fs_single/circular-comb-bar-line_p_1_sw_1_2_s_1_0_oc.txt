Circular visualization with two tracks showing data for chromosome 1, spanning from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The left track presents a circular line and scatter plot, stratified by four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4.' Lines and points indicate expression values, colored differently based on categories. The size of the points is determined by expression value. The right track is a circular bar chart displaying expression values as bars. Both tracks share a genomic axis and a legend representing the categories by color. The visualization uses data from a multivec file.
