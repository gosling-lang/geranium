The visualization "Breast Cancer Variant (Staaf et al. 2019)" displays genetic characteristics of RAD51C- and PALB2-altered TNBCs using a combination of circular and linear layouts. The circular view includes tracks such as a patient overview ideogram, putative driver annotations, segments highlighting events of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in orange, genomic gains in green, and connections representing structural variants in different colors based on their class (e.g., tandem-duplication, translocation, deletion, inversion).

In the linear view, the ideogram provides an overview of chromosome 1, featuring gene annotations with directional arrows indicating strand orientation. Tracks display detailed features like LOH and gain events, with connections illustrating structural variants colored by class, and additional tracks for BAM data showing coverage and pileups, revealing alignment details and structural variations in specific chromosomal regions. This comprehensive visualization links genomic data across multiple views to explore cancer-related genetic alterations.
