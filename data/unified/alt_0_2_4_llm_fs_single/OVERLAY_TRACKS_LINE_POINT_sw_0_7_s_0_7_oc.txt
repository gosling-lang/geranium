The visualization titled "Example: Overlayed Tracks" displays a linear chart that overlays line and scatter plots. This visualization represents genomic data across chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. The x-axis shows genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative expression values, highlighted through lines and points. The chart is stratified into rows for four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each depicted in different colors. Points within the scatter plot vary in size according to the 'peak' value, emphasizing regions of interest across categories in a color-coded manner. The chart is set in an hg38 assembly and allows for interactive exploration.
