A circular visualization, titled "Circos," displays genomic data. The layout consists of three tracks: a bar chart, an ideogram, and a connection chart. The outermost track, a bar chart, represents genomic positions on the x-axis with quantitative 'peak' values on the y-axis, shown as purple bars. The middle track, an ideogram, uses colored rectangles to indicate different stain categories across genomic intervals. The innermost track displays connections between genomic positions as colored lines, representing chromosomal segments and duplication events. The tracks are aligned in a stacked configuration within a circular layout.
