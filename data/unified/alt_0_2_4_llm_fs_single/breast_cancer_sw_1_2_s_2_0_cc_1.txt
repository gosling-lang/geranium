A linear genomic visualization displays data from chromosome 1 using various tracks. The first track is an ideogram with colored blocks representing different chromosomal bands, using colors like blue and orange. It includes arrows indicating gene orientation, with right-pointing triangles for positive strand and left-pointing triangles for negative strand genes. The next track annotates genomic positions with blue and orange triangles representing genes on different strands.

Following that, two rectangle tracks depict copy number variations (CNV) from a CSV file, where sky blue rectangles show genomic intervals. The last track shows structural variations with connection lines, colored based on variation type, like tandem duplications and translocations. This comprehensive layout is linked by an interactive brush allowing exploration of genomic data.
