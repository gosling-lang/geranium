A circular scatter plot displays genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500, visualized in a circular layout. Each point represents an expression value, with the position along the circle corresponding to genomic position and the distance from the center reflecting the peak expression value. Points are colored based on categorization into samples 1 through 4, with distinct colors for each category. The size of the points also correlates with the expression value. The plot includes interactive elements such as tooltips that reveal additional information, such as start and end positions, upon hovering. The opacity of points is set to 0.5, allowing for overlap visibility. The chart is styled to provide clarity and detailed genomic visualization.
