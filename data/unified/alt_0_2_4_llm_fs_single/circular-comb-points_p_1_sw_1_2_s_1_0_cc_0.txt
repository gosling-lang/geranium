The visualization displays a circular plot with two tracks, each utilizing a scatter plot to represent genomic data from chromosome 1, covering positions 1 to 3,000,500. The left track shows genome positions on the x-axis, with the expression values on the y-axis, encoded as point sizes. Points are colored according to category, using a nominal scale with colors like blue, orange, green, and red for samples 1 to 4.

The right track is similarly structured, with an additional stratification by rows for categories, enhancing categorical comparisons. Both tracks use multivec data representing 'peak' values across different 'sample' categories, providing detailed insights into genomic variabilities and trends across the specified genomic intervals.
