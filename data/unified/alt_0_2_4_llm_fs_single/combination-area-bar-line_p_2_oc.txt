The visualization consists of a multi-view genomic chart in a linear layout, focusing on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. It includes three vertically arranged tracks:

1. **Line and Scatter Plot**: This track shows genomic positions on the x-axis with expression levels on the y-axis presented as lines and points. Each category, identified by samples 1 to 4, is distinguished by color. The point sizes vary based on expression values.

2. **Bar Chart**: This track also maps genomic positions on the x-axis but displays expression levels using bars on the y-axis. The categories are indicated by different colors, allowing comparison across samples.

3. **Area Chart**: Again mapping genomic positions on the x-axis, this chart uses filled areas to depict expression levels, stratified by category. The categories are color-coded, matching the previous tracks.

The visualization allows for easy comparison of genomic expression levels across different samples, with colors representing distinct categories. Data tooltip provides genomic position and expression value details on hover.
