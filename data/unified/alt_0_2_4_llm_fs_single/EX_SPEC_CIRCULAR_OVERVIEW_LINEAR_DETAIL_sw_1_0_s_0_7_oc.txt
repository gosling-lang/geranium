A vertically arranged visualization features a circular chart and two horizontal bar charts below. The circular chart displays genomic intervals with stacked bar rows, representing four samples, differentiated by unique colors. Links connect genomic regions, visually indicating types of rearrangements with varying stroke colors and widths. Two horizontal bar charts provide detailed views on chromosomes 5 and 16, with respective brushes in blue and red, further elucidating the data distribution across samples. The assembly used is hg38, and the overall style emphasizes interactive exploration with a focus on structural variations.
