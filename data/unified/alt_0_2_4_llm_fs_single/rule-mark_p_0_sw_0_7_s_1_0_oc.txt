The visualization consists of a multi-layered chart structured in a linear layout, designed to annotate genomic data using horizontal and vertical lines. It integrates a multivec file to display chromosome positions for "sample 1" on the x-axis, with their corresponding expression levels represented as light gray bars on the y-axis, ranging from 0 to 0.003. The chart is titled "Rule Mark," with a subtitle emphasizing its annotation purpose.

Three overlaid tracks feature distinct markings: the first is a bar chart showcasing the genomic intervals, while the second and third tracks utilize "rule" marks. The second track introduces vertical lines in red, annotated based on a JSON dataset with specific genomic positions, displaying varying thickness proportional to expression values. The third track uses blue lines to highlight specific positions, maintaining a consistent stroke width.

Notably, the visualization features a dashed styling pattern that enhances the distinction between different layers of data presentation. It spans a width of 500 and height of 230, encoded within the genomic assembly hg38, indicating its relevance to human genome analysis.
