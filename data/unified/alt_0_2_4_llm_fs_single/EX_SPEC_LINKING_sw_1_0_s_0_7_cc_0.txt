The visualization "Visual Linking" presents genomic data from chromosome 1 using a multivec file. It is structured vertically and includes interactive elements for detail exploration. The circular chart at the top displays four rows representing different samples, with each row color-coded using distinct shades like blue, orange, green, and red. Each bar represents the expression level of genomic intervals along the circular x-axis. 

Below, two linear bar charts provide detailed linear views of genomic data along chromosome 1. Both linear charts include interactive brushes that link to the circular chart, allowing dynamic updating of the displayed genomic range. The detail view focuses on positions between 160,000,000 and 200,000,000 on chromosome 1, showing the peak expression values for each sample. The title "Visual Linking" and subtitle guide the user on how to interact with the charts for detailed genomic analysis.
