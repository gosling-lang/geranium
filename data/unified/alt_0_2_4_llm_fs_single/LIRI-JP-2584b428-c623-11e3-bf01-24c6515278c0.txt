The visualization displays a genomic data set in a combined circular and linear format, using the human genome assembly hg19. The circular view includes multiple tracks like an ideogram, a "Putative Driver" text annotation, and two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," which are colored in sky blue and dark orange, respectively. The circular view also features connections between genomic positions, depicted in various colors representing structural variations such as 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and different 'Inversions.' The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, featuring additional tracks such as a gene annotation, a scatter plot labeled "Point Mutation," and further range annotations including "Insertion" and "Deletion," which are represented with rectangles in distinct colors. The scatter plot shows point mutations in different colors based on mutation subtypes. Both views are interconnected by an interactive brush in the circular ideogram, allowing for synchronized navigation.
