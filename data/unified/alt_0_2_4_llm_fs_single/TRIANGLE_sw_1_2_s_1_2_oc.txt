The visualization is a genomic position annotation track displayed in a linear layout. It is titled "Basic Marks: Triangles" with a subtitle "Tutorial Examples." The chart depicts genomic data with right and left triangles indicating the strand direction of genes within the human genome (assembly hg38). The x-axis represents genomic positions across various chromosomes. The chart is stratified into rows based on the strand field, with '+' and '-' strands shown. Right-facing triangles for the '+' strand are colored blue, and left-facing triangles for the '-' strand are colored red. Each triangle's position along the x-axis marks the genomic location of a gene's start or end, depending on the strand. The transparency of the triangles is set to 80%.
