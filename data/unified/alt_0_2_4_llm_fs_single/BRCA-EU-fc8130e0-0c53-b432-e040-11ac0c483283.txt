A circular and a linear view display genomic data, linked by a blue interactive brush. The circular view includes tracks: an ideogram, a "Putative Driver" annotation, "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" tracks with blue and orange rectangles, respectively, and a line-connection track illustrating genomic positions with elliptical links colored by categories like 'Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion'. The linear view expands on chromosome 1, retaining similar tracks with additional ones: gene annotation using triangle and rectangle glyphs, a "Point Mutation" scatterplot highlighting mutation distances colored by subtype, and "Copy Number Variants" showing quantitative data as gray bars.
