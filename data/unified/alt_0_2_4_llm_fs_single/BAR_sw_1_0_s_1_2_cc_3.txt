The visualization displays a linear bar chart titled "Basic Marks: bar" with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples." It utilizes a multivec dataset showing genomic data spanning multiple chromosomes (chr1 to chrY) of the hg38 assembly. The x-axis represents genomic intervals, while the y-axis encodes the expression values. Each bar is colored green, with a fixed size value of 5. The chart visualizes data for one sample category, "sample 1," with a bin size of 5 for displaying genomic positions.
