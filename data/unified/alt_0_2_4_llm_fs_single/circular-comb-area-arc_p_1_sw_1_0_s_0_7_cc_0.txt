The visualization comprises a circular chart layout with two primary tracks. The left track displays genomic connections using a withinLink mark, connecting regions on chromosome 1 between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. The connections are colored according to distinct categories, indicating different genomic segments. The right track showcases an area chart, stratified by samples and showcasing genomic intervals on chromosome 1. This area chart uses four samples, each represented by distinct colors. The height of the area corresponds to quantitative "peak" values, providing insight into expression levels across the genome. The charts are arranged vertically and use a consistent color scheme to differentiate between samples and categories.
