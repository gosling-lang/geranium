The visualization comprises two main views arranged vertically: a circular view and a linear view. The circular view provides a complete genome overview, while the linear view zooms into chromosome 1. The circular view features several tracks: an ideogram, a text track titled "Putative Driver," two range annotation tracks ("Gain" with blue rectangles and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" with dark orange rectangles), and a line-connection track visualizing genomic links in various colors based on the 'svclass' field. Categories include 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and types of 'Inversion.' The linear view mirrors these features but adds a gene annotation track, a scatterplot titled "Point Mutation," and additional annotation tracks. The scatterplot visualizes point mutations categorized by subtype, using a VCF file. Overall, this visualization provides detailed genomic data insights with interactive and color-coded elements, allowing for comprehensive analysis of genomic variants.
