A linear layout visualization displaying genomic data from a multivec file. The top chart features a green line representing expression values across chromosome 1, with a blue interactive brush for linking. The bottom chart, titled "Example: Brushing and Linking," depicts purple lines indicating expression values over a specified interval on chromosome 1 (200,000,000 to 220,000,000). The brushing interaction allows detail exploration between the two charts.
