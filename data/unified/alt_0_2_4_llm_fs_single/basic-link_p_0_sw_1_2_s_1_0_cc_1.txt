A linear chart showcases genomic connections on chromosome 1 using CSV data for visualization. Titled "Basic Marks: Link" with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples," it features arcs representing links between genomic positions. These arcs are distinguished by a light purple stroke. The two main domains represent genomic fields and the x-axis, with coordinates ranging up to 200,000,000. The chart facilitates interactive exploration of DNA structures and duplications, highlighting the relationships between genomic intervals.
