The visualization is a text-based genomic chart displayed in a linear layout. The chart visualizes a multivec file across the entire genome of hg38, with axes representing genomic positions and quantitative counts. The x-axis shows genomic intervals, while the y-axis reflects expression values indicated by the size and position of the text. Four categories—'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C'—are encoded using specific colors, namely blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The title of the chart is 'Basic Marks: Text', and it includes a subtitle 'Tutorial Examples', indicating a pedagogical context.
