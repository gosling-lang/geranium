A multi-layer genomic visualization composed of a circular view and a linear view. The circular view provides a complete overview of the hg19 genome, featuring tracks for ideograms, annotated gene drivers, genomic gains, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and structural variants. Interactive brushing allows linking with the linear view focused on chromosome 1. The linear view displays ideograms, gene annotations, point mutations, insertions, deletions, and copy number variations (CNV). Blue rectangles indicate genomic gains, while orange rectangles signify LOH regions. The tracks show connections and variations, highlighting data fields such as 'svclass' and 'SUBTYPE,' with interactive tooltips offering detailed genomic information per category.
