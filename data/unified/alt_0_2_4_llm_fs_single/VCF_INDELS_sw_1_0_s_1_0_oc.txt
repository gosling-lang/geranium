This linear visualization displays insertions and deletions from a VCF file across multiple chromosomes, including chr1, chr3, chr6, chr8, chr12, chr16, and chr22. The chart features rows for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion,' with each type differentiated by colorâ€”orange for 'Insertion' and green for 'Deletion.' Genomic positions along the x-axis depict the start and end positions of each variant, emphasizing the diversity and distribution of mutations. The opacity of the visual elements provides clarity, enhancing the interpretation of overlapping features. The chart is titled "Insertions and deletions from a VCF file."
