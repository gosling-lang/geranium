The visualization presents a set of parallel area charts layered with ideograms, representing genomic data across chromosomes 1 to 5. Each view comprises two tracks: an area chart visualizing multivec data and an ideogram overlay. The area chart displays genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peaks on the y-axis, with areas colored by sample categories in distinct hues such as blue, orange, and green. Below, the ideogram track uses colored rectangles to indicate cytogenetic bands, with additional features like maroon triangles marking specific stain regions. The layout is linear, and each chromosome's data is displayed side by side, providing an interactive, comparative genomic view.
