The visualization is a horizontal linear plot that depicts insertions and deletions in a genomic dataset sourced from a VCF file. Positioned against the genome shown along the x-axis, the plot is divided into categories portrayed by distinct rows labeled 'Insertion' and 'Deletion.' Rectangles represent genomic events, color-coded using orange for insertions and green for deletions. The chart includes interactive features to adjust visibility based on zoom levels. The subtitle "Insertions and deletions from a VCF file" conveys the dataset's nature, while tooltip interactions provide additional details such as the genomic position, REF, ALT, and QUAL values.
