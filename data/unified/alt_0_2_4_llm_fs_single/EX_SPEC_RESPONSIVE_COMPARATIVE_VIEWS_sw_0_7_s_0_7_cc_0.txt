The visualization consists of three linear bar charts arranged vertically. Each chart represents genomic data from a multivec file on chromosomes 9 and 12, ranging between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000.

1. **First Bar Chart**: 
   - **Chromosome**: 12
   - **Color**: Purple
   - **Data**: Genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis.
   - **Styling**: White stroke with a width of 0.5 units.

2. **Second Bar Chart**:
   - **Chromosome**: 9
   - **Color**: Green
   - **Data**: Similar genomic layout as the first, with quantitative peak values.
   - **Styling**: White stroke with a width of 0.5 units.

3. **Third Bar Chart**:
   - **Chromosome**: 12
   - **Color**: Purple, mirroring the first chart.
   - **Data**: Echoes the genomic and quantitative structure observed previously.
   - **Styling**: White stroke with a width of 0.5 units.

The charts rely on a responsive layout that adjusts horizontally and support dimensions wider than 1200 units, transitioning to a vertical arrangement for narrower displays. The data highlights changes in expression values across specified genomic intervals, coded through consistent bar designs and distinct color patterns to aid visual differentiation.
