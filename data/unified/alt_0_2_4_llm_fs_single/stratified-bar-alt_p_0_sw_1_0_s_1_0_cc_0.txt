A linear, multi-row bar chart displays multivec data for chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 using the hg38 genome assembly. Four samples, each represented by a row, are illustrated with distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis denotes genomic intervals, while the y and ye-axes depict minimum and maximum peak values, respectively. The data is stratified by sample, with categories indicated through the bar colors. Black strokes outline each bar for emphasis. The interactive tooltip provides genomic position, minimum and maximum peak values, and sample information.
