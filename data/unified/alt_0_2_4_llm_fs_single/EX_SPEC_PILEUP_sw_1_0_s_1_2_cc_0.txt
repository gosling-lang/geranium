The visualization presents a linear layout with two complementary tracks for analyzing BAM file data on chromosome 1, spanning from 136,750 to 139,450. The top track is a bar chart titled "example_higlass.bam," depicting coverage across genomic intervals with silver-colored bars, indicating expression levels on the y-axis. Below, the pileup track uses rectangles to illustrate individual read alignments, stratified by rows indicating structural variation types. The variations include "normal read," "deletion (+-)," "inversion (++)," "inversion (--)," "duplication (-+)," "more than two mates," "mates not found within chromosome," and "clipping," each differentiated by a color, such as yellow for deletions and red for reads lacking mates in the chromosome. The visualization provides an insightful representation of genomic structural variations using a color-coded scheme within a specified genomic range.
