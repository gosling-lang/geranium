A circular bar chart visualizes vector data in a circular layout with a static arrangement. The chart represents genomic data, with the genome positioned on the x-axis. The y-axis displays quantitative values labeled as 'peak.' Each bar is colored pink, enhancing visibility against the chart's background. The data source is a vector file accessed via a specified URL. The visualization employs a circular stacking alignment, and it features a center radius of 0.3. The chart's size is defined with a width and height of approximately 588 units, providing a comprehensive overview of genomic expressions in a compact circular form.
