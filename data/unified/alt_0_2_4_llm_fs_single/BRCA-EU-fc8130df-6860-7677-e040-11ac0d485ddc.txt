A comprehensive visualization displaying genomic data in both circular and linear layouts. The circular view includes an ideogram, labeled 'Ideogram,' showing genomic positions and their categories. It features a blue interactive brush linking to a linear view, which corresponds to chromosome 1. The circular view integrates tracks like 'Putative Driver' and range annotation tracks ('Gain' in sky blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in dark orange), plus a line-connection track visualizing structural variations. Categories such as 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion' are color-coded.

The linear view mirrors the circular tracks, adding a gene annotation track, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation,' and two range annotation tracks. The scatter plot visualizes VCF data, using point positions to indicate mutation distances with subtype-based color coding. Range annotation tracks show 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' with rectangles in yellow and green, while 'Copy Number Variants' track visualizes a CSV file, highlighting quantitative variations with light grey bars.
