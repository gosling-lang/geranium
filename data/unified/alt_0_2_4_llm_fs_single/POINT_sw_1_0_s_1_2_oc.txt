A point chart arranged in a linear layout displays multivec data, visualizing the hg38 genome. The genomic positions are shown along the x-axis, while quantitative expression values corresponding to the 'peak' data field are depicted on the y-axis. The size of each point also represents the 'peak' values. The chart is titled 'Basic Marks: point' with a subtitle 'Tutorial Examples.'
