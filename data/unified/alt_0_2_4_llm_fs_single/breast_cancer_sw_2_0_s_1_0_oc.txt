The visualization is a genomic linear layout displaying various aspects of chromosome 1 using several tracks, each with distinct data and encoding strategies. The first track is an ideogram showing chromosomal bands with colors indicating different staining categories. Following this, a gene annotation track displays directionality with triangles, split by strand colors, indicating genomic positions. Two consecutive tracks represent copy number variations (CNVs) in a tumor, highlighted by rectangles in dark orange and green, signifying specific genomic alterations. The final track shows structural variations with links connecting genomic loci, where colors represent categories like tandem-duplications and translocations. These tracks collectively provide a comprehensive view of chromosomal characteristics and mutations.
