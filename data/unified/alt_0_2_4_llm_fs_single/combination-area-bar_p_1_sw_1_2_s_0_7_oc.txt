A linear visualization displays genomic data across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The visualization consists of two vertical tracks. The top track is a bar chart showing genomic intervals on the x-axis and the minimum and maximum expression values on the y-axis with colored bars. The data is stratified by four samples, each assigned a unique color. The bottom track is an area chart displaying the expression of peaks, also stratified by the four samples in corresponding colors. Both tracks include genomic tooltips for interactive exploration.
