A visualization with circular and linear views displays genomic data of the hg19 assembly. The circular layout showcases an ideogram with distinct bands, illustrating genomic positions and a brush selection linking to a detailed linear view. Overlayed tracks display genomic variations: 'Gain' in blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange. The linear view reveals chromosome 1 with multiple tracks: a detailed ideogram, a 'Putative Driver' text chart, and a 'Point Mutation' scatter plot depicting mutation subtypes. Additional tracks annotate 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' with distinct colors, 'Copy Number Variants' in grey bars, and structural variants like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication' through connecting lines in diverse colors, enhancing the visual stratification of genomic alterations.
