The visualization shows a comparative matrix chart with overlaid tracks representing genomic data for chromosome 10. The first track uses a grey color range to depict quantitative values via color intensity for genomic intervals on both axes, displayed in the lower-left quadrant. The second track uses a Viridis color palette to encode expression values with color intensity, shown in the upper-right quadrant. Both tracks are aligned in a horizontal layout, covering the entire width, with linked axes displaying genomic positions. The visualization dynamically adjusts to screen size, using a responsive layout with a linking ID for synchronized interaction across multiple views.
