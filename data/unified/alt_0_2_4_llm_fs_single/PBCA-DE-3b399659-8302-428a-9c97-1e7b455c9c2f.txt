The visualization consists of two main views: a circular genome overview and a linear detailed view. The circular view includes an ideogram displaying the entire genome with color-coded bands for chromosomal features. Overlaid are tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' which show genomic regions in sky blue and dark orange, respectively. A line-connection track highlights structural variations with diverse colors representing categories such as Translocation and Duplication. This view is linked to the linear view by an interactive brush.

The linear view is focused on chromosome 1, featuring multiple tracks: a detailed ideogram, a labeled 'Putative Driver' track with textual annotations of genetic data, and a 'Point Mutation' scatter plot. This scatter plot uses a vertical axis to indicate mutation distances, with points colored by subtype. The 'Copy Number Variants' track visualizes gene copy variations, and additional tracks display further LOH and Gain annotations. Each track employs various shapes and colors to represent genomic data visually, with tooltips providing detailed insights when interacted with.
