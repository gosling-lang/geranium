The visualization titled "Example: Brushing and Linking" presents two line charts in a linear layout, both derived from a multivec file focused on chromosome 1. The first line chart, colored pink, spans the entire chromosome and features an interactive brush for linking. The second line chart zooms into a specific section between positions 200,000,000 and 220,000,000 on chromosome 1, displayed in purple. This chart has a light steel blue background for emphasis. The charts encode data with lines representing 'peak' values along the y-axis, providing a comparative view of the genomic data.
