The visualization consists of two circular charts arranged horizontally, visualizing genomic data from chromosome 1. The first chart on the left displays an area plot, stratified by four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', with colors corresponding to each category. Each sample is shown in a different colored band representing genomic positions (x-axis) and peak values (y-axis). The right chart shows within-link connections between genomic intervals on chromosome 1, with colors indicating different categories based on the starting positions. The visualization highlights genomic patterns in a circular arrangement for comparison across samples.
