The visualization consists of a circular layout at the top and two linear bar charts below. The circular layout shows genomic data with four samples represented in different colors: blue, orange, green, and red. Genomic intervals are displayed as bar lengths, stratified by rows for each sample. Connections link genomic positions within the circle, with strokes indicating different structural variations such as deletion, inversion, and translocation.

Below, two detailed linear bar charts represent data for chromosomes 5 and 16. Each chart is linked to specific regions on the circular view through interactive brushes. These bar charts display peaks for each sample, maintaining the same color-coding as the circular layout. 

Data sources include multivec and CSV formats, focusing on genomic fields such as position and peak value, enhancing the understanding of genomic variations and structural features across different samples.
