A circular bar chart displays genomic data, focusing on hg38 regions. Bars represent expression values above genomic positions on the x-axis, colored in purple. The circular layout capitalizes on space to comprehensively visualize data, positioned concentrically and indicated through bar height corresponding to values from a vector dataset. The static and highly detailed presentation aligns bars without gaps, highlighting peaks in expression value, suitable for comparative genomic assessments across multiple chromosomes. The centerRadius and alignment features enhance the efficient use of the layout for dense data representation.
