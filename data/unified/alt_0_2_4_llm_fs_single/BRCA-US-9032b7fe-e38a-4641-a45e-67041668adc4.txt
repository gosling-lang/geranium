The visualization presents both circular and linear views connected by an interactive brush. The circular view displays the entire genome with tracks including an ideogram, annotation tracks for potential drivers, copy number gains (blue rectangles), and loss of heterozygosity (orange rectangles). Connections between genomic positions are also shown, categorized by structural variants such as translocations and inversions.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, mirroring the circular view with additional details. It includes tracks for point mutations depicted by colored points, indels in rows for insertions and deletions, and copy number variants visualized as rectangles representing variations in total copy number. The visualization effectively highlights structural genomic changes with color-coded categories, providing a comprehensive genomic overview.
