The visualization is a circular bar chart displaying a multivec file for chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart includes multiple rows representing different samples, each color-coded to distinguish categories. Bars represent genomic positions on the x-axis with expression values on the y-axis. Opacity and scale of bars change based on height thresholds, providing visual context across a range of expression values. The chart specification, originating from Javed et al. (2010), includes a responsive layout that adapts from circular to linear based on aspect ratio, ensuring clarity across different display conditions.
