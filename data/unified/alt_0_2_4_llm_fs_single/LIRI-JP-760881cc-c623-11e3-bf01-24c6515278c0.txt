The visualization includes a circular and linear arrangement linked by an interactive brush, showing genomic data for hg19. The circular layout features an ideogram, annotation tracks, and connection tracks that represent structural variants like translocations and duplications. The linear view further details chromosome 1, including point mutations and copy number variants. The tracks visualize data from files such as CSV and VCF, using encoding like color and shape to represent different genomic features. This provides an interactive and comprehensive overview of genomic variations.
