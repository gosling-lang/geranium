The visualization presents a circular and a linear view, linked via a blue interactive brush in the circular view. The circular view encompasses the entire genome, featuring five tracks: a title 'Ideogram', a point annotation track labeled 'Putative Driver', range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)', and a line-connection track illustrating structural variations. The linear view zooms into chromosome 1, with similar tracks plus additional ones for gene annotation, point mutation scatterplots, and a depiction of copy number variants. The tracks represent data from various genomic files, using shades of grey, blue, and orange to differentiate between data types such as 'Gain' and 'LOH', while the connection lines indicate types of genetic structural variations like 'Translocation' and 'Inversion'.
