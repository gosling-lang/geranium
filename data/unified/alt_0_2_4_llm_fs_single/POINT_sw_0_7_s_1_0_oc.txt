A scatter plot in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, showing the entire genome of hg38. The position and size of points are encoded using the data field named 'peak.' The title is 'Basic Marks: point' and the subtitle is 'Tutorial Examples.' The chart displays genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis.
