A circular and a linear view are aligned vertically. An interactive brush in blue links both views, with the circular view focusing on the entire genome, and the linear view detailing chromosome 1. The circular view contains a structure with multiple tracks: an ideogram, text annotations, and range annotations. Key tracks include 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' showing genomic changes in blue and orange, respectively. A connection track displays structural variations such as 'Translocation' and 'Duplication' with distinct colors. The linear view mirrors these tracks with additional details, including gene annotations, a scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation' visualizing mutation distances, and bar charts for further copy number variations, highlighting genomic insights from CSV and VCF files.
