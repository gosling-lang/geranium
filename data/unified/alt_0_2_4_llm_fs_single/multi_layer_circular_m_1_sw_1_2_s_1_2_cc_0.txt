A circular line chart visualizes multiple time series data, focusing on chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart uses genomic coordinates on the x-axis and quantitative expression values on the y-axis. The visualization consists of multiple layers with varying opacity levels, showcasing a composite of peaks for different samples. Each sample is represented by a distinct color, illustrating various expression patterns. The chart effectively stratifies data by categories and filters out specific entries, such as "sample -," to provide a clear view of relevant data. The design references graphical perception research and ensures data readability through a circular layout.
