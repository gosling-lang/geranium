A Circos plot in a circular layout visualizes genomic data. It includes three tracks: a bar chart, an ideogram, and a link track. The bar chart shows genomic positions with quantitative values in sky blue. The ideogram displays chromosome bands with colors indicating different categories. The link track shows connections between genomic regions, colored based on categorical values associated with the chromosome data. The visualization is static with a centered radius of 0.3, aligning in a stack arrangement. The plot covers the entire genome of hg38, as indicated by the data sources used.
