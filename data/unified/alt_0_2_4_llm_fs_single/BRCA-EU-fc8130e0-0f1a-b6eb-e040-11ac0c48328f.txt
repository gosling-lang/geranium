A circular and linear view are arranged vertically. The circular view contains an ideogram and other tracks including point annotation and range annotation tracks, with a blue interactive brush linking to the linear view. It displays a whole-genome overview, with structural variants represented as connections colored based on categories such as 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' and 'Inversion.' 

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, showing detailed genomic annotations. It includes ideograms, text annotations for 'Putative Driver' genes, and visualizations of point mutations, copy number variants, and structural variants. The scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' visualizes distances between mutations, categorized by base substitution types. Range tracks for 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' are visualized as colored rectangles, highlighting chromosomal regions with significant copy number alterations.
