A circular multi-row bar chart visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. Eight categories spanning from "sample 1" to "sample 8" are presented in rows, excluding "sample -." Each row shows color-coded bars representing quantitative "peak" values. The colors include blue, orange, green, red, purple, brown, and others. The chart layout is circular with inner and outer radii set to 84 and 280, respectively. The chart is designed for a genomic context with no axis on the y-dimension.
