The visualization is a series of linear tracks displaying genomic data along chromosomes 1 to 5. Each chromosome view consists of a multivec area plot and a cytogenetic band ideogram. The multivec area plot shows expression levels across genomic positions, using different colors for samples: blue, orange, green, and red. The ideogram represents cytogenetic bands as rectangles, with colors indicating band density: varying shades from white to black, and special regions marked in purple and maroon for 'gvar' and 'acentric' bands. Axes and text annotations label chromosomal regions, enhancing interpretability. The layout is static and arranged serially with a compact center radius, enabling a comprehensive view across chromosomes in hg38 assembly.
