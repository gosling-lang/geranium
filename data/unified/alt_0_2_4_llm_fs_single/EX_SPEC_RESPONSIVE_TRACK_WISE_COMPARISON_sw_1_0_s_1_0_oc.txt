The image is a visualization consisting of eight individual charts. It features two genomic range annotation tracks with text, which are stratified by rows according to strand categories. These annotation tracks use pink and orange colors for visual encoding. Additionally, six bar charts illustrate expression data across different genomic intervals. These bar charts represent three samples in two different genomic regions, chromosome 12 (chr12: 10,140,000 - 10,200,000) and chromosome 8 (chr8: 127,734,000 - 127,744,000). Each sample is depicted with pink or orange colored bars according to the dataset. The bars indicate quantitative expression values based on peak data. The visualization is linked by interactive responsive views, adjusting elements based on viewer dimensions. This layout facilitates comparative genomic analysis between the samples across different chromosomal regions.
