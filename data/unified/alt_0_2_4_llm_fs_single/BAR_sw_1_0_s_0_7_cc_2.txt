A bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, depicting genomic data from hg38. The chart displays bars based on the 'peak' value for 'sample 1' across genomic intervals on the x-axis, ranging from chromosome 1 to chromosome 22. The y-axis represents quantitative data, with a purple color encoding the bars. The chart is titled 'Basic Marks: bar' with a subtitle 'Tutorial Examples,' and includes detailed labeling for enhanced readability.
