The visualization consists of two vertically arranged scatter plots representing genomic data in a linear layout. Both plots display data across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top scatter plot depicts expression values on the y-axis and genomic positions on the x-axis, with point size and coordinates representing the 'peak' value. The points are color-coded by 'sample' categories, which include 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The second scatter plot is stratified by 'sample' categories along rows with the same encoding attributes. Both charts include tooltips for genomic positions and peak values, enhancing the interpretability of genomic variation patterns. Overall, this visualization facilitates a comparative analysis between different sample datasets across the specified genomic interval.
