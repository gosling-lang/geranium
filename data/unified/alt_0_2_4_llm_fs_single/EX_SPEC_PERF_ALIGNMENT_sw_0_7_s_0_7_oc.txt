A genomic visualization consisting of two linear charts titled "Smoother Zoom" with a subtitle "Rather than redrawing every element at every frame, we can scale existing elements." The top chart, "New Approach: Stretching Tiles," and the bottom chart, "Original Approach," both cover the genomic interval from position 350 to 396. Both tracks use colored rectangles to encode categorical genomic data based on the 'base' field from a CSV file, utilizing a color range including red, green, purple, and orange. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while each row is stratified by the 'name' field, with additional text annotations in black based on these fields. The visualization explores a smoother zoom interaction, with stretching graphics enabled in the top chart, enhancing the visual scaling effect.
