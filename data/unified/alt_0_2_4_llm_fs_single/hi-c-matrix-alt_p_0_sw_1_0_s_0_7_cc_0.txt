A Hi-C matrix visualization with a linear layout, featuring overlaid tracks. The genomic data spans from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000, covering various chromosomes. 

1. **Matrix Track**: Displays genomic interactions with both x- and y-axes representing genomic positions, encoded with a color gradient from hot to light for intensity. 

2. **Vertical Lines Annotation**: Red vertical lines mark specific genomic positions on the x-axis.

3. **Horizontal Lines Annotation**: Purple horizontal lines mark genomic positions on the y-axis.

4. **Genomic Bars and Points**: Overlaid bars and points represent quantitative data across specific genomic regions. The points are sky blue, with sizes indicating expression values and stroke detailing categorical differences. 

Both color and stroke effectively differentiate between categories, while opacity is utilized to layer visual elements without obscuring details. The visualization is titled "Hi-C Matrix" with the subtitle "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations."
