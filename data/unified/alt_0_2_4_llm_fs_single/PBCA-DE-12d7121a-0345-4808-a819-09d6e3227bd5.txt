The visualization presents a comprehensive genomic analysis in a hybrid layout combining circular and linear views. The circular view encompasses the entire genome from hg19 assembly, featuring an ideogram with category-specific coloring and labeled genomic sections. Notably, interactive brushing in the ideogram links to the linear view, highlighting specific genomic regions.

The circular layout further includes a "Putative Driver" text track, two range annotation tracks labeled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and a line-connection track. The range annotations are visualized with blue and orange rectangles, respectively, while the connections depict structural variations, such as Translocation, Duplication, and Deletion, encoded by distinct colors and strokes.

Below, the linear view zooms into chromosome 1, maintaining similar tracksâ€”ideogram, text, range annotations, and connections. Additional linear tracks display gene annotations, a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation," and detailed variant data across "Insertion," "Deletion," and "Copy Number Variants" tracks. The scatter plot visualizes mutations with points colored by subtype, reflecting data diversity. Overall, the visualization efficiently merges circular and linear perspectives to facilitate detailed genomic exploration.
