The visualization consists of a circular view and two horizontal bar charts. The circular layout displays genomic intervals for multiple chromosomes with a stacked arrangement. Each row represents a sample and is colored differently to distinguish between 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Connections between genomic positions are shown within the circle using different strokes to represent categories such as deletion, inversion, and translocation.

Below, two horizontal bar charts provide detailed views of specific chromosomes, chr5 and chr16. Each bar chart is linked to the circular view by interactive brushes. The bars are stratified by sample categories and colored accordingly. Quantitative expression levels are depicted on the y-axis, providing an insight into genomic data distribution for the selected regions.
