The visualization is a comparative genomic matrix with overlaid tracks in a linear horizontal arrangement, focusing on chromosome 10. The matrix representation allows the visualization of genomic intervals on both axes. There are two tracks within each overlay: one visualizes data in grayscale and the other in pink, both encoding expression values through color intensity. Each matrix track is encoded using a quantitative field, showing the genomes' expression values. The layout is responsive, adapting based on screen width, with a linking ID for consistent navigation between overlays, ensuring alignment across shared genomic domains. The range of pink and grey coloring provides a qualitative representation of data, displaying matrix values in the lower-left and upper-right sections respectively.
