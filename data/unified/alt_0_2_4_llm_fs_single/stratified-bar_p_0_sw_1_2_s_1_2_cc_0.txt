A linear bar chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying genomic data for chromosome 1 within the interval 1 to 3,000,500. The chart is stratified into four rows corresponding to 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each row's bars represent peak values, with respective colors of blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis shows genomic position, and the y-axis indicates quantitative peak values. Additionally, tooltips provide detailed information on start and end positions, peak values, and sample categories.
