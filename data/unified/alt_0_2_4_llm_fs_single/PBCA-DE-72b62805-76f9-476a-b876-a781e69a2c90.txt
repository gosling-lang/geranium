A comprehensive genomic visualization is presented with both circular and linear layouts. The circular view displays the complete hg19 genome as an ideogram, with concentric tracks illustrating genomic annotations and variations. These tracks include 'Gain' in sky blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in dark orange. Connections between genomic sites highlight structural variations like Translocations and Duplications, colored according to the specific variation class.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, depicted with tracks for gene annotations, point mutations, and copy number variants (CNVs). Point mutations are plotted as a scatter plot with colors indicating different mutation subtypes. CNVs are illustrated as bars with height representing the quantitative value of copy number, with a specific track labeled 'Copy Number Variants.' Interactive elements such as tooltips and a genome-wide brush in the circular view allow for detailed examination and cross-referencing between the views.
