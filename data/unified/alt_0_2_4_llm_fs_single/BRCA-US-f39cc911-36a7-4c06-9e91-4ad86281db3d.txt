This visualization features a circular view linked to a linear view, both representing genomic data from the hg19 assembly. The circular view includes an ideogram, a text annotation track named "Putative Driver," and two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" with blue and orange rectangles respectively. A connection track illustrates structural variations such as Translocation, Duplication, Deletion, Inversion (TtT), and Inversion (HtH) with different colors.

The ideogram serves as a navigational aid with an interactive brush linked to the linear view, which focuses on chromosome 1. This linear view contains a similar set of tracks as the circular view, in addition to a track for "Point Mutation," displaying a VCF file as a scatter plot where points are colored by mutation subtype (e.g., C>A, C>G). There are tracks for "Insertion" and "Deletion" with respective rows and color coding, as well as a "Copy Number Variants" track showing quantitative data with grey rectangles.

Both views aim to provide a comprehensive multi-dimensional representation of genomic variations, allowing for detailed exploration of the genome's structural variants.
