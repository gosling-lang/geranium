The visualization consists of five stacked linear tracks. The first track is an ideogram showing chromosome 1 with regions color-coded to indicate various staining categories. Right and left triangles are annotated, indicating chromosome arms. The second track features genomic position annotations with directional arrows representing gene strands, colored blue and orange for positive and negative strands respectively. Two subsequent tracks display genomic ranges: one with purple rectangles indicating minor copy number variations, and another with green rectangles denoting major genomic variations in tumor data. The final track visualizes structural variant connections with curved lines colored based on categories such as "tandem-duplication," "translocation," "deletion," and "inversion." This figure provides a comprehensive view of genomic features and variations in chromosome 1.
