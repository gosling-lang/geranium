A visualization titled "Rule Mark" with the subtitle "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines" features a linear layout representing genomic data. The main track is a bar chart showing genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Bars are colored sky blue, representing genomic data. Overlaid are two sets of rules; the first set includes horizontal and vertical green lines with varying stroke widths based on quantitative values, while the second set consists of dashed pink vertical lines. The chart is layered and uses assembly hg38, with data sourced from a multivec file and JSON values.
