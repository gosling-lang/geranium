A visualization with a linear layout displays genomic data across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. It consists of two main tracks stacked vertically. The top track is a scatter plot that shows expression values with dots, where each dot's position on the y-axis represents a quantitative 'peak' value. Different colors signify distinct categories labeled 'sample 1' through 'sample 4'.

The bottom track is an area chart, stratified by rows for each sample category, displaying the same genomic range. The area under curves in the area chart highlights the quantitative 'peak' values, with row colors corresponding to different samples. Tooltip information includes genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample names. The visualization is designed to provide detailed insights into variations within specified genomic regions of chromosome 1 in a visually distinct manner.
