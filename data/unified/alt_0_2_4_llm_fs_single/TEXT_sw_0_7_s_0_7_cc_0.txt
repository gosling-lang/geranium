A linear text chart displays genomic data with the title "Basic Marks: Text" and the subtitle "Tutorial Examples." The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis shows quantitative values labeled with text. Each character corresponds to a base ('A', 'T', 'G', 'C') colored in different shades: blue for 'A', orange for 'T', green for 'G', and red for 'C'. The data is rendered using a multivec format, indicating categories for each base type with a bin size of 16. The text stroke width is set to zero, creating a smooth appearance. The design is static with no interactive elements, ensuring clarity and focus on the dataset representation, aligning with the genome assembly hg38.
