The visualization is a circular layout titled "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements." It features multiple elements arranged concentrically. The innermost layer consists of green bars indicating expression levels on the y-axis, mapped against genomic intervals on the x-axis. Surrounding this is a layer displaying a chromosomal ideogram in multicolored rectangles, representing different categorical stains. A prominent feature is the network of connecting lines, or links, displaying relationships between genomic positions. These links are shaded in gray and purple, indicating different categorical connections based on genomic data filtered from a CSV source. The design emphasizes parallel arrangement, with data aligned horizontally and stacked. The entire visualization is static, optimizing for visual clarity in displaying genomic relationships and interactions.
