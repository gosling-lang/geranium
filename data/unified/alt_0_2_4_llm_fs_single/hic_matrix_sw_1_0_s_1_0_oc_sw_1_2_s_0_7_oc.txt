The visualization is a linear, matrix-based heat map representing data from a genome. The axes correspond to genomic intervals ranging from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 on both the x- and y-axes. Each cell in the grid encodes quantitative expression values using varying shades of gray, providing a visual representation of the data within this genomic range of the hg38 assembly. Rectangular marks are used to illustrate the data, and the x- and y-axis are labeled with genomic positions, highlighting intersections between different chromosomes. The layout is horizontal, and the map is static without interaction-specific elements.
