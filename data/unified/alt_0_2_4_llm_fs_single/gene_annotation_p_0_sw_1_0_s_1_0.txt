A linear genomic visualization displays gene annotations within chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The layout comprises six arranged tracks, each corresponding to different studies, including IGV, Corces et al., HiGlass, Cyverse-QUBES, and GmGDV. These tracks illustrate genomic features using various marks such as text annotations, rectangles, and triangles. The IGV track utilizes navy blue text and rectangles, while Corces et al. use red and blue for differentiating strands. HiGlass employs triangulated patterns to denote strand directionality in blue and red hues. Cyverse-QUBES and GmGDV tracks use gray tones for structural annotations. Each track is orientated horizontally, stratified by rows categorizing strands, enhancing the view of genomic intervals and gene positions.
