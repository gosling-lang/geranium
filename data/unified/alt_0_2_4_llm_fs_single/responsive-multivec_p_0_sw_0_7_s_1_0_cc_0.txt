The visualization is a bar chart with a linear layout, showcasing a multivec file. It spans chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The data is stratified by 16 categories, excluding a specific unwanted category filtered out. Each category is represented by a distinct color in the bar chart. The y-axis encodes quantitative values, specifically 'peak', with various scales depending on the height of the track. The layout adapts to changes in size, with specified opacity levels for different zoom thresholds, ensuring clear visibility. The chart aims to allow exploration of genomic data visually across multiple rows.
