The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view aligned vertically. The circular view showcases the human genome (hg19), featuring an ideogram and multiple annotation tracks. The ideogram, colored based on staining, includes a blue interactive brush linking to the linear view. Inside the circular view, there are tracks displaying genes, structural variations, and copy number variations. Gene annotations are shown with black text, while LOH (Loss of Heterozygosity) and Gain tracks are highlighted using dark orange and sky blue, respectively. Connections between genomic positions are illustrated with lines of varying colors, indicating different structural variants like 'Translocation', 'Duplication', and 'Inversion'. The linear view, focusing on chromosome 1, expands on these details with additional tracks: a gene annotation track with triangles and rectangles in grey tones, a genomic point annotation track titled 'Point Mutation' showing mutations in various colors, and copy number variations displayed in grey rectangles. The alignment of circular and linear views facilitates detailed examination of specific genomic regions from a broad genome-wide perspective.
