The visualization consists of three linear genomic tracks arranged vertically, each showing a different interval of chromosome 13. The tracks are titled "HiGlass" and feature a gene annotation track and a ClinVar track.

1. **Gene Annotation Track**: Displays gene structures with directionality indicated by triangles and lines across different strands. Genes are labeled with their names, and exons are shown as rectangles. The track is stratified by strand, with "+" strands colored blue and "-" strands colored red.

2. **ClinVar Track**: Represents variant significance with bars and points. Bars indicate overall significance categories, with "Pathogenic" in magenta and "Likely benign" in green among others. Points overlay the bars to emphasize individual variant significance, and colors match the significance categories.

The visualization effectively illustrates gene structures and variant significances across the specified genomic regions on chromosome 13, employing color and layout to distinguish between categories and strands.
