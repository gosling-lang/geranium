A linear link visualization displays genomic connections within chromosome 1 of the hg38 assembly, represented by arcs. The data is sourced from a CSV file regarding segmental duplications. The x and x1 axes, spanning genomic start and end positions, segment the arcs, which are colored in olive green for clear distinction. The chart is titled 'Basic Marks: Link' and subtitled 'Tutorial Examples.'
