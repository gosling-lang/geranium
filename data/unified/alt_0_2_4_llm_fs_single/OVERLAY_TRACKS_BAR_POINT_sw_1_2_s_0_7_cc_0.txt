The visualization is a linear genomic track displaying data from the ClinVar database for chromosome 3. It overlays bars and points to represent variant significance across genomic intervals. The x-axis represents genomic positions, starting and ending with specific fields, while the y-axis categorizes data by clinical significance, spanning seven categories from "Pathogenic" to "Benign." Bars and points vary in color and stroke depending on the significance category, using a palette of orange, black, and teal shades. The layout includes an interactive legend indicating category colors and opacities. The visualization is titled "Example: Overlay Tracks" and uses a nominal data type to encode significance.
