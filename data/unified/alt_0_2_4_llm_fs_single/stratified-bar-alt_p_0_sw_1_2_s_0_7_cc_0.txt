A multi-row bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 1 between 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. The chart consists of four rows representing 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each displayed in distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. Genomic positions are plotted on the x-axis with bar height denoting expression values. The min and max of the expression values are represented on the y and ye-axes. An interactive legend indicates the color mapping of samples.
