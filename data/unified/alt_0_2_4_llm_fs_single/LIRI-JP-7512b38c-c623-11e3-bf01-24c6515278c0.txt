A circular ideogram and a horizontal linear view are combined to explore the human genome (assembly hg19). The circular view includes five tracks: an ideogram, a putative driver annotation using text, two range tracks, and a line-connection track visualizing structural variants. The text annotation track contains genes with prefixes that mark biallelic status. Gain and Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) are highlighted in blue and orange. The line-connection track connects genomic positions, color-coded by structural variant type, including duplication, deletion, and inversions.

The linear view aligns with chromosome 1 and expands on genomic details with nine tracks, featuring a comparable ideogram and textual annotations as the circular view. Additional tracks present gene annotations, a scatter plot of point mutations, indel annotations, copy number variants, and extensive use of color to differentiate data points. The scatter plot showcases point mutations, colored by subtype. Rectangular tracks display insertions, deletions, and copy number variants, with varied hues for visual clarity. Interactive elements and tooltips enhance the exploration of intricate genomic data.
