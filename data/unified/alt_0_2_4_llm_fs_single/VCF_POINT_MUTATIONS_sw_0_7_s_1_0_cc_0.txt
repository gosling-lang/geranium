A scatter plot in a linear layout visualizes point mutations from a VCF file. The x-axis displays genomic positions, while the y-axis represents the logged distances to previous mutations. Points are encoded with various colors indicating mutation subtypes, such as C>A, C>G, C>T, T>A, T>C, and T>G. The layout is vertical with a center radius of 0.8, and dimensions are 420x160. The title "Point mutations from a VCF file" is displayed above the chart.
