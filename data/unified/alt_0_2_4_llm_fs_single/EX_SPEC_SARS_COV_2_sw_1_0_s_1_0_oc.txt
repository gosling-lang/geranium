The figure provides a linear visualization of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sourced from the WashU Virus Genome Browser, NCBI, and GISAID, covering the entire reference genome NC_045512.2. The top track shows gene annotations, with genes represented by navy blue rectangles, each accompanied by a white line and black text labeling gene symbols. A linked interactive brush enables detailed exploration of specific genome regions. Below, the "S Protein Annotation" displays key protein domains such as the receptor-binding domain and cleavage sites, each with distinct color coding. The sequence track visualizes the base composition of the genome, with bars representing counts for bases A, T, G, and C. The final track illustrates TRS-L-Dependent Recombination Events within the genome, depicted by navy blue connections across intervals. This comprehensive layout offers a detailed insight into genomic features and annotations of SARS-CoV-2.
