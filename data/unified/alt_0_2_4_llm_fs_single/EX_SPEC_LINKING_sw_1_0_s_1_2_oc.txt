A visualization titled "Visual Linking" demonstrates genomic data using a circular and linear layout. The main feature is the interactive linking between the two chart types, facilitated by a brush tool that allows users to manipulate visible data ranges. At the top, a circular bar chart shows data across chromosome 1, with multiple samples represented in various colors. These colors correspond to different categories. Each sample's expression values are visualized through bars. The circular chart includes a brush that interacts with the linear bar chart below, allowing dynamic updates in the detailed view. The linear chart further analyzes chromosome 1, focusing on the region between positions 160,000,000 and 200,000,000. It presents the same categorical data, aligned to provide continuity in visual representation, emphasizing both genomic positions and quantitative peak values. The overall arrangement is vertical, showcasing both high-level and detailed genomic insights effectively.
