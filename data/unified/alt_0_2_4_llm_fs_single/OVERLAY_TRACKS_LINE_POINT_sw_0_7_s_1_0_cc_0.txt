### Description

The visualization is a linear layout combining a line chart and scatter plot to display a multivec file. The title is "Example: Overlayed Tracks", showcasing genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. It consists of four rows, titled 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each with a distinctive color: blue, orange, green, and red respectively. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis encodes quantitative 'peak' values. Data points are visualized as lines with overlaying points, where point sizes vary according to 'peak' measurements. The color of lines and points distinguish different samples, enhancing categorical differentiation across the tracks.
