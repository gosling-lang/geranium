A linear, multi-row bar chart visualizes genomic data across chromosome 1, spanning the interval from 1 to 3,000,500. Each row represents a different sample, named 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', colored in blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The x-axis displays genomic positions, while the y-axis quantifies the 'peak' values. The chart is stratified by sample categories, with a legend indicating the sample names and colors. This visualization uses a multivec format sourced from a specified URL.
