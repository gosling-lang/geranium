A linear bar chart visualization displays a multivec file for chromosome 12, ranging from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000 base pairs. The chart illustrates genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis through stratified rows corresponding to specific samples. Each row, representing a sample, is colored uniquely with options such as blue, orange, and green, reflecting data categories. The chart adapts to changes in height, modifying opacity and visibility based on specified thresholds. Categories for expression values are color-coded within different visibility settings, offering quantitative insight across various genomic scales.
