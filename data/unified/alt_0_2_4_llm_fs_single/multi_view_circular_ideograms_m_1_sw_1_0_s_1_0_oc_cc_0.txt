A circular visualization displays genomic data from chromosome 1 in two tracks. The outer track features a line chart mapping the 'peak' values across genomic positions, with each line colored based on the 'sample' categories, including 'sample 1' to 'sample 4.' The inner track is an ideogram depicting chromosome segments in colored rectangles, indicating different 'Stain' categories such as 'gneg', 'gpos25', 'gpos50', 'gpos75', 'gpos100', and 'gvar.' This layout effectively highlights genomic variations and chromosomal features.
