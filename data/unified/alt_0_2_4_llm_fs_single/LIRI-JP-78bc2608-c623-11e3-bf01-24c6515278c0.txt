A multi-layer visualization composed of circular and linear layouts showcases genomic data from hg19. The circular layout displays various tracks, including a color-coded chromosomal ideogram, text annotations for putative drivers, and range annotations for 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' using blue and orange rectangles. A line-connection track visualizes structural variations classified by types like translocations and duplications. The linear layout beneath focuses on chromosome 1, mirroring the circular view with additional detail. It includes an ideogram, text annotations, mutation scatter plots, and tracks for copy number variants. The scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' uses colored points to denote mutation subtypes, while the CNV track uses gray rectangles to represent copy number changes. An interactive brush links the circular and linear views for detailed exploration.
