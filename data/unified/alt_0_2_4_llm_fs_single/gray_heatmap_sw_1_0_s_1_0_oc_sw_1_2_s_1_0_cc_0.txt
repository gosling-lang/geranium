A genomic heatmap in a linear layout visualizes a matrix file, displaying interactions between different genomic intervals within the human genome assembly hg38. The x-axis and y-axis both show genomic positions, with grid lines marking chromosome boundaries. The expression values are encoded in color intensity using a hot color scheme. This static, horizontal visualization has a width of 510 pixels and a height of 430 pixels.
