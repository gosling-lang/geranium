The visualization displays a linear layout focusing on chromosome 1. It includes an ideogram showing chromosomal bands, with alternating colors indicating different genomic categories. The next track illustrates gene positions using triangles to denote gene direction and strand. The gene track is stratified by strand direction with distinct colors for each strand. Two subsequent tracks highlight copy number variations using red and green rectangles to mark genomic intervals. The final track displays structural variations with curved lines connecting different genomic regions, categorized by distinct colors representing 'tandem-duplication', 'translocation', 'deletion', and 'inversion'.
