A linear visualization displays genomic information of chromosome 1 using the hg38 assembly. The first track is a colorful ideogram with gray outlines, which marks different chromosome bands, indicated by colors based on the 'Stain' field. Adjacent rows depict gene annotations, with blue and orange triangles indicating gene orientation. Two sequential tracks show copy number variations from a CSV file, where green and pink rectangles represent different levels of copy number variation in tumor samples. The final track visualizes genomic rearrangements as line connections across the genome, with different colors indicating various structural variation classes such as tandem duplication and translocation.
