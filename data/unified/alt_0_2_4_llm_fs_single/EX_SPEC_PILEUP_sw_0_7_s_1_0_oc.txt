The visualization consists of two aligned tracks in a linear layout. The top track is a bar chart representing sequence coverage data from a BAM file. The x-axis displays genomic intervals from chromosome 1, specifically between positions 136,750 and 139,450. The y-axis demonstrates quantitative coverage data, and the bars are colored silver.

The bottom track shows a pileup representation of the BAM file using rectangles. It is stratified into rows for various categories of structural variations, each identified by a unique color. These categories include normal reads, deletions, inversions, duplications, and more. The track also features interactive tooltips, providing detailed information for each genomic segment, like insertion size and strand information. The entire visualization is titled "Pileup Track Using BAM Data," with dimensions of 875x710 pixels.
