The visualization is a horizontal linear layout focusing on chromosome 3, between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. It features a vertical arrangement of interactive tracks from the IGV data source. Each track contains gene annotations displayed as text labels and rectangles in navy blue, stratified by strand direction (positive and negative). White triangles within the rules indicate gene direction, either pointing right for positive strands or left for negative strands. The title of the visualization is 'IGV'. The genomic data is represented using a genomic axis at the top, highlighting intervals along chromosome 3.
