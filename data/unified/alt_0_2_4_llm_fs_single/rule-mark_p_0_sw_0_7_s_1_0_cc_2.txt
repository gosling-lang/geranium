A linear bar chart displays genomic data across the entire genome (hg38 assembly), featuring overlaying tracks with bar marks and rule marks. The chart titled "Rule Mark" with the subtitle "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines" uses a dashed style for annotations. The sky-blue bars represent expression values over specific intervals on the horizontal genome axis. Rules, illustrated as vertical lines in sky blue, highlight positions on chromosomes 2, 5, and 10, with line thickness indicating value magnitude. The visualization integrates quantitative data with a multivec file and JSON data for comprehensive genomic analysis.
