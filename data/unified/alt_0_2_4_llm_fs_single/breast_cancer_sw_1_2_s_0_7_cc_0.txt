A linear layout visualization over chromosome 1 shows multiple genomic tracks. The first track is an ideogram with colored rectangles and labeled with chromosome bands. The colors represent different stains, visualized with right and left triangles to indicate orientations. The second track displays genes as triangles, stratified by strand into positive (blue) and negative (orange) orientations. The third and fourth tracks are bar charts illustrating copy number variations. Blue rectangles indicate regions with minor copy number zero, while green rectangles show total copy numbers in a specified range. The final track is a genomic connection chart with curves representing structural variations such as tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions, colored differently for each category.
