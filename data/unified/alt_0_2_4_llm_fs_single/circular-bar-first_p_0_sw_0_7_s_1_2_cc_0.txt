A circular bar chart in a vertical arrangement visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The layout is static with a center radius of 0.5. The data is represented by different categories, including 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each colored in blue, orange, green, and red respectively. The bars encode expression values along the y-axis, while the genomic position is shown on the x-axis with annotations for grid lines. The chart includes tooltips displaying start and end positions, value, and sample information, enhancing interactivity. The visualization uses assembly hg38.
