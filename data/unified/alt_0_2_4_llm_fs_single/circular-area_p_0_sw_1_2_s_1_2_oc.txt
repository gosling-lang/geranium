A circular area chart represents genomic data on chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The chart is divided into rows, each corresponding to a distinct sample. Four samples, labeled 'sample 1' through 'sample 4', are displayed with areas filled in different colors. The y-values display quantitative data mapped from the multivec file, represented as the height of the areas. The chart is interactive, featuring tooltips that reveal information about the genomic start and end positions, the quantitative values at those positions, and the sample identification. Assembly is based on hg38 with a vertical arrangement in circular layout.
