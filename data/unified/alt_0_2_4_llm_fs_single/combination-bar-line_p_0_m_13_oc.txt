The visualization consists of two genomic tracks in a linear layout, focusing on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a line chart displaying quantitative expression data from four samples, differentiated by color. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis shows peak values. The bottom track combines bar and line charts, stratifying data into rows for each sample. The color of lines and bars indicates sample categories, providing a comparative expression overview. Both tracks offer tooltips for detailed quantitative and categorical data insights.
