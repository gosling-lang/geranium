A linear visualization on chromosome 1 between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000 showcases seven tracks, combining rectangle and connection elements. The chart is divided into intervals along the x-axis, where each track represents a distinct dataset type from a CSV source. The rectangles in the first track are displayed in green, indicating some data characteristic. Connection links are color-coded in sky blue and green, portraying interactions between genomic regions. Purple rectangles further categorize data within this genomic interval. The opacity of elements is set at 0.15, with a stroke color of dark olive green for enhanced delineation. Tooltip functionality reveals genomic start and end positions in green.
