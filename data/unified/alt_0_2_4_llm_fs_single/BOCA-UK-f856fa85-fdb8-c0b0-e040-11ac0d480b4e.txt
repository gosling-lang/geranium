The visualization consists of a circular and a linear genomic view arranged vertically. A blue interactive brush in the circular view links the two views. The circular view provides an overview of the whole genome, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. The circular view includes tracks such as an ideogram, annotations, and a connection track. The linear view shows detailed annotations, including point mutations and copy number variations. Categories like 'Gain,' 'Loss of Heterozyosity (LOH),' and structural variations are highlighted using distinct color schemes. A 'Copy Number Variants' track is prominently featured with gray color coding.
