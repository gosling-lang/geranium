A linear bar chart visualizes a multivec file spanning chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The chart is organized vertically with a layout center radius of 0.8. It has four horizontal tracks, each representing different rows labeled 'sample 1' through 'sample 4'. Bars in the chart are colored based on the sample categories, with a color legend displayed on the right. The x-axis shows the genomic positions, while the y-axis, labeled 'peak', represents the quantitative data. The tooltip provides additional details, including start and end genomic positions and peak values.
