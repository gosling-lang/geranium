A dual-layer scatter plot in a vertical linear layout visualizes a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track displays expression values as points, with the x-axis representing the genome (chr1) and the y-axis representing the quantitative "peak" values. The size of the points indicates "peak" magnitude, and their color reflects different "sample" categoriesâ€”blue, orange, green, and red. The bottom track is stratified by rows per sample, maintaining similar visual encodings. Tooltips provide additional details, including genomic start and end positions. Both tracks utilize opacity for overlapping points, enhancing clarity.
