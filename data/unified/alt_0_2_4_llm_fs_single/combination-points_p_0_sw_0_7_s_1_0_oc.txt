The visualization consists of two scatter plots arranged vertically, depicting genomic data for chromosome 1 in a linear layout. The x-axis represents genomic positions between 1 and 3,000,500. Both plots use point marks to display expression values on the y-axis, with point size encoding the magnitude of the "peak" values. Points are stratified by rows and colored according to four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Colors differ for each category, enhancing visual distinction. Both plots include a legend indicating category colors, and the opacity of points is set to 0.5 to enhance data layering visibility. Tooltip functionality is provided, showing detailed information about genomic positions, peak values, and sample categories in response to user interaction.
