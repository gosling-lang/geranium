A linear visualization of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is presented with a focus on key genomic elements. The layout includes gene annotations, protein domains, sequence composition, and recombination events. The visualization starts with an overview track showing gene regions for NC_045512.2, depicted in pink and purple rectangles, with text labels in sky blue. A separate track titled 'S Protein Annotation' overlays colored rectangles representing various protein domains such as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and heptad repeats, stratified by rows. Another track, 'NC_045512.2 Sequence', displays the sequence composition using colored bars for nucleotides, and the text labels are in white. The recombination events are illustrated through connections below these tracks, represented by curved lines in green and blue. The title and subtitle indicate the data sources: WashU Virus Genome Browser, NCBI, and GISAID.
