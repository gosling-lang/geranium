**Description**: 

The visualization is a genomic bar chart in a linear layout, showcasing a multivec file. It displays the sequence of chromosomes with a focus on semantic zooming. The title is "Example: Semantic Zooming," and the subtitle notes that text marks indicating base pairs will appear upon zooming in. The x-axis represents genomic positions across various chromosomes, while the y-axis does not have an explicit measurement as axes are set to none. The data is encoded using four colors - blue, orange, green, and red - to represent the base categories 'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C', respectively. A semantic zoom feature dynamically reveals text labels for base pairs by filtering out count values of zero and showing relevant text during close-up views. The chart dimensions are 960 pixels wide and 96 pixels high, providing an interactive insight into genomic data with emphasis on zoom-level transformations.
