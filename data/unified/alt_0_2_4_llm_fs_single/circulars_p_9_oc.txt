A circular layout visualization demonstrates diverse visual encoding methods using the genome of chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. It features eight charts: a circular area chart, a chart with genomic connections, a combination of line and scatter plots, two bar charts, two scatter plots, and a heat map. Each chart is stratified by categories labeled 'sample 1' to 'sample 4,' with colors representing these categories. The area chart uses color intensity to show genomic expression, while connections in the second chart reveal structural variations. Line and scatter plots display expresi√≥n values through lines and point size. Bar charts show quantitative data as colored bars. Scatter plots depict values using point size and color, and the heat map encodes data intensity through color variation. Each view offers interactive tooltip details for genomic positions, sample categories, and expression values. The title is "Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts," and the subtitle is "Gosling provides diverse visual encoding methods in circular layouts."
