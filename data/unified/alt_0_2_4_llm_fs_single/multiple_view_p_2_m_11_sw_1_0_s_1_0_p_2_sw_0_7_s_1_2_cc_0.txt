The visualization titled "Visual Linking" consists of three interconnected charts. The top left chart is a circular line chart displaying genomic intervals on chromosome 1, with expression values depicted by lines, stratified by categories and colored accordingly. A brush allows interaction, linking this chart to the others. The top right chart is an area chart, showing genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression on the y-axis. It is also stratified by categories, with areas colored to differentiate them. The bottom chart, a scatter plot, focuses on chromosome 1, specifically between 160,000,000 and 200,000,000 base pairs. Points represent expression values, categorized and colored similarly. The charts are arranged vertically, enabling interactive exploration of genomic data linked by brushes, facilitating detailed views of selected regions.
