A heat map in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, depicting chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The expression values are encoded using color intensity and stratified by four samplesâ€”'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4.' Each row represents a sample, and the genomic positions are on the x-axis. The color intensity varies quantitatively with the 'peak' value field, providing a visual representation of data intensity for each genomic segment.
