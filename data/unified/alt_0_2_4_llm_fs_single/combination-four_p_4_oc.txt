The visualization consists of four distinct tracks arranged vertically in a linear layout, highlighting genomic data across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. 

1. **Scatter Plot**: Displays expression values for 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', using genomic positions along the x-axis. Each category is represented by different colored points where size correlates with expression value ('peak'). The transparency of the points is set to 0.5 to show overlapping data.

2. **Bar Chart**: Illustrates minimum ('peak_min') and maximum ('peak_max') expression values for the samples, represented by bars. The genomic positions define the x-intervals, stratified by category with bars colored according to sample.

3. **Heat Map**: Encodes expression data through color intensity, presenting a bin size of 4. This track stratifies rows by sample, using a gradient color scale to indicate variations in peak values.

4. **Overlay Chart (Line and Scatter Plot)**: Combines lines and points to show expression trends with lines indicating changes and point sizes conveying expression magnitude ('peak'). Different sample categories are marked by color.

The comprehensive use of multivec data allows for the representation of multiple samples and their respective genomic expressions, emphasizing trends and variations within specified genomic intervals.
