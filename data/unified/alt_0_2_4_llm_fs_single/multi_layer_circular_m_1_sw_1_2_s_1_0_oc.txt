A circular line chart visualizes genomic data for chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The chart uses multiple overlaid tracks, each representing a different sample, displaying quantitative "peak" values along the y-axis. The chart features 16 samples with distinct colors, omitting a specific category labeled "sample -." The domain of y-values ranges from 0 to 0.01, with separate tracks subdivided into smaller y-domains to highlight variations in data density. The interactive design allows for detailed exploration, ensuring accurate graphical perception referenced from Javed et al., TVCG 2010.
