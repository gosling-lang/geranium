The circular heatmap visualization titled "Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts" with the subtitle "Heatmap" showcases genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The inner to outer segments are stratified by categories, specifically rows, representing samples 1 through 4. The data is visualized using a multivec file in a circular layout, with hue intensity indicating quantitative expression levels. Each colored segment corresponds to a genomic interval with specific peak values, marked by color gradients for visual significance. The chart remains static, employing a defined center radius and utilizing a dark-to-light color palette to illustrate data variance.
