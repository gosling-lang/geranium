This visualization is a heat map in a linear layout, representing genomic data from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 base pairs in the hg38 assembly. The data is structured as a matrix and is displayed as rectangles whose color intensity corresponds to quantitative values, using a 'hot' color scheme. Chromosomes are shown along both the x-axis and y-axis, with intervals marked on each. The width and height of the visualization are both set to 600 pixels, creating a square grid that provides a detailed view of genomic interactions and variations in the specified range.
