The visualization presents a comprehensive genomic analysis using both circular and linear layouts. At the top, a circular ideogram depicts the full genome, distinguished by chromosome bands colored in varying shades representing distinct categories. Integrated tracks display annotations such as 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' indicated by sky-blue and orange rectangles, respectively. A within-link track visualizes genomic connections with lines colored according to structural variations like 'Translocation' and 'Inversion.'

Below, the linear view focuses on chromosome 1, displaying detailed annotations. An ideogram with chromosome bands bridges an interactive view to other charts. The 'Putative Driver' track uses text annotations to signify gene mutations, stratified into rows based on categories. A scatter plot labeled 'Point Mutation' illustrates mutation distances, utilizing multi-colored points to denote mutation types. The detailed layout further includes a copy number variant track and tracks for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion,' rendering genomic intervals as gray rectangles. The use of a blue interactive brush in the circular view allows synchronized exploration between views, enhancing the investigation of genomic data.
