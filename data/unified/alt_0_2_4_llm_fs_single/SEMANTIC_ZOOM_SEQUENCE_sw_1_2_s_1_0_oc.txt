The visualization is a bar chart set in a linear layout, illustrating sequence data across multiple chromosomes. Titled "Example: Semantic Zooming," it demonstrates how text marks indicating base pairs appear upon zooming in. Each bar represents expression values of genomic positions on the x-axis. The y-axis reveals quantitative measures, with bars colored to indicate different nucleotide categories: adenine (A) in yellow, thymine (T) in orange, guanine (G) in green, and cytosine (C) in blue. White text will overlay on the bars when zoomed, representing non-zero base counts. The layout is interactive, allowing users to explore base-level details as they zoom closer. The subtitle explains that text marks are visible upon zooming in, enhancing the detailed genomic analysis experience.
