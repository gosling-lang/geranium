A circular bar chart visualizes the genomic data from a vector file. The layout is stacked with bars representing expression values aligned on a circular axis showing the entire genome (hg38 assembly). The x-axis denotes the genomic position, while the y-axis encodes quantitative expression values. The bars are uniformly colored in pink. The chart has a static arrangement with a center radius, providing a focused visualization of data distributed across all chromosomes.
