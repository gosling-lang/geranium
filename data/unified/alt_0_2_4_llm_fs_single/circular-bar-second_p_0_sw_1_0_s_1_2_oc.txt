The visualization features a circular bar chart arranged vertically, representing genomic data from chromosome 1 in the range of 1 to 3,000,500. It displays four layers corresponding to 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4,' with the data encoded using bars. Each sample is differentiated by color. The x-axis represents the genome, while the y-axis shows expression levels. The chart includes a legend to identify each sample by color. Data is presented as multivec with categories, and it utilizes a circular layout with specified tracks and genomic positions, as indicated by the processed specification and the image provided.
