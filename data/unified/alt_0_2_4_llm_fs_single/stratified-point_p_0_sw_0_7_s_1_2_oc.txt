A multi-row scatter plot in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The data is displayed across four rows named 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each point's position along the x-axis represents genomic 'position', and the size and y-position reflect 'peak' values, colored by 'sample'. The plot also includes a legend highlighting the samples. Points have a semi-transparent appearance with an opacity setting of 0.5. The interactive plot is equipped with tooltips that show start, end positions, peak values, and sample names.
