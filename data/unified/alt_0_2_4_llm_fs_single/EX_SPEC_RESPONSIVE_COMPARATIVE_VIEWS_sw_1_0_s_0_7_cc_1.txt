Here is a description based on the provided specifications and attributes:

The visualization displays three horizontal bar charts aligned side by side, each representing genomic data from different chromosomes. The charts focus on genomic intervals; two are centered on chromosome 12 (from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000) and one on chromosome 9 (from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000) using the hg38 assembly. The height of each bar corresponds to quantitative 'peak' values, with a bin size of 8. The left and right charts are colored in green (#85B348), and the middle chart in sky blue (#6daff4), with each bar having a white stroke for definition. The charts automatically adjust width for responsiveness to varying screen sizes, while maintaining a defined height. The overall layout and zooming attributes are consistent across the charts to ensure a coherent and interactive experience.
