A complex genomic visualization is depicted through a combination of circular and linear layouts. The circular view provides a panoramic representation of the hg19 genome, featuring five concentric tracks. The innermost track is an ideogram displaying chromosomal bands using a range of colors to indicate different staining patterns. An interactive blue brush overlays this track, bridging it to the detailed linear view below.

The second concentric track labeled as 'Putative Driver' annotates key genomic regions with black text. Adjacent tracks depict genomic data using rectangles; "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," highlighted in sky blue and dark orange, respectively. The outermost track illustrates structural variations via connected arcs, colored based on categories such as ‘Translocation’, ‘Duplication’, and ‘Deletion’.

Below, the linear sections begin with an expanded ideogram of chromosome 1, featuring right and left triangles, further emphasizing chromosome arm boundaries. The track labeled 'Putative Driver' annotates significant genomic positions as black texts.

A scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' showcases dense mutation data through color-coded points, each tone representing a mutation subtype. Adjacent tracks visualize 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' events using colored bars, followed by a quantitative visualization for 'Copy Number Variants' using grey bars.

Pertinent data points, including genomic ranges for 'Gain' and 'LOH', are reiterated in linear form, employing blue and orange bars, respectively. The line-connection track effectively visualizes
