The visualization consists of two vertically arranged tracks displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a heat map, with color intensity encoding expression values, stratified by rows representing four samples. The bottom track is a bar chart, with genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, also stratified by sample categories. Each sample is colored differently, enhancing the visual distinction of expression patterns across the samples. A tooltip provides specific genomic positions and expression values for both tracks.
