The visualization represents genomic data in both circular and linear layouts, displaying the entire genome and focusing on chromosome 1. The circular layout includes five tracks: an ideogram, a text annotation track titled 'Putative Driver,' two range annotation tracks ('Gain' in blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange), and a connection track showing structural variations. The linear layout depicts similar data for chromosome 1, with additional tracks: a gene annotation track, a scatter plot marked 'Point Mutation,' and further range annotation tracks. The scatter plot visualizes a VCF file with points colored by mutation subtype. The range tracks display different genomic variations, with categories represented in distinct colors such as blue for 'Gain' and orange for 'LOH'. The visualization links the circular and linear views through an interactive brushed area, enhancing data exploration.
