The visualization consists of two circular scatter plots arranged side by side. Both plots display data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The left plot shows expression values on the y-axis, with point sizes also representing expression magnitude. The categories are distinguished by point colors corresponding to different samples: 'sample 1' (yellow), 'sample 2' (green), 'sample 3' (blue), and 'sample 4' (purple). The right plot also represents expression data, stratified by rows to highlight the different samples, and uses the same color scheme. Both plots share a genomic x-axis and utilize a nominal color encoding for categories, with an opacity of 0.5 applied to the points.
