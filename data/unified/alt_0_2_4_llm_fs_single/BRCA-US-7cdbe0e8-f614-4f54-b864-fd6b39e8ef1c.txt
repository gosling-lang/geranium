The visualization is composed of a circular and a linear view arranged vertically, linked by a blue interactive brush in the circular view. The circular view presents the entire genome, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. Within the circular view, there are five tracks: an ideogram, a text-based annotation, two range annotations, and a line-connection track. The text track displays putative driver genes with annotations from a CSV file, using black text. The range annotation titled 'Gain' shows genomic regions with blue rectangles, whereas 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' uses orange rectangles. Line connections represent different structural variations, encoded by color and stroke, with categories like 'Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion'.

In the linear view, additional tracks appear, including a gene annotation track, a scatterplot for point mutations, and two additional range annotations. The scatterplot, titled 'Point Mutation', visualizes a VCF file with points colored by mutation subtype ('C>A', 'C>G', etc.) and positioned according to their distance from previous mutations. The first range annotation depicts insertions and deletions from a VCF file with distinct colors, while the second, titled 'Copy Number Variants', uses gray rectangles to indicate values from a CSV file. The genome regions are clear, detailed, and provide a comprehensive view of genomic variations, enhancing data understanding significantly.
