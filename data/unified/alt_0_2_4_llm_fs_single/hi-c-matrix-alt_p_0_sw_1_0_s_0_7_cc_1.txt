A Hi-C matrix visualization in a linear layout uses genomic data from multiple chromosomes between 800,000,000 and 1,800,000,000 base pairs. The main heatmap encodes interaction frequencies with a color scale ranging from light to dark orange, representing increasing interaction intensity. Overlaid tracks include vertical and horizontal annotation lines in purple, indicating specific genomic positions on the axes. Additional bar and point charts detail specific genomic regions: bars highlight interaction regions on chromosomes 6 to 8 with varying height and color based on intensity, while light blue points within selected regions show a scatter of interaction values across a range of possible genomic coordinates. The matrix is styled with dashed outlines and a light gray background. The title is "Hi-C Matrix," and the subtitle is "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations."
