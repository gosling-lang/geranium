The visualization is a linear bar chart overlaid with rule marks, representing genomic data. The bar chart shows data from a multivec file, with genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis. Bars are colored sky blue. Dotted rule marks overlay the chart, indicating specific genomic positions with varying stroke widths, colored pink and sky blue, denoting quantitative values. The chart's title is "Rule Mark" and it includes the subtitle "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines."
