A circular area chart displays multivec data across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 in a vertical layout. It features four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', distinguished by color. Area values represent 'peak' data, plotted against genomic positions on the x-axis, and are stratified by rows for each sample category. The chart includes a tooltip for displaying genomic start and end positions, and peak values, with white strokes outlining the areas.
