A vertically arranged linear visualization depicting chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The upper track features a scatter plot of point marks, where each point represents expression values colored by samples in blue, orange, green, and red. The point size corresponds to the 'peak' value and opacity is set to 50%. The lower track displays an area chart stratified by sample, using the same color scheme. Both tracks provide genomic positioning on the x-axis, while the y-axis displays quantitative data. The tooltip offers detailed genomic and quantitative information, emphasizing areas such as start and end positions, peak value, and sample category.
