The visualization is a scatter plot titled "Basic Marks: point," with a subtitle "Tutorial Examples." It features a linear layout displaying genomic data from a multivec file of the hg38 assembly. The chart spans a width of 560 and a height of 156 pixels. Points are plotted along the genome on the x-axis, showcasing different chromosome ranges. The y-axis represents quantitative expression values using a field named "peak." The size of each point is also mapped to the "peak" field, adding a dimensional aspect to the visualization. The color of the points is a vibrant orange.
