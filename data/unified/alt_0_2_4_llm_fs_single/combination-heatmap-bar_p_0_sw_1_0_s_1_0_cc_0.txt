The visualization consists of two vertically arranged linear tracks: a heat map and a bar chart. Both tracks display genomic data across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track, a heat map, encodes expression values using color intensity from light yellow to dark brown, stratified by samples 1 to 4. The bottom track, a bar chart, represents expression values on the y-axis with colored bars corresponding to each sample: blue, orange, green, and red. Both tracks provide detailed tooltips including start and end genomic positions, expression values, and sample names.
