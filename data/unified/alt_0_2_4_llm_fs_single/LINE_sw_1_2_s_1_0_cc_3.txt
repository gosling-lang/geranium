A line chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, illustrating the entire genome of hg38. The line represents the expression values from sample 1, plotted against genomic positions on the x-axis. The y-axis quantifies the expression levels. The line's color is green, with a thickness of 2 units. The visualization is titled 'Basic Marks: line' with a subtitle 'Tutorial Examples.'
