A linear heatmap displays genomic data for chromosome 1 within the range of 1 to 3,000,500. The visualization is divided into four horizontal tracks, each representing a different sample ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'). The data is plotted using rectangular marks where the color intensity encodes the expression values from a 'multivec' dataset file. The x-axis shows genomic intervals, and a color legend indicates the expression value scale. A tooltip allows interaction, providing additional information about the genomic start, end, value, and sample for each point on the chart. The layout is vertical with a center radius of 0.8, and the visualization adapts dynamically to changes in zoom.
