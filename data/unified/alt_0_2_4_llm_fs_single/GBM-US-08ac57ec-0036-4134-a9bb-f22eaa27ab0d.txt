A circular and linear genomic visualization is presented. The circular view displays the entire hg19 genome with tracks for an ideogram, gene annotations, and data on structural variants like gains or loss of heterozygosity (LOH). The tracks are color-coded, with blue for gains and orange for LOH. An interactive brush links the circular and linear views, focusing on chromosome 1.

The linear view provides a detailed breakdown of chromosome 1, including an ideogram, tracks for putative driver genes, and annotations for point mutations, indels, and copy number variations. Point mutations are plotted as scatter points, colored by subtype. Range annotations display genomic regions with associated variations, colored in shades indicating insertion and deletion events. The visualization effectively combines multiple data types, enabling comprehensive genomic analysis.
