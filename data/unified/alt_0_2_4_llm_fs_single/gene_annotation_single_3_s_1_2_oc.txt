The visualization presents a linear genomic range annotation track titled 'HiGlass,' focusing on chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The chart is structured horizontally with vertical views, showing genes on separate rows based on strand direction. Genes on the positive strand are represented with right-aligned blue triangles, while those on the negative strand use left-aligned red triangles. Exons are displayed as rectangles. Text annotations identify gene names. The color coding by strand—blue for positive and red for negative—is distinct. Overall, the layout effectively illustrates genomic features and their orientations within the specified interval.
