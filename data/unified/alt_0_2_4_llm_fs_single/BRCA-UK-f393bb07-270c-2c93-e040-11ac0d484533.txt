The visualization consists of a circular and linear view structured vertically. The circular view displays the entire hg19 genome, featuring multiple tracks: an ideogram, text annotations for putative drivers, gain and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) tracks using colored rectangles, and a connection track illustrating structural variations like translocations, duplications, deletions, inversions (TtT and HtH). The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, detailing chromosomal bands, text annotations, point mutations, insertions, deletions, and copy number variants (CNVs). It uses color-coded data for mutations and variations, enhancing differentiation between genomic features. The chart is interactive with a blue brush for range selection and displays detailed genomic relationships through visual and spatial encoding.
