The visualization consists of overlaid matrix tracks in a linear layout representing genomic data on chromosome 10. Two matrix tracks are aligned in an overlay, displaying genomic intervals on both x and y-axes. The color intensity within the matrices encodes quantitative expression values. The first matrix track uses a gradient ranging from hot colors, while the second uses greyscale. The layout dynamically adjusts for width changes, ensuring responsiveness. This design features interactive elements linking the tracks to the same data field, enhancing comparative genomic analysis.
