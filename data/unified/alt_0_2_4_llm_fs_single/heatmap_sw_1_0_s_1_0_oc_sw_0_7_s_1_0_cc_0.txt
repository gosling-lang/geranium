The image shows a heat map chart titled "HFFc6_Micro-C". This chart visualizes a genomic matrix on both x and y axes with intervals representing genomic coordinates. The data is colored using a gradient, where the intensity of the orange hue encodes quantitative values from the matrix data. This visualization employs a linear layout in a horizontal orientation, with a specific width of 420 pixels and height of 600 pixels. The data source is a matrix file accessed from a URL, focusing on the human genome assembly hg38. The entire setting is designed to allow interactive exploration by adjusting zoom levels, though no axes or grid lines are displayed to maintain clarity in visualizing dense genomic data regions.
