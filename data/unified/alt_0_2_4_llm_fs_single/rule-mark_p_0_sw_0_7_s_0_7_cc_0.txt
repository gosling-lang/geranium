A visualization titled "Rule Mark" with a subtitle "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines" presents a linear layout. It features three overlaid tracks. The first track is a bar chart displaying genomic intervals on the x-axis and quantitative values on the y-axis, with purple bars representing categories from a multivec dataset. The second track overlays horizontal and vertical dashed green lines, indicating specific quantitative values. The third track includes vertical sky blue lines, enhancing the annotation layer. The visualization captures a dynamic range of genomic data, highlighted by these annotated lines, and has dimensions of 500x230 units.
