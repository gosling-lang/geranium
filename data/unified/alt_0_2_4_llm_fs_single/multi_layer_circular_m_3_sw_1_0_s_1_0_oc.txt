A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying data from chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. This chart is stratified by rows corresponding to different categories, denoted as 'sample 1' to 'sample 16'. Each row is represented by bars whose colors reflect the sample category. The y-axis illustrates expression values with varying domains for each track. Multiple tracks are overlayed with adjustments in opacity to highlight different expression ranges. The visualization includes references to graphical perception of multiple time series as discussed in a study by Javed et al., TVCG 2010.
