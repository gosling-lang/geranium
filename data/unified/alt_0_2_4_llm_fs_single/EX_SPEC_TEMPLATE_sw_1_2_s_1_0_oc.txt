The visualization consists of a linear layout with three primary tracks. The first track is a genomic range annotation track for chromosome 3, showcasing genes with annotations such as exon positions, strand directionality, and gene names like "DNAH1" and "PBRM1." The track displays elements like arrows and rectangles in gray, differentiated by strand. The second track displays a sequence multivec plot for chromosome 1, highlighting base counts across a specific region (77,925,299 to 77,925,320) with color-coded bars representing bases A, T, G, and C. The third track features an ideogram of chromosome 1, with cytogenetic banding patterns including stain colors for different regions. The ideogram helps contextualize the position along the chromosome with labels like "p31.1", "q12", and "q43". The visualization's descriptive title is "Track Template In Gosling.js," promoting the ability to create complex visualizations utilizing track templates effectively.
