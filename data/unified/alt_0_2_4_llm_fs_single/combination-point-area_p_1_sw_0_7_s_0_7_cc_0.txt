The visualization consists of two vertically arranged tracks in a linear layout, each spanning chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track features an area chart where the genomic positions on the x-axis are represented as peaks on the y-axis. This track is stratified by samples, each displayed in distinct colors: blue (sample 1), orange (sample 2), green (sample 3), and red (sample 4). The bottom track is a scatter plot showing the same genomic range. Here, expression values are depicted as points with varying sizes corresponding to their expression levels. Points are also colored according to sample categories, consistent with the area chart. Both tracks are interactive, allowing for detailed examination of specific genomic intervals through tooltips. The data is visualized using a multivec file, and the overall layout emphasizes ease of comparison between the different samples across the specified genomic range.
