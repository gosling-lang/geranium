A linear area chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying the entire genome of hg38. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis shows quantitative data fields named 'peak'. The area is colored in green, with a thickness defined by a value of 2, showcasing expression levels across different genome segments. The chart is titled 'Basic Marks: area', with a subtitle 'Tutorial Examples'.
