The visualization is a circular layout featuring parallel arrangements of genomic data across chromosomes 1 to 5. Each circular track consists of two main visual encodings: area plots representing multivec data of genomic positions and ideograms showing cytogenetic bands. The area plots display quantitative peak values across samples, with colors indicating different samples. Each ideogram includes text labels for chromosomal bands and color-coded rectangles representing density, with g-var regions highlighted in purple. Acen regions are marked with maroon triangles. The layout uses radiating circles for each chromosome, with varying radii to accommodate data layers, while maintaining a consistent viewing angle around a central point.
