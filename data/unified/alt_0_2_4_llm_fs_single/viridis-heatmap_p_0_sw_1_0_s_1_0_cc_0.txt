The visualization is a linear heat map showing genomic data for chromosome 1, in a range from 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. It features a color-coded representation of expression values along the x-axis, which are categorized and stratified into four rows labeled 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'. The expression values are represented as color intensities, using a 'hot' color scheme that varies from light to dark, indicating varying levels of expression peaks. Data is sourced from a multivec file with a bin size of 4, providing quantitative insights enhanced by a tooltip that details the genomic start and end positions, sample type, and expression value. The visualization is effectively structured in a vertical arrangement with a centered radius, facilitating a comprehensive overview of genomic expression across samples.
