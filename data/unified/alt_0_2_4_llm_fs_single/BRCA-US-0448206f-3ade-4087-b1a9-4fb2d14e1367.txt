The visualization consists of two parts: a circular view and a linear view arranged vertically and linked through a blue interactive brush on the circular ideogram. The circular view represents the entire genome, with a focus on chromosome 1, featuring the following tracks: an ideogram showing chromosomal bands, a point annotation track, two range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' with data from a CSV file, and a line-connection track illustrating structural variants using a CSV file. In the linear view, data is presented across several tracks, including an ideogram, a text annotation track titled 'Putative Driver', a point mutation scatter plot, and multiple range tracks visualizing various genomic events like insertions, deletions, and copy number variants (CNVs). Different colors and shapes encode categorical data, such as structural variant classes and mutation subtypes, with some tracks offering interactive elements for detailed exploration through tooltips. This comprehensive and detailed visualization facilitates the analysis of complex genomic data through a combination of layouts and encodings, enhancing insight into chromosomal structure and variation.
