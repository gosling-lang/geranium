A linear visualization in a vertical arrangement presents a multivec file across two stacked tracks, covering chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track displays a bar chart where bars represent genomic regions with heights corresponding to quantitative values 'peak_min' and 'peak_max'. Colors differentiate four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The bottom track showcases an area chart, with colored areas depicting 'peak' values across samples, highlighting changes in expression levels. Both charts are stratified by rows per category and include tooltip interactions for detailed exploration of genomic positions and values.
