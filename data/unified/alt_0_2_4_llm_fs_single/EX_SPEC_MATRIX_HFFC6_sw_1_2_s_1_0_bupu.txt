This visualization, titled "Matrix Visualization," compares Micro-C and Hi-C for HFFc6 cells, focusing on chromosome 7 from 77,700,000 to 81,000,000. Arranged horizontally, it features multiple tracks including bar charts and matrix plots.

The left vertical bar charts display genomic intervals with expression values represented by color-coded bars: HFFc6_H3K4me3 in dark green, HFFc6_ATAC in orange, and HFFc6_CTCF in navy blue. Gene annotations are visualized with pink and green triangles indicating genomic positions.

Two main matrix plots compare spatial genomic interactions. The first matrix depicts HFFc6_Micro-C, and the second shows HFFc6_Hi-C interactions, with intensity indicating interaction strength. Both are set against a light gray background to enhance visibility. The visualization includes an "Epilogos (hg38)" track at the bottom, displaying categorical marks in various colors to represent chromatin states.

This comprehensive visualization uses genomic data to highlight structural and interaction patterns within the specified chromosome region.
