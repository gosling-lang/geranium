A linear scatter plot visualizes point mutations from a VCF file across multiple chromosomes, with an emphasis on tumor-normal comparisons. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis displays the logarithmic distance to prior mutations. Data points are colored based on mutation subtypes, including 'C>A', 'C>G', 'C>T', 'T>A', 'T>C', and 'T>G', providing a clear differentiation of mutation categories. The visualization is titled 'Point mutations from a VCF file' with a legend indicating the color-coded mutation types.
