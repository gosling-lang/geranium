A circular and linear genomic visualization linked by a brush. The circular view represents the entire genome with five tracks: an ideogram, a text annotation track for 'Putative Driver', and tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' displaying genomic ranges in blue and orange rectangles, respectively. Connections are shown in various colors representing categories like 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' etc. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, featuring an ideogram, a text annotation track, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' showing mutation distances, and other annotation tracks for 'Insertion,' 'Deletion,' and 'Copy Number Variants.' Rectangles in these tracks are color-coded, enhancing visual differentiation.
