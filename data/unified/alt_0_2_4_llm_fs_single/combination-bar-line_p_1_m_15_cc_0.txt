A linear, vertical layout visualization of genomic data displays chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The visualization consists of two tracks. The top track overlays line and bar charts, with the x-axis representing genomic positions. Expression values are depicted as lines and bars, segmented by four samples: 'sample 1' through 'sample 4.' Each sample is uniquely coloredâ€”blue, orange, green, and red respectively. The bottom track is a standalone line chart, maintaining the same categories and color coding. This configuration facilitates comparative analysis across different samples and visualizes peak data points effectively.
