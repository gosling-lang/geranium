A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file across chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The chart features multiple concentric rows representing different samples, each encoded with a distinct color. The height of the bars reflects the quantitative 'peak' values, segmented into five opacity layers. The chart does not include a legend for sample categories. The circular layout emphasizes variations and trends within the specified genomic interval, with data organized to facilitate comparison of expression levels across different sample categories.
