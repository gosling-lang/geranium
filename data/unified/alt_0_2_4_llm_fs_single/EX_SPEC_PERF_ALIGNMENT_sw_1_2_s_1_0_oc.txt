The visualization titled "Smoother Zoom" presents an alignment of genomic sequences displayed in two stacked linear views for comparison. Both views utilize a CSV dataset containing genomic fields with a specified interval from 350 to 396. The top track, labeled "New Approach: Stretching Tiles," showcases colored rectangles representing base pairs, where different colors denote various categories. Black text overlays the rectangles, detailing base information. This track applies an experimental feature allowing for smoother zooming by scaling graphics instead of redrawing. The bottom track, titled "Original Approach," mirrors the top view's data but without the stretching feature, providing a baseline for comparison. Both tracks align rectangles and text to genomic positions and categorize them by nominal row fields without legends. This setup highlights the efficiency of graphical stretching over traditional redrawing in genomic data visualization.
