The visualization comprises a circular and a linear view, linked interactively by a blue brush in the circular view. The circular section shows the entire genome with five tracks: an ideogram, a point annotation track, two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and a line-connection track. The "Gain" and "LOH" tracks display genomic ranges in blue and red rectangles, respectively. The connection track links genomic positions using lines colored based on the 'svclass' field, indicating categories like 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.'

The linear view covers chromosome 1, featuring nine tracks paralleling the circular view with additional annotations. It includes a gene annotation track, a scatter plot for "Point Mutations" visualizing VCF data as distance points, colored according to the 'SUBTYPE' field, and two range annotation tracks for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' visualized in yellow and green rectangles. The "Copy Number Variants" track displays quantitative data ('total_cn') in light grey bars. The arrangement provides a comprehensive genomic overview, integrating structural variations and mutations.
