A circular line chart represents multiple quantitative series across chromosome 12, ranging from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. Each line corresponds to a different sample, encoding intensity (peak) on the y-axis without an explicit axis. Samples are grouped by rows, and their identities are signified through distinct line colors. The visualization comprises overlays with varying opacity to highlight different peak intensity domains. Designed to track changes across specified intervals, this chart follows conventions outlined by Javed et al. in their study on graphical perception of time series in TVCG 2010.
