The visualization displays a circular and linear arrangement highlighting genomic data from hg19. The circular view features an ideogram, text annotations labeled "Putative Driver," and two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)." Connections depict various structural variations colored by categories: 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' 'Inversion (TtT),' and 'Inversion (HtH).'

The linear view includes similar tracks with additional layers: gene annotations revealed through text and graphics, a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" showing VCF data, and CNV tracks in grey. The interactive blue brush in the circular ideogram links to the chromosome 1 region in the linear view, providing an insightful genomic exploration tool.
