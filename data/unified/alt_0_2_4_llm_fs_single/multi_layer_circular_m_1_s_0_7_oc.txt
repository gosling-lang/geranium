A circular line chart visualizes a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart comprises multiple lines representing different samples, stratified by rows. Each line corresponds to a sample and plots genomic start and end positions against quantitative peak values. The lines are colored based on sample categories, revealing distinct peaks within specified genomic intervals. The chart uses a circular layout with genomic positions mapped along the radial axis, emphasizing variations in expression across samples.
