The visualization consists of a circular view and a linear view, linked by a blue interactive brush in the circular view. The circular view represents the entire genome and features an ideogram, annotations, and color-coded connections indicating various genomic features like 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH).' The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, showcasing tracks such as a gene annotation track, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation,' and additional range annotation tracks. These tracks visualize genomic data using colored rectangles and points, representing categories like 'Insertion' and 'Deletion.' The interactive brush allows seamless navigation between the circular and linear views.
