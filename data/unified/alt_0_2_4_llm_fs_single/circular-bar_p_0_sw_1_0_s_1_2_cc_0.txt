A circular bar chart in a vertical arrangement visualizes a multivec file for chromosome 1, covering the interval from 1 to 3,000,500. The data is stratified into two categories, 'sample 1' and 'sample 2,' represented by blue and orange bars, respectively. The bars display genomic regions on the x-axis, with minimum and maximum peak values on the y-axis. The visualization includes interactive tooltips showing genomic position and peak values. The chart features black outlines on the bars, enhancing visibility and detailed data presentation.
