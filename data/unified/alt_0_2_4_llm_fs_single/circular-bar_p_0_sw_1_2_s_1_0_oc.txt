The visualization is a circular bar chart, showing genomic data for chromosome 1 within the range of 1 to 3,000,500. The chart displays two samples, 'sample 1' and 'sample 2', represented by different colors with a legend provided for distinction. Each bar's position corresponds to genomic intervals on the circular x-axis, while the height indicates expression values between 'peak_min' and 'peak_max'. The chart is segmented into rows based on the sample categories. The bars are stroked in black, emphasizing the genomic data distribution. Tooltip information includes genomic position, minimum and maximum values, and sample identification. The layout's static nature indicates no interactive zoom, maintaining a consistent visual overview of the data across this genomic region.
