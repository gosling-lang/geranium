The visualization titled "Hi-C Matrix" uses a linear overlay layout to depict genomic data, focusing on the interval between 800,000,000 and 1,800,000,000 base pairs. The primary visualization is a heatmap-style matrix plotted on both x- and y-axes, representing genomic interactions with color intensity. This matrix is enhanced with overlaid tracks including vertical and horizontal green lines, marking specific genomic positions along the axes. Additional elements include regions represented as orange bars and points in purple, varying in size according to quantitative values, which further annotate the genomic regions. The dashed style and light gray background add visual emphasis to the matrix, while the interactive features of the matrix provide detailed exploration capabilities. The matrix effectively visualizes co-location interactions and annotations of different genomic segments, such as chromosomes 6, 7, and 8.
