The visualization is a line and scatter plot in a linear layout, focusing on chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500. It uses multivec data to plot expression values ('peak') across four samples, 'sample 1' to 'sample 4.' Each sample is distinguished by color: blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The x-axis is genomic, showing the position, and the y-axis displays quantitative peak values. Points and lines are used to represent data, with point sizes encoding expression levels. The layout is stratified by sample rows, enhancing clarity and comparison across samples.
