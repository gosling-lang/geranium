A circular layout visualization featuring two horizontally arranged views displays multivec data from chromosome 1, covering positions 1 to 3,000,500. Both views represent scatter plots where genomic positions are on the x-axis, and expression values are shown using point size and position on the y-axis. Points are colored based on categorical data fields named 'sample,' distinguishing four categories: 'sample 1' to 'sample 4.' The left view is a unified circular scatter plot, while the right view stratifies data by rows, separating categories visually. Point opacity is set to 0.5 for both views, and a data legend provides sample color mapping. Tooltips offer detailed genomic and quantitative information for each point.
