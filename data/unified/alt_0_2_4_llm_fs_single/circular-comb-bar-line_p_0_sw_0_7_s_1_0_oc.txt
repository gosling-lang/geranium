A circular layout visualization features two adjacent charts displaying genomic data. The left chart is a circular bar chart representing genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis with bars. The colors indicate four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The right chart is a circular line chart and scatter plot, displaying genomic positions on the x-axis with lines and points reflecting expression values on the y-axis. The size of the points signifies the expression magnitude, and the chart is stratified by categories using color. Both charts cover chromosome 1 within the interval 1 to 3,000,500 of the hg38 assembly, with a center radius of 0.5 and static layout.
