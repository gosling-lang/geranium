The visualization titled "Gremlin (O'Brien et al. 2010)" displays a linear arrangement of three interactive views that explore genomic data on chromosome 5. The top track presents chromosomal features with ideogram bands represented as pink and gray rectangles. Labels for specific chromosomal bands are dynamically displayed based on visibility within genomic intervals. Below the ideogram, connections between genomic positions are shown using links colored in sky blue and green. These links represent segmental duplications and rearrangements within chromosome 5 and between adjacent chromosomes 4 and 6. The second view, titled "Region of Interest," zooms into a specific genomic interval, [68,000,000, 71,000,000], displaying detailed connections relevant to that region across chromosomes. The final view, labeled "Rearrangement View," further zooms into a smaller interval [69,276,000, 69,282,000], detailing rearrangements using thicker blue links. The visualization employs transparent colors and linking interactions, enabling smooth exploration of structural variances in the genomic data.
