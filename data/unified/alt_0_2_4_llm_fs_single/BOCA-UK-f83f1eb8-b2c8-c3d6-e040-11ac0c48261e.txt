The visualization consists of two main views arranged vertically: a circular view above a linear view. Both views are synchronized using an interactive blue brush in the circular section. The circular view provides a genomic overview, displaying all chromosomes, while the linear view focuses specifically on chromosome 1.

In the circular view, several tracks present different data types:
- An ideogram displays chromosome bands, with a color-coded key indicating various categories.
- A text track labeled "Putative Driver" highlights gene annotations.
- Two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" show genomic intervals using sky-blue and dark-orange rectangles, respectively.
- A connection track depicts links between genomic positions, with colors representing different structural variations like 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.'

The linear view expands on chromosome 1, featuring:
- A transcript annotation track highlighting gene structures with triangles and rectangles.
- A scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" shows data from a VCF file, with points positioned based on the distance to previous mutations and colored by mutation subtype.
- Range annotations for "Insertion" and "Deletion" exhibit rectangles in distinct colors for each type.
- Copy Number Variants (CNVs) are displayed in a track, with positions encoded as quantitative values.

This visualization effectively integrates different genomic datasets, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of genomic changes across chromosome 1, complemented by an overview of all chromosomes in the circular view.
