The visualization is a circular layout featuring two distinct tracks. The left track is a bar chart segmented by rows representing categories labeled 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' Each category is uniquely colored, and genomic data is plotted on the x-axis while expression levels are depicted using bars on the y-axis. The right track is a heat map, where genomic intervals along the x-axis are encoded by color intensity to reflect expression values. It also stratifies rows by category. The visualization covers the chromosome 1 region from position 1 to 3,000,500.
