The visualization consists of nine linear, vertically arranged charts depicting genomic data from chromosome 1, covering a range from 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. These charts utilize a multivec file with data stratified by four samples. The visual encodings include:

1. **Heat map**: Displays genome intervals on the x-axis with color intensity representing expression values across samples.
2. **Bar charts**: Three bar charts show genomic positions on the x-axis and expression on the y-axis, differentiated by row and color according to the sample category.
3. **Line and scatter plot overlay**: Combines line charts and scatter plots, marking genomic positions and expression values, with point size indicating peak magnitude.
4. **Scatter plots**: Two separate plots depict genomic positions against expression values, using point size and color for different samples.
5. **Area chart**: Visualizes genomic data with filled areas under the curve, color-coded by sample.
6. **Range bar chart**: Represents min and max expression values using bars, organized by sample and colored accordingly.
7. **Connection chart**: Illustrates genomic intervals with arcs, using color to denote different categorical connections.

Each track is equipped with tooltips for genomic position and expression details, enhancing data exploration. The layout employs consistent genomic axis labels for intuitive navigation.
