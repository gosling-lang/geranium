A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file focusing on chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart features multiple rows corresponding to different samples, each represented by a distinct color. Adaptable height and opacity settings adjust the visibility of different segments based on track height, allowing for a better view of variations in peak values among samples. The chart emphasizes genomic intervals on the x-axis, with expression levels depicted by the height of the bars on the y-axis. The design accommodates both circular and alternative linear layouts depending on the aspect ratio of the display, offering responsive visualization.
