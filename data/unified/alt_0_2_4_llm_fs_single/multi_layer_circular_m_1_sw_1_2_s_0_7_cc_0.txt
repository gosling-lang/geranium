A circular line chart visualizes a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart displays multiple lines for various samples, stratified by rows and represented in different colors. The y-axis shows expression values with five distinct overlays, each capturing a specific range of peak values. The chart is designed without x-axis labels, using colors from blue to cyan for different samples. The visualization is part of a project referenced by Javed et al., highlighting graphical perception of multiple time series.
