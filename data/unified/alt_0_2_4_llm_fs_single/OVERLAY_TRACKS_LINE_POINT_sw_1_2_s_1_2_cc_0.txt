A linear visualization titled "Example: Overlayed Tracks" displays genomic data of chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. It uses data from a multivec file with categories named 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The chart is composed of four overlaid tracks featuring both line marks and point marks. The lines represent genomic positions and are stratified by rows for each sample category. Points indicate quantitative 'peak' values, with size ranging based on their magnitude. The colors of the lines and points correspond to different samples, using a palette including blue, orange, green, and red.
