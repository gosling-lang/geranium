A comprehensive visualization with two linked horizontal sections compares Micro-C and Hi-C data for HFFc6 cells. It includes genomic bar charts and matrix tracks on chromosome 7 between positions 77,700,000 and 81,000,000. The top section features vertical orientation tracks, each showing data for HFFc6_H3K4me3, ATAC, and CTCF with purple, dark green, and orange bars, respectively. Genomic position annotation is added with colored triangles for strand information. The matrix track shows Micro-C data with high-intensity color encoding. The lower section replicates the structure for Hi-C data, featuring a similar matrix layout and bar charts. Both sections incorporate Epilogos multivec data with colors indicating different genomic features. This layout facilitates comparison across different structural genomic interactions while highlighting chromatin accessibility and binding patterns.
