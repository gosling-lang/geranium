A circular and linear genomic visualization shows the structure of the human genome in a multi-track format. The circular view displays the entire genome with tracks like an ideogram, a text annotation track (titled "Putative Driver"), and range annotations for genomic gains (in sky blue) and Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) (in dark orange). These are interspersed with categorical line connections indicating structural variations, such as "Gain," "LOH," "Translocation," "Duplication," "Deletion," and "Inversion." 

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, segmented by an interactive brush in the circular view above. It comprises tracks including an ideogram, text annotations (again titled "Putative Driver"), and chromosomal features such as "Copy Number Variants," highlighting genomic regions with light grey bars. A scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" shows mutation types along the genomic position. Additional tracks depict insertions and deletions with colored annotations, providing a detailed view of variants affecting genomic architecture.
