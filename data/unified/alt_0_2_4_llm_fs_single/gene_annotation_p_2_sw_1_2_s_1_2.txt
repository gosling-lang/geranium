The visualization is a linear genomic annotation track encompassing chromosome 3, between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. It features two horizontal arrangements, each containing three vertical views. The left section includes charts titled 'Cyverse-QUBES', 'GmGDV', and an untitled genomic range annotation track, showcasing gene, exon, and intron coverage using various shapes like rectangles, right and left triangles, and lines. Color coding differentiates the strand orientation: positive strands use blue and negative strands use red. The right section includes charts titled 'HiGlass', 'IGV', and 'Corces et al.', displaying similar data with strands in blue for positive and red for negative. The annotation tracks highlight detailed gene structures with vibrant color coding and text labeling for quick identification.
