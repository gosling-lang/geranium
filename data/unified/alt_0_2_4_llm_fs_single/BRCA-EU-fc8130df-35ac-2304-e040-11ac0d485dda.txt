A composite visualization displays genomic data using circular and linear layouts for the hg19 human genome assembly. The circular layout includes six tracks, showcasing an ideogram, a driver mutation annotation, gain and loss of heterozygosity regions, and structural variant connections. The ideogram highlights chromosome bands with brushed sections linked to the linear layout. 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' regions are marked using sky blue and dark orange rectangles, respectively. Structural variations are represented by lines and colored based on seven categories: Gain, LOH, Translocation, Duplication, Deletion, Inversion (TtT), and Inversion (HtH).

The linear layout provides a detailed focus on chromosome 1, featuring tracks for chromosomal bands, putative drivers, gene structures, and mutation points. A scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' maps inter-mutation distances, with points colored by subtype. Copy Number Variants are visualized as rectangles, where height corresponds to copy number levels. Additional tracks display insertions, deletions, and the same structural variant information seen in the circular view. All genomic elements are interactively linked and annotated for detailed exploration.
