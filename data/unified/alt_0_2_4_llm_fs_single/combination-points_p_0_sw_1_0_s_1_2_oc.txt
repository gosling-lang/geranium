The visualization consists of two vertically arranged scatter plots, showing genomic data for chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. Each track represents expression values as points, where their position on the x-axis indicates the genomic position, and the y-axis represents the quantitative expression level. The first track displays data stratified by categories 'sample 1' through 'sample 4', with each category colored distinctly and points sized according to expression values. The second track continues this pattern but includes a background grid to aid in evaluating quantitative differences. Categories are consistently represented across both plots, enhancing comparison. Opacity for the points is set to 0.5, allowing for visualization of density and overlapping data points. Tooltips provide additional genomic and expression value details upon interaction.
