A genomic visualization with a linear layout displays data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top track features an area chart, with peaks representing expression values across four samples, shown on the y-axis. Each sample, identified as 'sample 1' through 'sample 4', is represented by distinct colors with a legend. The chart is stratified by rows for each sample. The bottom track presents a bar chart displaying genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Bars represent the minimum and maximum peak values, color-coded similarly to the top chart for consistency across samples. Both tracks utilize a multivec file for data input.
