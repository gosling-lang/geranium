The visualization comprises a circular layout with two main charts representing genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. On the left, a circular heat map displays data using the 'multivec' file type, encoding expression values through gradient color intensity within the hot color scheme. This chart is divided into rows based on four samples, highlighting variations in peak intensity.

On the right, a circular bar chart utilizes bar heights to represent quantitative expression values along the y-axis. This chart also stratifies data by samples, with each sample colored distinctly (blue, orange, green, red). Tooltip interactions provide detailed genomic position and peak value information upon cursor hover. Both charts are linked through a shared genomic x-axis, facilitating a comprehensive view of genomic variations across samples.
