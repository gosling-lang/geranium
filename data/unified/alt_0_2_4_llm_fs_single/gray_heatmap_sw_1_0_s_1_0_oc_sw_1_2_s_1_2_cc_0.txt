### Description

This visualization is a heat map in a linear layout representing a matrix of genomic data from the hg38 assembly. Both the x-axis and y-axis display genomic intervals, specifically chromosomes, which are marked on the top and left side of the heat map, respectively. The chart is static with no interactive components. Each cell in the matrix is colored according to a quantitative value field labeled 'value,' with the color intensity encoding the expression values through a 'hot' color range. The width and height of the chart are 606 and 510 units, respectively, providing a clear, detailed view of genomic relationships. The visualization utilizes rectangular marks to depict the data, with genomic fields 'xs' to 'xe' on the x-axis and 'ys' to 'ye' on the y-axis.
