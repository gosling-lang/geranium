The visualization presents a vertical arrangement with two main components: a circular overview and two horizontal bar charts. The circular component displays a genomic overview with stacked bar charts and connections between genomic positions across multiple chromosomes. Each stack represents different samples, with colors indicating categories for 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'. The circular view also features a connection track indicating structural variations such as deletions, inversions, and translocations, categorized by stroke color.

Linked to the circular overview are two detailed horizontal bar charts, focused on chromosome 5 and chromosome 16. These detailed views zoom into specific genomic regions, highlighting the expression values across the same sample categories. The background colors of these charts correspond to their interactive linkages with the circular view, with blue for chromosome 5 and red for chromosome 16.

Overall, this integrated visualization facilitates multi-level genomic exploration by linking a global circular view with specific detailed horizontal views, enabling an analysis of genomic features and variations across different samples and chromosomes.
