The visualization titled "Hi-C Matrix" uses a linear layout to display genomic interactions. It features an overlay of tracks, visualizing a Hi-C matrix and additional annotations. The main matrix displays genomic intervals on both the x- and y-axes, with intensity of color representing interaction values. Annotations include vertical and horizontal lines in sky blue and pink, respectively, marking notable genomic positions. Another matrix layer differentiates categories with bar strokes. A scatterplot of pink points, overlaid on the matrix, encodes data about expression values, with height and size representing quantitative variations. The color scale used is 'hot,' signifying intensity or value density in the visualization.
