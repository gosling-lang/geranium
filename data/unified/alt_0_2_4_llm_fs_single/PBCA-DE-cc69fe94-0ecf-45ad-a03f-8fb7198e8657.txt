The visualization consists of two linked views: a circular layout above a linear layout. The circular view shows the entire genome using a circular ideogram and displays various genomic features overlaid in concentric tracks. The ideogram uses color to represent different categories of cytobands, with a blue interactive brush for selection. Tracks include annotations for genomic features like 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in blue and orange rectangles, respectively. Connections between genomic positions are color-coded based on structural variations, including 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.'

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, detailing specific genomic annotations. It includes an ideogram showing chromosomal bands, a 'Putative Driver' track with labeled text annotations, and a 'Point Mutation' scatterplot. The scatterplot points represent distances to previous mutations and are colored by subtype. Additional tracks display 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' events in a VCF file, 'Copy Number Variants' in grey rectangles, and annotated genomic ranges like 'Gain' and 'LOH.' A legend explains the color-coding of the structural variants.
