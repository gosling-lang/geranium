A linear visualization titled "Example: Overlay Tracks" illustrating genomic data from chromosome 3 using a BEDDB format. The visualization overlays bar and point tracks to depict significance levels of genomic features. Bars and points are colored based on categories such as "Pathogenic," "Likely Pathogenic," and "Benign," with annotations indicating varying levels of clinical significance. Categories are distinguished using a color scheme, including shades of orange for pathogenic variants and green for benign ones. The x-axis represents genomic intervals along chromosome 3, and the y-axis categorizes significance, baseline set at "Uncertain Significance." The chart uses a stroke and color legend to enhance interpretability, facilitating a comprehensive assessment of genomic data significance.
