The visualization consists of a linear layout with two vertically arranged tracks, each representing genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is an area chart displaying genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. It is stratified by rows for four samples, with areas colored differently for each sample: sample 1, sample 2, sample 3, and sample 4. The bottom track is a bar chart featuring genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression range (min to max) on the y-axis. It also shows the data stratified by the same four samples, with bars colored accordingly. The visual encoding includes color and segmentation by sample for both area and bar displays. The visualization uses multivec data, with additional styling features such as white strokes for area boundaries and black strokes for the bars, enhancing visibility and differentiation among categories.
