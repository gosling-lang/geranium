A circular bar chart visualizes a vector dataset representing genomic data from the entire genome of hg38. The position on the genome is mapped to the angular dimension, and the height of each bar represents the quantitative 'peak' value. The bars are colored in purple. This visualization employs a static, circular layout with a center radius, creating a compact and visually appealing display.
