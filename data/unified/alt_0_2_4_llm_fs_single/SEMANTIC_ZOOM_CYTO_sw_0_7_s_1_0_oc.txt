The visualization titled "Example: Semantic Zooming" showcases an ideogram with a linear layout displaying chromosome bands from the human genome assembly hg38. It offers a semantic zooming feature, where text and triangle marks appear upon zooming in for detailed observations. The x-axis represents genomic intervals, with chromosomes differentiated by color. The rectangles indicate various chromosomal stains, such as gneg, gpos25, and others. Right and left triangles, colored maroon, denote specific regions like centromeres. This layout allows for an interactive exploration of genomic data, revealing more details on closer inspection.
