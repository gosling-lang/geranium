The circular visualization contains two tracks. The left track is a multivec-based circular bar chart displaying data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. It includes four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each represented by its unique color (blue, orange, green, red). The vertical arrangement allows for easy comparison across categories. The right track is a circular heat map also focusing on the same genomic region. This track encodes expression values using color intensity, presenting quantitative variations across the intervals. Both tracks are interactive and provide detailed genomic information through tooltip annotations.
