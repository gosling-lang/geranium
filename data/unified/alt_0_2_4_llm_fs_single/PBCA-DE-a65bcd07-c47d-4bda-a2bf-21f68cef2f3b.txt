The visualization features a circular ideogram above a linear genomic view, both linked by an interactive brush. The circular ideogram displays the entire hg19 genome, highlighting chromosomal features with color-coded rectangles. It features annotation tracks for 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' with genomic ranges shown in blue and orange, respectively. Connecting lines of varying colors depict structural variations such as translocations and duplications.

Beneath, the linear view zooms into chromosome 1, providing a detailed display. It includes various tracks: an ideogram, a text annotation track titled 'Putative Driver,' which stratifies data by categories (displayed in black text), and a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation,' in which colored points represent different mutation subtypes. Additional tracks illustrate 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' events with yellow and green rectangles, respectively. Another track, 'Copy Number Variants,' uses gray bars to indicate variation severity. This detailed, multi-layered genomic visualization aids in exploring complex genomic data across different chromosomes and specific regions.
