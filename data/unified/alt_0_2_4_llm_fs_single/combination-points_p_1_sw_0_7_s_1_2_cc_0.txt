The visualization consists of two vertically arranged scatter plots showcasing genomic data on a linear scale across chromosome 1. The top scatter plot presents the expression values using points, with their size and position on the y-axis representing the 'peak' data field. Colors indicate different samples ('sample 1' to 'sample 4') and provide a categorical distinction. The x-axis spans genomic positions from 1 to 3,000,500.

The bottom scatter plot is similarly structured but stratified by rows corresponding to each sample category, enhancing clarity of categorical differences. The points' color and size convey quantitative 'peak' values, providing insight into variation across the genomic positions. Both plots include a tooltip feature detailing genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample information, facilitating interactive exploration of the dataset. The layout effectively visualizes multivec data, offering an accessible view of complex genomic relationships.
