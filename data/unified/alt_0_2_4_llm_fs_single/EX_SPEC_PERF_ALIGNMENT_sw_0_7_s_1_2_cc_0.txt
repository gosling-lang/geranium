The visualization titled "Smoother Zoom" consists of two vertically arranged tracks compared for different rendering approaches. Both tracks use genomic data, displayed as rows of colored rectangles representing different categories. The "New Approach: Stretching Tiles" showcases an innovative technique to scale elements without redrawing them, enhancing zoom smoothness within the x-domain interval of 350 to 396. In contrast, the "Original Approach" redraws elements every frame. Text is overlaid on the rectangles, with its color set to black, while the genome is represented horizontally on the x-axis. This depiction demonstrates the effectiveness of stretching graphics in maintaining visual continuity during zooming.
