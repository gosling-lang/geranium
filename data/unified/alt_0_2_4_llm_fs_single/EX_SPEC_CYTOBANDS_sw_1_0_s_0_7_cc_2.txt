This visualization consists of five parallel linear tracks, each depicting a different chromosome (chr1 to chr5) from the hg38 assembly. The plotted data includes area charts representing genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peaks on the y-axis, colored variably to indicate four distinct categories (samples 1 to 4). Each track also includes an ideogram featuring band annotations in rectangles, with colors ranging from white to black, reflecting chromosomal density. Text annotations (band labels) are integrated, appearing black, while right and left triangles in maroon mark centromere regions. This setup facilitates a comparative view across five chromosomes, linking genomic regions with associated quantitative data.
