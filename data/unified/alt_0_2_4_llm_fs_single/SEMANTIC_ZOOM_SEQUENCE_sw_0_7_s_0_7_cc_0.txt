The visualization titled "Example: Semantic Zooming" consists of a linear track displaying multivec data. The track includes overlaid bar and text marks, allowing text annotations of base pairs to appear as users zoom in. Bars represent the count of each category (A, T, G, C) on the y-axis, colored distinctively in blue, orange, green, and red. Text annotations emerge in white as users zoom, positioned along a genomic x-axis indicating positions ranging from chr1 to chrY. Enhanced with a bold text style, this interactive visualization effectively highlights base pair data and their corresponding counts.
