A heat map in a linear layout visualizes a matrix file of the hg38 assembly. Both x- and y-axes represent genomic coordinates with no visible axis, while color intensity encodes expression values. The data, sourced from "HFFc6_Micro-C," uses a warm color scale to depict quantitative measures. The visualization does not incorporate interactive elements like zooming or tooltips, focusing solely on presenting the genomic data distribution within a 504x420 pixel framework.
