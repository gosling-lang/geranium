The visualization consists of two linked views: a circular overview and a detailed linear view, both displaying genomic data related to chromosome 1 using the hg19 assembly. The circular view includes five layers: an ideogram, a text-based information layer titled "Putative Driver," blue rectangles indicating "Gain," orange rectangles indicating "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and connections between genomic positions, color-coded by structural variant class. The linear view zooms into a specific region of chromosome 1, featuring an ideogram, a gene annotation layer, a scatterplot titled "Point Mutation," which uses various colors to differentiate mutation subtypes, and additional tracks showing "Insertion" and "Deletion" events. The data layers are styled with text weights and colors to enhance visualization clarity and are interactively linked, allowing cross-referencing through a blue brush in the circular view.
