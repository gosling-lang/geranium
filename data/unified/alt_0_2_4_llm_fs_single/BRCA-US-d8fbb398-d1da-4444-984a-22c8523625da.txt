The visualization consists of a dual layout featuring both circular and linear representations of genomic data. The circular view encompasses five tracks including an ideogram, a text annotation track titled "Putative Driver," and two range annotation tracks named "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," which display in blue and orange rectangles, respectively. The line-connection track indicates structural variations with various colors representing categories such as 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' 'Inversion (TtT),' and 'Inversion (HtH).' The blue brush in the ideogram enables zooming and focus linking the two views.

The linear view represents chromosome 1, aligned with the circular ideogram, and includes similar tracks as in the circular view. Additional features include a gene annotation track and a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation," where each point's position indicates its distance to the previous mutation, with colors depicting mutation subtypes. Two in-depth range annotation tracks illustrate insertions and deletions in the associated VCF file, while another track shows "Copy Number Variants," characterized by gray bars representing 'total_cn' values. Triangles and lines within the data help guide visual connections across genomic positions, further highlighting structural variations.
