A vertical linear layout visualizes BED files across chromosome 1, ranging from 1 to 2,000,000. There are four tracks, each representing different BED file specifications. The first track, titled 'BED12: All 12 standard fields,' uses green rectangles, while 'BED6: A file with the first 6 BED fields' uses pink rectangles. 'BED6+6: A file with the first 6 BED fields, and 6 custom fields' and 'BED12+1: A file with all 12 standard fields, and a single extra custom field' both utilize green rectangles, showcasing variation in genome intervals. The layout, focused on hg38 assembly, enables easy visualization of genomic data distributions with consistent styling of rectangles marked by black outlines.
