This visualization displays genomic data in both circular and linear layouts, linked by a blue interactive brush. The circular view, resembling an ideogram, showcases the entire hg19 genome. It includes tracks such as a point annotation track and range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' showing genomic ranges in blue and red rectangles, respectively. A line-connection track illustrates structural variations like translocation and duplication, differentiated by color based on the 'svclass' data field.

Below the circular layout, the linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and features an ideogram track indicating chromosomal bands. It includes tracks for 'Putative Driver' annotations, point mutations, insertions and deletions, and copy number variants (CNVs). The point mutation track uses a scatter plot to represent distances to previous mutations with color-coded subtypes. Additional tracks further annotate mutations with rectangles, distinguishing between insertions and deletions. Overall, this visualization enables multidimensional genomic data exploration, facilitating an understanding of both structural variations and sequence mutations.
