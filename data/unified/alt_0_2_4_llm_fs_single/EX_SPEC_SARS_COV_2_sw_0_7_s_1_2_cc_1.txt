A linear genomic visualization presents the SARS-CoV-2 genome using data from WashU Virus Genome Browser, NCBI, and GISAID. The genome's complete length of 29,903 bases is shown with various annotation tracks. The first track, titled "NC_045512.2 Genes," displays genomic intervals with green rectangles and pink vertical lines representing gene locations. It includes a brush interaction for linking to a detailed view. A detailed view overlays several tracks: "S Protein Annotation," illustrating structural features of the spike protein with color-coded rectangles for categories like RBD and HR1; "NC_045512.2 Sequence," showing nucleotide counts with bars in colors representing bases A, T, G, and C; and "TRS-L-Dependent Recombination Events," which visualizes potential recombination sites as blue links, indicating possible genomic interactions.
