The visualization is a linear genomic range annotation track for chromosome 3, spanning positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. It displays vertical arrangements of genes, exons, and introns using rectangles. Genes are represented in dark gray, exons in red, and introns in light blue. The elements are stratified by strand with two categories, with annotations shown in separate rows. The track uses rectangles with a size value of 30 and is outlined with a stroke of width 1 in medium gray.
