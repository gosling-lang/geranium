A circular and linear dual-view visualization illustrates genomic data from hg19. The circular view includes an ideogram with interactive brushing, a "Putative Driver" text track, and additional range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)." These tracks display categorical data using various colors, such as sky blue for "Gain" and orange for "LOH." The line-connection track depicts structural variants, using different colors for categories like "Translocation" and "Duplication." The linear view shows chromosome 1, featuring tracks for gene annotations, point mutations, and copy number variants. The "Point Mutation" scatter plot visualizes a VCF file, with color-coded points for different mutation subtypes. Rectangular tracks for "Insertion" and "Deletion" display genomic intervals, while another track shows "Copy Number Variants." Each view is linked through interactive mechanisms, allowing detailed genomic exploration.
