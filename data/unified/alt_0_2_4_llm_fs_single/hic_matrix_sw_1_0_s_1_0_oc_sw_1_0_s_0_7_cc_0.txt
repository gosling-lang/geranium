A heat map in a linear layout visualizes a genomic matrix from a specified interval, ranging from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 in assembly hg38. The genomic positions are represented along both the x-axis and y-axis, with their intervals highlighted. The intensity of the color encodes quantitative expression values using a 'hot' color range. This visualization effectively represents the complex interactions across this genomic region.
