The visualization titled "Pileup Track Using BAM Data" presents coverage and pileup tracks in a linear layout, visualizing sequence alignment over a genomic region on chromosome 1, spanning from 136,750 to 139,450 base pairs. The top track, a bar chart, depicts the coverage of reads in the given genomic interval using silver bars, with the height representing the quantitative number of reads aligned to each position. The bottom track displays individual reads as rectangles, stratified by rows according to their respective pileup levels. Various colors are employed to denote distinct structural variation types such as 'normal read', 'deletion (+-)', 'inversion (++), 'inversion (--)', 'duplication (-+)', 'more than two mates', 'mates not found within chromosome', and 'clipping', each linked to their location on the genome. The layout is non-static, supporting interaction features like zooming, ensuring dynamic exploration.
