A Hi-C matrix visualization, titled "Hi-C Matrix," overlays multiple tracks to represent genomic data and annotations. The matrix displays genomic intervals on both x- and y-axes, with color intensity indicating expression values. Two rule tracks annotate genomic positions, one with red vertical lines and the other with blue horizontal lines. Additional bars denote different categories via colored strokes. Points plotted on the same genomic axes showcase data with steelblue color, varying in size based on quantitative values. The subtitle is "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations."
