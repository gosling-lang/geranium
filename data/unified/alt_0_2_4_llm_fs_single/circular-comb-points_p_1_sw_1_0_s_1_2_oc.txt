The visualization consists of two circular scatter plots arranged horizontally. The genome of chromosome 1, spanning from 1 to 3,000,500, is displayed along the x-axis in both plots. The left plot shows expression values through points on the y-axis and size-axis, with their colors representing four nominal categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The right plot also uses a circular scatter layout but stratifies the data into rows for each category. Each category is visually distinguished by the color of the points, aiding in differentiating between the samples. The plots provide interactive tooltips that offer details on genomic start and end positions, expression values formatted to two decimal places, and the associated sample category. The overall layout and static arrangement emphasize the coherence of the genomic data representation in a compact and visually distinct format.
