The visualization is a linear genomic range annotation track that represents gene structures on chromosome 3, from positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. The data are sourced from a BED database focused on gene annotations, specifically indicating genes, exons, and introns. The chart employs an overlay of rectangle marks to differentiate the genomic features: genes are depicted in pink, while exons and introns are shown in blue. The track is stratified by strand direction, with rows indicating the '+' and '-' strands. The layout is horizontal, with an axis on top, and features a consistent visual style including gray strokes for boundaries. The data interpolation uses a nominal field for strand identification, and the visualization is adjustable with zoom capabilities.
