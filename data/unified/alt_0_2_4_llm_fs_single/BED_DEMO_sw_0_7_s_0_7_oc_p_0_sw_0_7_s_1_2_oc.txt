A linear layout displays four tracks, each visualizing BED files with different specifications over chromosome 1, ranging from base pair 1 to 2,000,000. The titles of the tracks indicate the types of BED files: 'BED12: All 12 standard fields,' 'BED6: A file with the first 6 BED fields,' 'BED6+6: A file with the first 6 BED fields, and 6 custom fields,' and 'BED12+1: A file with all 12 standard fields, and a single extra custom field.' Each track uses black-outlined rectangles to represent genomic intervals with a fixed height. The layout allows for a comparative view of how different BED specifications represent the data. The title is 'BED files' and the subtitle is 'Demonstration of using BED files of different specifications.'
