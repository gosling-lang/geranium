The visualization is a series of linear tracks displayed vertically, comprising diverse genomic data representations over chromosome 1, spanning from 1 to 3,000,500 units. Each track uses a multivec file, showcasing data across four samples titled "sample 1" to "sample 4."

1. **Heat Map:** Colors represent expression levels across genomic positions, stratified by sample. Each row corresponds to a different sample, with intensity indicating peak values.

2. **Bar Chart (Stacked):** Displays peaks of each sample along the x-axis (genomic position), with y-axis values represented as bars. Color differentiates samples.

3. **Aggregated Bar Chart:** Shows summed expression between samples across genomic positions, using stacked bars where sample-specific colors enhance distinction.

4. **Overlay Track (Line and Point):** Combines line and scatter plots to represent expression trends and specific values. Line tracks peaks while point size and color depict magnitude and sample.

5. **Scatter Plot (Sample-based):** Positions and colors points along the x- and y-axes by sample and peak value. Shows value dispersion across samples with transparency enhancing visibility.

6. **Scatter Plot (Overall):** Similar to the previous, but features grid lines aiding readability of positions and values.

7. **Area Chart:** Depicts expression as a filled area, with contours separating samples. Sample colors indicate categories within the track.

8. **Min-Max Bar Chart:** Represents peak minimum and maximum values across
