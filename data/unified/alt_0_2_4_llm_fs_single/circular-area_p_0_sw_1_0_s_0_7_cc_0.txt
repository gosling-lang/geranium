A circular chart with a vertical arrangement visualizes a multivec file, covering chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500 of hg38. The chart displays genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis using area marks. It is organized into four rows based on samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is assigned a different color for distinction, such as blue, orange, green, and red. The interactive tooltip provides genomic start and end positions along with peak values for each sample.
