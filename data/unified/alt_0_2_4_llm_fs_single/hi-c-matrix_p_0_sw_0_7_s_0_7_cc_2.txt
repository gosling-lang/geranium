A Hi-C matrix visualization, titled "Hi-C Matrix" and subtitled "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations," displays genomic interactions from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 base pairs on a linear layout. The matrix uses a color intensity scale, ranging from yellow to brown, to represent interaction frequencies with a legend indicating quantitative values. There is an overlay of several annotations: vertical green lines and horizontal purple lines mark genomic positions on chromosomes 2, 5, and 10. A bar track overlays genomic regions on chromosomes 6, 7, and 8, using varying stroke colors to denote categories. A point track overlays the matrix, showing quantitative values by the size of points colored in light purple with white strokes. The overall style uses dashed lines, providing clear demarcation of features, and annotations are detailed with specific reference to the genomic positions.
