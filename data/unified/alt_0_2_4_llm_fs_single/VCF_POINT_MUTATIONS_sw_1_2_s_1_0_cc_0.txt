This visualization is a scatter plot in a linear layout depicting point mutations from a VCF file across the genome (hg38 assembly). The x-axis represents genomic positions, with specific chromosomes labeled. The y-axis shows the logarithm of the distance to the previous mutation (DISTPREVLOGE). Each point's color indicates the type of substitution, with a legend on the right denoting six substitution categories: C>A, C>G, C>T, T>A, T>C, and T>G. The plot's subtitle is "Point mutations from a VCF file." The plot is interactive, allowing for exploration of genomic data.
