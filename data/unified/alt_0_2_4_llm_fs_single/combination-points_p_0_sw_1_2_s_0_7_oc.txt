A linear layout visualization shows data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500, from a multivec file. It consists of two scatter plot tracks arranged vertically. Each track displays data using points, where the x-axis represents genomic positions, and the y-axis represents peak values. The size and color of the points vary based on the 'peak' value and 'sample' category, respectively. The top track is stratified by rows for four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', indicated by different colors. Opacity is set at 0.5 to aid in visual clarity. The data is rendered in two views with tooltips showing the start and end positions, peak values, and sample names.
