A linear ideogram visualization displays chromosome 7. The ideogram uses a CSV data file with fields indicating chromosomal bands and corresponding genomic positions. The bands are encoded with rectangular and triangular shapes in various shades of gray, black, and maroon, representing different categories based on the field "Stain." Labels for chromosomal regions are added through overlayed text annotations, appearing only when the display height allows. This responsive visualization automatically adjusts width and height. The text is predominantly black or gray, depending on visibility conditions.
