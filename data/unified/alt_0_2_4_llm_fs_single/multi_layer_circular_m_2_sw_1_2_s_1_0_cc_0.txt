A circular chart visualizes a multivec file with stratified area segments, showing chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart displays data across 16 samples in a circular layout. Each area segment is color-coded to represent different samples, excluding sample “-”. The genomic data ranges are marked on the x-axis, while the y-axis represents peak values. The chart utilizes varying opacities to distinguish data ranges from 0 to 0.01, with detailed segmentation into smaller domains for enhanced visibility. The overall design references graphical perception of multiple time series.
