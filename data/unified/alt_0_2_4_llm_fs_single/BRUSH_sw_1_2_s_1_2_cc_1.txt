A linear visualization presents two line charts demonstrating genomic data for chromosome 1. The top chart, colored in green, spans the entire chromosome and offers an overview. It features an interactive brush, highlighted in steel blue, which links to a detailed view below. The bottom chart, focused on a specific range from 200,000,000 to 220,000,000, is highlighted in light blue for enhanced clarity. The title "Example: Brushing and Linking" is displayed above. This chart employs multivec data to depict 'peak' expression values on the y-axis, providing insightful genomic analysis.
