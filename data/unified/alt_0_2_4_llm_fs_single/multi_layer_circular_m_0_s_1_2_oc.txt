A circular scatter plot displays genomic intervals of chromosome 12, ranging from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The plot contains eight rows, labeled from 'sample 1' to 'sample 8', excluding 'sample -'. Each row is represented using points whose colors correspond to different samples. The genomic positions are encoded along the x-axis, while expression levels are shown on the y-axis, with a quantitative domain from 0 to 0.01. The data, obtained from a multivec file, is filtered to exclude certain samples, providing a clean view in a radial layout. The chart, sized 960 pixels in diameter, visualizes data sourced from a multivec dataset.
