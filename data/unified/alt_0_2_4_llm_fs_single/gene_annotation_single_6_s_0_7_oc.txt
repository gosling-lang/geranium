The visualization is a linear genomic range annotation track titled 'Cyverse-QUBES,' focusing on chromosome 3 from positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. It shows gene annotations using text and various shapes. The track features gene names in black text, gray triangles indicating gene strands, and light gray rectangles representing gene bodies. Exons are highlighted with purple rectangles, outlined in violet. The track is stratified by strand, distinguishing between '+' and '-' strands, with a visual overlay for gene alignment.
