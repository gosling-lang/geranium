A genomic visualization shows a linear pileup track using BAM data for chromosome 1 between positions 136,750 and 139,450. The layout includes two primary tracks. The top track is a coverage bar chart, where the height represents the number of aligned reads and is colored silver. The bottom track is a pileup chart displaying individual reads as colored rectangles indicating various structural variations. Categories such as 'normal read', 'deletion', 'inversion', 'duplication', and others are delineated using distinct colors like gray, orange, green, blue, and red. The overall chart is titled "Pileup Track Using BAM Data", with read alignment intricacies enhanced by color coding and detailed genomic positions.
