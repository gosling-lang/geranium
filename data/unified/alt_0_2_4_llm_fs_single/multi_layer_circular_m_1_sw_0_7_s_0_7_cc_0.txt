A circular line chart visualizes a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart features multiple lines, each representing a different sample category, with lines colored in various shades like blue, orange, and green. The x-axis displays genomic intervals, while the y-axis shows expression values as quantified peaks. The chart stratifies data into multiple layers based on value domains, with variable opacity highlighting different expression intensities. This visualization references “Graphical perception of Multiple Time Series” by Javed et al., highlighting the perception of multiple time series data.
