The visualization, titled "Matrix Visualization" with the subtitle "Comparison of Micro-C and Hi-C for HFFc6 Cells," presents a horizontal arrangement of genomic data along chromosome 7, highlighting the interval between 77,700,000 and 81,000,000. The composition features a combination of bar charts, matrix heatmaps, and genomic annotation tracks arranged vertically and horizontally.

The left section illustrates vertical bar charts for H3K4me3 and ATAC-seq data in purple and dark green, respectively. Additionally, overlay tracks feature CTCF data displayed with an orange bar and right and left genomic position annotations represented as pink and green triangles for different strand directions. 

The central section focuses on a large grid visualizing Hi-C data for HFFc6 cells, with color intensity representing the interaction strength between genomic regions in a matrix layout. This grid is directly compared with the Micro-C data beside it, enabling insight into the distinct or overlapping contact maps indicated by the vibrant color spectrum ranging from warm hues to purple.

The bottom section contains an Epilogos annotation track for hg38, presenting the category-based expression data in a horizontal bar chart form. This section highlights various categories like Active Transcription Start Sites (TSS), Enhancers, and Repressed PolyComb states, differentiated by a spectrum of colors from red and orange to shades of gray.
