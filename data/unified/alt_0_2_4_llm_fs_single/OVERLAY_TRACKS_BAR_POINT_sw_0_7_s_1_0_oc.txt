A linear overlay chart visualizes genomic data from a BEDDB file for chromosome 3. The chart, titled "Example: Overlay Tracks," features bars and points that represent the clinical significance of various genomic intervals. The x-axis shows genomic intervals, while the y-axis categorizes significance levels, such as 'Pathogenic,' 'Likely pathogenic,' and 'Benign.' Bars have nominal stroke colors, and points share the same color scale, including shades like orange, black, and green. This visualization effectively uses color and stroke to distinguish between categories, with an opacity of 0.6 to provide clarity and depth to the overlay.
