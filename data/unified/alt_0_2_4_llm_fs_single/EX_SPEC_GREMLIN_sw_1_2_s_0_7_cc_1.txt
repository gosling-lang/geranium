A genomic visualization titled "Gremlin (O'Brien et al. 2010)" in a linear layout displays data related to chromosome 5. The top section features an ideogram with colored bands representing different stains across chromosome 5, with sky blue text labels. This is followed by a segment duplication (segdup) chart, displaying connections within and between chromosomes 4, 5, and 6. The connections are color-coded, with sky blue representing chromosome 5. Below, a "Region of Interest" track portrays connections in a specified genomic interval with translucent lines. At the bottom, a "Rearrangement View" highlights a focused region within chromosome 5, depicted with thicker blue connections, indicating genomic rearrangements. The visualization employs multiple linked views with interactive brushes to facilitate cross-navigation.
