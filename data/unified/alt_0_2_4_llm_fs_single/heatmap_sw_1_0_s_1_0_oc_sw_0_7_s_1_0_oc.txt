The visualization presents a heatmap in a linear layout, displaying a matrix of genomic interactions using data from the "HFFc6_Micro-C" dataset. The axes represent genomic intervals, both horizontally and vertically, creating a two-dimensional representation. The color intensity of each rectangular cell encodes quantitative values, utilizing a warm color scheme to differentiate levels of expression. The layout spans 420 units in width and 600 units in height, with no visible axes, emphasizing a focus on data visualization. The chart's title is "HFFc6_Micro-C."
