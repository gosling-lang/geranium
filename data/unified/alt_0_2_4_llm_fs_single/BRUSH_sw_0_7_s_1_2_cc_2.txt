A linear layout visualization comprises two linked line charts representing genomic data. The top chart, colored in pink, displays genome positions along chromosome 1. It features a 'brush' interaction, highlighted in 'steelBlue,' which links to the bottom chart. This bottom chart, titled 'Example: Brushing and Linking,' is in sky blue and zooms into the genomic interval between 200,000,000 and 220,000,000 on chromosome 1, emphasizing the peak values.
