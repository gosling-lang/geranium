This visualization is a circular chart titled "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements." It depicts genomic data using a circular layout with various tracks arranged in parallel. The outermost track is a bar chart showing the genome across the circular axis, with expression values represented by light gray bars. Two ideogram tracks display chromosomal regions, using different shades to denote categories such as gneg, gpos, and acen. Between these ideograms is a track with connecting lines representing genomic links from different chromosomes, segmented by color: links from chromosome 1 are in black, while all others are in light gray. The layout is circular, with a central radius, allowing for a compact and comprehensive visualization of genomic relationships.
