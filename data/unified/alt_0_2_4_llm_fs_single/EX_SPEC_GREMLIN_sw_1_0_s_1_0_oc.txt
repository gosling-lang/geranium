The visualization titled "Gremlin (O'Brien et al. 2010)" presents a linear layout of chromosome 5, spanning an interval from 0 to 80,000,000 base pairs, using a multiview arrangement. The first track is an ideogram showing bands of chromosome 5, colored to indicate different stain types, with pink for acen regions and varying shades of gray and black for other regions such as gneg and gpos bands. Labels for certain bands appear as text along the ideogram, and an interactive brush is linked to another view. Following the ideogram, two tracks visualize segmental duplications, distinguished by color and stroke, showing homologous regions across hs5, hs4, and hs6 chromosomes. The "Region of Interest" view zooms into a specific interval on chromosome 5 (68,000,000 to 71,000,000), displaying detailed connections with emphasis on rearrangements. Colored strokes (blue, green) represent different chromosome connections. Finally, the "Rearrangement View" focuses further on a small rearranged region, maintaining the blue connections. This visualization uses linked views to facilitate exploration of genomic features and structural variations across chromosome 5.
