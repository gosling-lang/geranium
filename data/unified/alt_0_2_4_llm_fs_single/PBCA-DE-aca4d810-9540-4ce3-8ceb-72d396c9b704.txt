A visualization comprising a circular and a linear layout is employed to analyze genomic data from the hg19 assembly. The circular view functions as an overview, encapsulating the entire genome. It includes a detailed ideogram and annotation tracks that highlight genomic gains and losses, highlighted in blue and orange, respectively. Linking between views is facilitated by a brush tool, allowing users to synchronize their inspection with the linear view. The linear section focuses on chromosome 1, diving deeper into genomic features. It showcases tracks such as 'Putative Driver' for gene annotations, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' using VCF data, and a 'Copy Number Variants' range track showing quantitative data distributions. Additional tracks include rows for insertions and deletions, denoted by varied colored rectangles, and structural variations displayed as connections, color-coded to represent different svclass categories like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.'
