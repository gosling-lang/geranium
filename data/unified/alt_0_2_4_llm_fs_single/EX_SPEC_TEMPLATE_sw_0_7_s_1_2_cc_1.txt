The visualization consists of three main linear tracks:

1. **Gene Annotation Track**: A range annotation on chromosome 3, spanning positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000, showcases genes with names and exons. Forward and reverse strands are depicted using triangles and rectangles in gray, marked with labels in white to increase visibility.

2. **Sequence Track**: Displayed on chromosome 1 between 77,925,299 and 77,925,320, it uses a bar chart to show sequence counts for bases A, T, G, and C. Bars and corresponding labels are colored to match each base.

3. **Ideogram Track**: An ideogram of chromosome 1 highlights regions with specific stains, ranging from white to black, with informative text and triangle markers for centromere positions. It provides a reference for genomic positions along the chromosome. 

The layout is in a vertical arrangement, titled "Track Template In Gosling.js," demonstrating Gosling.js's capability to create detailed, complex genomic visualizations effortlessly.
