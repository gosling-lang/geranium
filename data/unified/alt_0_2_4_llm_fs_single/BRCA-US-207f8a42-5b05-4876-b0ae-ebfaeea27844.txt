A circular and linear genomic visualization is presented, arranged vertically with linked interactive elements. The circular view displays the entire genome of hg19 through tracks: a colorful ideogram indicating genome categories, labeled 'Putative Driver,' and tracks showing structural variations like 'Gain' in sky blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in dark orange, with connections illustrated in various colors for structural variants. The linear view zooms into chromosome 1, featuring similar tracks, a comprehensive gene annotation, scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation,' and a copy number variation track. The scatter plot shows mutation distances, colored by subtype. Both layouts are interactive, connected by a brush in the circular view, enhancing exploration of genomic regions.
