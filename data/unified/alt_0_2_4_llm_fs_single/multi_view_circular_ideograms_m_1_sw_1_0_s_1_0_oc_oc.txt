A circular visualization of genomic data showcases a multivec file for chromosome 1. The outer track is a line chart that depicts expression levels across positions, with colors representing four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The inner track is a circular ideogram that highlights different genomic intervals with rectangles colored based on 'Stain' types from a CSV dataset, excluding 'acen'. The layout emphasizes quantitative and categorical genomic data in a compact, radial format.
