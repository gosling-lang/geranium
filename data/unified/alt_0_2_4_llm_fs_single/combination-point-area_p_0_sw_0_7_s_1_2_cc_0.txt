The visualization consists of two tracks arranged vertically, displaying genomic data in a linear layout. The top track is a scatter plot where each point represents a data point from a multivec file, with positions on chromosome 1 ranging from 1 to 3,000,500. The points are colored differently for four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', with a color range that includes blue, orange, green, and red. The y-axis represents quantitative peak values, and the size of each point corresponds to the peak value as well, with an opacity of 0.5.

The bottom track is an area chart stratified by the same four categories, each displayed as a separate row. The y-axis similarly represents peak values, and each area's color corresponds to its category, matching the scatter plot for consistency. A tooltip provides detailed genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample information for user interaction. In both tracks, the genome is represented on the x-axis, explicitly showing continuous genomic intervals. The visualization uses the hg38 assembly and accommodates dynamic zoom levels.
