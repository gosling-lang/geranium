A composite visualization with circular and linear views linked by an interactive brush. The circular view presents a genomic ideogram of the human genome (hg19) with tracks displaying genomic features such as a putative driver annotation, 'Gain', 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)', and structural variations (SVs) like translocations, duplications, and inversions, in distinct colors. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, incorporating tracks for point mutations, copy number variants, and SVs, color-coded to illustrate different mutation types. Visualizations use CSV and VCF data sources, with circles and rectangles marking genomic positions and variations. Key tracks include bar plots for copy number variants and scatter plots for point mutations, emphasizing genomic data's complexity and diversity through aesthetic and functional detailing.
