This visualization comprises two horizontally aligned genomic tracks on chromosome 1, ranging from 1 to 3,000,500. The top track features a line chart with four color-coded categories: sample 1 (blue), sample 2 (orange), sample 3 (green), and sample 4 (red). These categories represent the quantitative field 'peak' encoded along the y-axis, with genomic positions on the x-axis. The bottom track is an overlay of both bar and line charts, differentiated into rows by sample categories. The bars and lines are similarly color-coded, with varying sizes representing different expression values. This setup is designed for interactive exploration with tooltips providing detailed information, such as start and end genomic positions and peak values.
