This visualization consists of two vertically arranged linear tracks showing genomic data for chromosome 1 within the interval [1, 3,000,500]. The top track displays an area chart where expression levels are represented across four samples, each stratified by rows and distinguished by color. The bottom track features a scatter plot with points indicating expression values. The size and color of each point reflect quantitative and categorical data, respectively, from the same samples. Both tracks provide tooltips for genomic positions and expression values, enhancing interactivity and data exploration.
