A circular view and a linear view are arranged vertically, linked by an interactive brush highlighting chromosome 1. The circular view features the entire genome with five tracks: an ideogram, a point annotation track showing genetic drivers, two range annotation tracks—'Gain' in blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange—and a connection track visualizing structural variations like translocations and inversions, with colors indicating categories. The linear view reveals details for chromosome 1, with tracks including gene annotations, point mutations, and copy number variants. The scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' shows alterations colored by subtype. The alignment track depicts insertions and deletions, and a range annotation track illustrates copy number variations in gray.
