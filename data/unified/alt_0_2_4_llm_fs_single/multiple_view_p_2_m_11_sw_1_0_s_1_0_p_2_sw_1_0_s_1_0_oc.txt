The visualization is titled "Visual Linking" and comprises two main views arranged vertically. The upper view contains a circular line chart and a layered area chart, each showing genomic data for chromosome 1. The circular chart displays genomic intervals with expression values represented by colored lines, categorized by samples. An interactive brush allows linking to other charts. The area chart displays expression values by shaded areas, with categories indicated by color. Both charts enable analyzing variations across samples.

The lower view provides a detailed linear scatter plot focusing on a specific interval of chromosome 1 (160,000,000 to 200,000,000). Points represent expression values, categorically displayed in different colors for each sample. This view is dynamically linked to the upper charts, enabling seamless exploration of genomic data. Overall, the visualization effectively combines circular and linear layouts for interactive genomic analysis.
