A multivec file is visualized as a circular bar chart, showing chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The bars represent quantitative 'peak' values and are stratified by 'sample,' which include 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' The colors blue, orange, green, and red differentiate the samples. This visualization uses a circular layout in a vertical arrangement with a static view. Tooltip information includes genomic positions and peak values.
