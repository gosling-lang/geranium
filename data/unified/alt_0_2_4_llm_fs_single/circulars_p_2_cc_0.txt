The visualization showcases diverse visual encoding methods applied in circular layouts to represent multivec data from chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The layout includes multiple horizontal views arranged vertically. Each view contains circular tracks featuring different marks such as bars, rectangles, areas, lines, points, and withinLink connections. The tracks are differentiated by categories 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4,' each illustrated with distinct colors like blue, orange, green, and red. The charts include circular bar charts, heat maps, scatter plots, line charts, area plots, and connection maps, each highlighting genomic positions against expression values. Tooltip information offers detailed genomic and quantitative data for enhanced interaction. The title of the visualization is "Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts," with the subtitle "Gosling provides diverse visual encoding methods in circular layouts."
