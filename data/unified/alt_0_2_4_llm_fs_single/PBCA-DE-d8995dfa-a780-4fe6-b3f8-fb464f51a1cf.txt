A circular and a linear view are vertically arranged, linked by an interactive brush in the circular view. The circular view visualizes the entire hg19 genome and features an ideogram track, a text annotation track for "Putative Driver," two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" (blue) and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" (orange), and a connection track. The connection track displays structural variations in varied colors based on the 'svclass' field, including 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.'

The linear view zooms into chromosome 1, highlighting an ideogram, gene annotations, and several other tracks. A scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" maps VCF data with points indicating the distance to the previous mutation, colored by 'SUBTYPE.' Additional tracks represent insertions and deletions from a VCF file with distinct colors, and a "Copy Number Variants" track using a CSV file shows quantitative 'total_cn' data with gray rectangles. The visualization effectively conveys genomic structural variations and annotations across different chromosomes and positions.
