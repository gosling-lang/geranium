A linear heat map visualization displays genomic data along chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The data is visualized as a multivec file in a vertical layout, split into four rows corresponding to 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' Each row shows variations in 'peak' values, reflected in color intensity from a 'hot' color range. The x-axis represents genomic start and end positions. This detailed representation is enhanced with interactive tooltips providing information on start, end, peak value, and sample category encoded in each rectangle.
