A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file representing genomic data from chromosome 12, ranging from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The visualization consists of multiple concentric layers, each corresponding to a different category drawn from sixteen samples, excluding "sample -." The data is represented as bars, with height indicating the 'peak' field, a quantitative expression value. Categories are color-coded but without legends for some rows. The chart stratifies samples in rows, each varying in opacity to represent different expression range bands: 0–0.0025, 0.0025–0.005, 0.005–0.0075, and 0.0075–0.01. The title references a study on graphical perception of time series.
