The visualization consists of two interconnected linear line charts, designed to explore genomic data. The top chart displays a complete view of chromosome 1, with genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative expression values on the y-axis, depicted in sky blue lines. A brush tool allows users to select a specific range, which corresponds to the region shown in the bottom chart. The bottom chart zooms in on chromosome 1, from 200,000,000 to 220,000,000, with lines colored in light purple. This chart features a semi-transparent blue background to highlight the selected genomic region. The interactive linking between the charts enables detailed exploration of data within specified genomic intervals, as indicated by the title "Example: Brushing and Linking." The integration of these visual encodings offers a dynamic method for examining and comparing genomic expressions across different scales within the human genome assembly hg38.
