The visualization is a circular chart that displays linked genomic data from chromosome 1 of the hg38 assembly, focusing on the interval from positions 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. It employs a within-link mark to illustrate connections between different genomic regions. These links are color-coded based on the starting position, and feature black strokes with a width of 0.5 units and an opacity of 0.2. The chart has a vertical arrangement and includes horizontal-oriented tracks within a circular layout, with a center radius of 0.5. The x-axis depicts genomic intervals, enhancing insights into the structural variations across the genome.
