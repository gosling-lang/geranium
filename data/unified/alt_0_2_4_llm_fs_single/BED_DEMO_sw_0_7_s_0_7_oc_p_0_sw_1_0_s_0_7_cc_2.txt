A linear visualization showcases BED files of varying specifications. It spans chromosome 1 from position 1 to 2,000,000. Four tracks display rectangles representing genomic intervals: the first with all 12 BED fields in green, the second with the first 6 BED fields in purple, the third with 6 BED fields plus 6 custom fields in pink, and the fourth with 12 BED fields plus an extra custom field in pink. Each track is distinctively colored and annotated with respective field descriptions.
