A vertical arrangement of two scatter plots visualizes genomic data from a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The upper chart displays stratified rows for four samples using colored points (blue, orange, green, red) along the y-axis representing expression values. The lower chart similarly uses points varying in size to show expression values, with the same color coding for sample categories. Both charts provide x-axis genomic intervals and an interactive legend indicating samples.
