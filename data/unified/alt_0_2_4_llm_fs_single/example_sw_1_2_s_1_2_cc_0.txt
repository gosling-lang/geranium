The visualization titled "Visual Encoding" demonstrates Gosling's diverse visual encoding methods. It presents a linear layout arranged vertically with a center radius of 0.8, focused on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The visualization consists of multiple tracks:

1. **Heat Map**: Displays genomic intervals on the x-axis with expression values encoded by color intensity, stratified by four samples.
   
2. **Bar Charts**: Three separate bar charts, each showing genomic positions on the x-axis with expression values represented by bar heights. The colors correspond to different samples.

3. **Line Chart and Scatter Plot**: The line chart represents the expression along the x-axis, with points marking specific values. Both line and point colors indicate category differences.
   
4. **Scatter Plots**: Two scatter plots depict genomic positions with points varying in size and color based on expression and category.
   
5. **Area Chart**: Shows areas under curves for expression values, stratified by sample, with colors representing different samples.
   
6. **Connection Chart**: Displays genomic connections with color-coded links indicating different categories.

Data is sourced from multivec files and CSVs, with colors following specified palettes. Each track is interactive, offering tooltips for genomic positions, values, and sample names, enhancing user engagement and data exploration.
