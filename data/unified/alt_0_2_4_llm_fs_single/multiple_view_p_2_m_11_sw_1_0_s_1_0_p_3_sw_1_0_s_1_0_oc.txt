The visualization, titled "Visual Linking," uses a brush to navigate between three views arranged vertically. The top view is a linear scatter plot for chromosome 1 from positions 160,000,000 to 200,000,000, showing genomic data as colored points in multiple rows based on sample categories. The middle view combines a circular line chart and brush interaction, displaying the entire chromosome 1 in concentric lines that represent different samples. The bottom view is a linear area chart showing genomic data with area shading, stratified by samples, and is dynamically linked to the top view through the interactive brush. The color represents different samples, and the visualization emphasizes interconnected data exploration across different genomic intervals.
