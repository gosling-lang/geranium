A visualization titled "Visual Linking" arranged vertically with interactive features. The top view is a linear scatter plot displaying genomic positions on the x-axis ranging from 160,000,000 to 200,000,000 on chromosome 1, with quantitative values on the y-axis represented by points. Categories are differentiated by color: blue, orange, green, and red. Below is a circular line chart showing genomic intervals with categories depicted by colored lines. It includes an interactive brush that links to a third chart. The third view is a linear area chart exhibiting genomic data with area encodings on the y-axis and an interactive brush linking to the top scatter plot, facilitating a dynamic detail view update. The layout enables exploration of multivec genomic data across different scales and dimensions, providing insights into patterns and relationships within the data.
