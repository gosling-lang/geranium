A genomic visualization with two tracks in a linear layout showing multivec data. The top track is a line chart displaying genomic positions on the x-axis for chromosome 2, with quantitative peaks on the y-axis for samples 'sample 1', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The lines are color-coded per sample, outlined in white. The bottom track, an area chart, overlays genomic positions for 'sample 1' and 'sample 2', similarly color-coded and distinguished by filled areas. Both tracks share an interactive linking mechanism, enhancing exploration of genomic data, with an assembly setting of 'hg38'.
