A linear bar chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying the entire genome of hg38. Each bar's height represents the 'peak' values across genomic intervals. The bars are uniformly colored green. The chart is titled "Basic Marks: bar" with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples." The chart spans a width of 960 pixels and a height of 210 pixels, depicting data from a single category, labeled "sample 1." Bars are sized consistently, with a default size setting applied.
