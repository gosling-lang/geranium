The visualization is a linear chart titled "Example: Overlay Tracks" depicting genomic data from chromosome 3. It incorporates both bar and point marks to represent variant significance. The data source is a BEDDB file from "https://cgap-higlass.com." The x-axis shows genomic positions with intervals along chromosome 3. The y-axis categorizes genetic significance into categories like "Pathogenic," "Likely pathogenic," and "Benign," each differentiated by color. Bars have a thin stroke, while points are larger, both encoding categories through color. The chart features an interactive legend showing category associations with specific colors, such as red-orange for "Pathogenic" and green for "Benign."
