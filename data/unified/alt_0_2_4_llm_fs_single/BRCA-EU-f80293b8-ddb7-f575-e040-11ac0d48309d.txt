The visualization consists of a circular and linear view arranged vertically. The circular ideogram displays the entire genome, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. Tracks in the circular view include text annotations, genomic ranges titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)', and connections indicated by color for categories like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication'. The linear view expands on this with a gene annotation track, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' demonstrating VCF data, and additional range annotations for insertions and deletions. The visualization effectively links genomic data with detailed annotations and connections, providing a comprehensive overview of chromosomal variations and mutations.
