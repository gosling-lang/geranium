A line and scatter plot in a linear layout visualizes multivec data, representing chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The chart features four rows corresponding to 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is depicted in a distinct color: blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The line chart denotes the peak expression levels, while scatter plot points indicate quantitative values of these peaks. Point sizes are used to show expression magnitude, with a size range from 0 to 2. A legend is included to identify each sample by color.
