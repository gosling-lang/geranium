A linear visualization displays genomic data of chromosome 1 between 1 and 3,000,500. The top track combines a bar chart and a scatter plot, stratifying data by four samples named 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is represented in distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. Bars and points on the y-axis represent the 'peak' quantitative values, with point sizes varying according to these values. The bottom track presents a scatter plot, showing the same genomic positioning on the x-axis with quantitative expression values on the y-axis. Points are colored based on sample categories.
