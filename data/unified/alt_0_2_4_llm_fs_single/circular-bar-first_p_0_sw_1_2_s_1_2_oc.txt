A circular bar chart in a vertical arrangement visualizes a multivec file, displaying data for chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 using the hg38 assembly. It shows quantitative expression values (peaks) on the y-axis with each bar colored according to a nominal 'sample' category. The chart includes samples 1 to 4, represented in distinct colors. Tooltips provide additional details on start and end genomic positions, peak values, and samples. The view uses a fixed center radius and is static, indicating no interactivity or zooming capabilities.
