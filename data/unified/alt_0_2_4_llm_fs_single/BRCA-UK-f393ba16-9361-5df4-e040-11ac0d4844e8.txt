In a vertical arrangement, a circular view is positioned above a linear view. The circular view includes five tracks, featuring an ideogram, a text annotation track depicting "Putative Driver" genes, and three range annotation tracks showing "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in sky blue and dark orange, respectively, connected with line-connection tracks indicating structural variants such as 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.' An interactive blue brush on the circular view links to the linear view, which displays chromosome 1 within a linear scale. The linear view comprises nine tracks, similar to the circular view, but includes additional tracks: a gene annotation track, a scatterplot for "Point Mutation" from a VCF file, noting mutation distances and subtype categories, and two more range annotation tracksâ€”one showing 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' in different colors, and another for "Copy Number Variants" represented by gray rectangles.
