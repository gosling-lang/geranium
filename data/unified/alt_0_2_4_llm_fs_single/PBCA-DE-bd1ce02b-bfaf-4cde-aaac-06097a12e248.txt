A visualization is composed of a circular and a linear view, arranged vertically. The circular view displays the entire genome, with tracks showing an ideogram, point annotations, genomic ranges, and connections. Notably, the "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" tracks use blue and orange rectangles, respectively. Connections are categorized by colors representing variations such as "Translocation" and "Duplication." An interactive brush in the circular view allows linking to the linear view, focused on chromosome 1. The linear view includes ideogram, text annotations, point mutation scatter plots, and more range annotations, emphasizing "Insertion" and "Deletion" in distinct colors. The "Copy Number Variants" track presents quantitative data in gray.
