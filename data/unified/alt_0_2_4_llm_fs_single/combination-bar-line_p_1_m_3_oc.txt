A dual-track visualization employs a vertical linear layout to depict genomic data from a multivec file across chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The upper track showcases an overlay of point and area marks, stratified by categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4,' using distinct colors. Points define genomic positions while area marks display expression values. The lower track illustrates cumulative area plots for the same samples, further emphasizing comparative expression levels through category-based color coding. Both tracks include tooltips detailing position and expression data, aiding analysis.
