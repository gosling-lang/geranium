The linear bar chart visualization displays genomic data from a multivec file across the entire genome of hg38. Each bar represents a genomic interval on the x-axis, with 'start' and 'end' fields defining the genomic range. The y-axis encodes quantitative 'peak' values, presented through the height of the bars. These bars are uniformly sized with a value of 5 and colored in a distinct purple hue (#b59bf2). The chart is titled 'Basic Marks: bar' and serves as a 'Tutorial Example'. The overall layout is horizontal with the potential for dynamic exploration due to non-static properties and flexible zoom limits ranging from 1 to unlimited scale.
