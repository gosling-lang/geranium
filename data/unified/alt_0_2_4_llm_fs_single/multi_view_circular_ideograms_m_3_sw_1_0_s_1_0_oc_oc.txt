A circular visualization consists of two overlaying tracks. The outer track is a circular bar chart displaying genomic data from chromosome 1. The bars are positioned radially, with their height representing quantitative 'peak' values, while their color indicates different 'sample' categories among four specified. The inner track is a circular ideogram depicting genomic intervals from chromosome 1. Sections are colored according to various 'Stain' categories, each with specific color associations. The entirety of chromosome 1 is encapsulated within the circular layout, emphasizing the genomic position and expression across the sequence.
