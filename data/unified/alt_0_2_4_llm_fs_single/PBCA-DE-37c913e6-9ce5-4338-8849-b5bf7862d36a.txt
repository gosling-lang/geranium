The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view, with a focus on chromosome 1 of the hg19 assembly. The circular view includes:

1. **Circular Ideogram**: Displays entire genome with chromosome labels and genomic intervals.
2. **Annotation Tracks**: Show “Gain” with blue rectangles and “Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)” with orange rectangles.
3. **Connection Track**: Illustrates structural variations like Translocations, Duplication, Deletion, and Inversions in varying colors representing different categories.

The linear view displays:

1. **Ideogram**: Depicts chromosome 1 with bands and highlights.
2. **Text Annotation**: Marks “Putative Drivers” with annotated gene names.
3. **Point Mutation Track**: Scatter plot indicating mutations with distances to previous ones, colored by subtype.
4. **Indel and CNV**: Bars for insertions/deletions and copy number variations.

Interactive features include a blue brush in the circular ideogram linking to the linear view. The visualization provides a comprehensive genomic overview with multiple data layers for detailed analysis.
