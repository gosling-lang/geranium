This visualization consists of a circular view and a linear view stacked vertically. The circular view offers a complete genome overview with interactive elements, including an ideogram and several annotation tracks. These tracks illustrate chromosome information, putative driver mutations, gains, losses of heterozygosity (LOH), and structural variations like translocations and inversions. The tracks employ diverse visual encodings such as colored rectangles and connecting lines to represent categorical and quantitative data.

The linear view zooms into chromosome 1, presenting a more detailed inspection of genomic features. It includes ideograms, track-specific annotations, and detailed visualizations of point mutations and copy number variants (CNVs). Point mutations are displayed as scatter plots, with colors denoting subtypes, while CNVs use bars to indicate copy numbers. Insertion and deletion events are also highlighted with distinct color codings. Both views are linked via an interactive brush tool that allows navigation and selection, providing an integrated exploration of genomic variations across different scales.
