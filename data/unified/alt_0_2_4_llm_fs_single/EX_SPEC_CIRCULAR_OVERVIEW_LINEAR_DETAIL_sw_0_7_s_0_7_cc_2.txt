This visualization consists of two main components arranged vertically. The top component is a circular chart, featuring two tracks. The outer track is a circular bar chart that displays genomic intervals on the x-axis and expressions on the y-axis, stratified by samples. Colors encode different categories. The inner track is a circular chart with connections, depicting genomic interactions with varying connections—deletion, inversion, translocation, and tandem duplication—colored in purple. Two horizontal bar charts positioned below the circular view show genomic data on chromosomes 5 and 16. These linked bar charts are stratified by samples with distinct colors, providing detailed genomic positions through interactive brushing from the circular chart above.
