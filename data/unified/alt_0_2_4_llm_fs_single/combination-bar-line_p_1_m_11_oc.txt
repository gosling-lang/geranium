The visualization consists of two vertically arranged tracks in a linear layout, focusing on chromosome 1 with a range from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a scatter plot with points representing genomic positions on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis. These points vary in size based on quantitative values and are colored according to four sample categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Different rows indicate different samples. The bottom track is a line chart with lines indicating the same data fields and color coding as the scatter plot. These lines display the variation in expression across genomic positions, providing a clear comparison across the samples. Both charts enable detailed inspection with tooltips offering genomic position, peak value, and sample information.
