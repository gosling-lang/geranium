The visualization comprises a circular and a linear layout positioned vertically. The circular view provides a genome-wide ideogram with a blue interactive brush linking it to a detailed chromosome 1 view below. This circular view includes tracks such as a genomic ideogram, point annotations showing gene data, blue rectangles representing 'Gain', and red rectangles for 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)'. The connections in the inner track are color-coded for various structural variations like Translocation and Duplication.

The linear view, focusing on chromosome 1, mirrors these tracks and adds additional layers. It has gene annotations with directionality indicated by arrowheads, scattered colored points for 'Point Mutation,' and gray bars for 'Copy Number Variants.' Structural variations are shown again with connections, amplified by color coding for Gain and LOH. This comprehensive design facilitates multi-scale genomic data interpretation through a seamless transition from global to detailed chromosome views.
