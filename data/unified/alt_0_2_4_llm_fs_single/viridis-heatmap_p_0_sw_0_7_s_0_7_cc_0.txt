A heat map in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, displaying chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 of assembly hg38. The intensity of color encodes the 'peak' values, and the chart is divided into four horizontal rows representing different samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each row's colors range from light to dark orange, indicating variations in expression levels. This visualization includes interactive tooltips showing start and end genomic positions, peak values, and sample names.
