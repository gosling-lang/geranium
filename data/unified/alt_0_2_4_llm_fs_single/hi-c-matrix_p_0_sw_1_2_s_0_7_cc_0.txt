A visualization titled "Hi-C Matrix" overlays a matrix with multiple tracks to display genomic data. The main component is a heatmap matrix showing genomic intervals on both x- and y-axes and encoding expression values using a 'hot' color scheme. Overlaid on this are vertical and horizontal rules indicating genomic positions, colored in purple and sky blue, respectively. Another layer features bars with strokes representing different categories. The final layer displays points where both x- and y-axes represent genomic intervals, with point size related to quantitative data and colored pink. The overall structure is linear with a horizontal orientation, emphasizing interactive exploration of genomic data within a specified range. The layout is styled with dashed lines and a light gray background, providing a comprehensive view of chromosome interactions and annotations.
