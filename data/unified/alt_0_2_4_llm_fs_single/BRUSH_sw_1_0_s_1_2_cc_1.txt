A genomic line chart titled "Example: Brushing and Linking" is presented in a linear layout, using multivec data to visualize chromosome 1. The top track displays a green line showing the "peak" values along the genome, and incorporates a light blue interactive brush, linking to the detailed view below. The bottom track, with a pink line and a semi-transparent steel blue background, highlights a zoomed-in view of the genomic region from 200,000,000 to 220,000,000. Each track is assembled using the hg38 assembly, enhancing the interactive exploration of genomic data through brushing and linking.
