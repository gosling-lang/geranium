In the visualization, a linear view overlays a circular view, each providing genomic data insights. The circular view is an ideogram of the entire hg19 genome, enriched with tracks for 'Putative Driver' genes, genomic gains, and losses of heterozygosity (LOH). These are linked via an interactive brush, supported by detailed genomic connections illustrating structural variations like translocations and inversions. The linear view highlights chromosome 1, with annotation tracks for 'Putative Driver' genes and point mutations noted in a scatter plot, revealing mutation types such as C>A or T>G. These points are organized by expression and colored categorically. Additional tracks show insertions, deletions, and copy number variants, enhancing the clarity of genomic changes. Chart connections visualize interactions between genomic positions in aligned colors and strokes, aiding the identification of distinct mutation categories.
