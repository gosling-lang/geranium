The visualization is a genomic range annotation track titled "Cyverse-QUBES," focusing on chromosome 3, spanning from positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. The chart is structured in a linear, horizontal layout and stratified by strand categories, with two rows representing '+' and '-' strands. Gene names are displayed in black text, while gray triangles mark gene directions at the ends of gene positions. Light gray rectangles represent genes, whereas purple rectangles with purple stroke lines indicate exons. Gray lines connect genomic start and end positions. This visualization aims to provide a comprehensive overview of gene and exon placements within the specified genomic interval.
