A linear bar chart visualizes multivec data from the hg38 genome assembly. The x-axis displays genomic intervals, while the y-axis shows quantitative expression values. The data, derived from a sample, is encoded in pink bars, with heights representing the 'peak' field. The chart, titled 'Basic Marks: bar', is part of 'Tutorial Examples'. Featuring a straightforward layout with 960-pixel width and 210-pixel height, this visualization utilizes a bin size of 5 for data aggregation. The bars are uniformly sized, providing a clean representation of genomic expression data.
