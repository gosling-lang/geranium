The visualization features a linear arrangement with two vertically stacked tracks, both displaying data from chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a multivec bar chart with four rows categorized by 'sample' (sample 1 to sample 4), each row colored differently. The y-axis represents 'peak' values, allowing for comparative analysis across samples. The bottom track is a heat map with the x-axis divided into genomic intervals, where expression values are encoded using color intensity. Both tracks incorporate interactive tooltips showing genomic positions and corresponding values. The layout ensures clarity and facilitates the exploration of genomic data variations across samples.
