A Hi-C matrix visualization in a linear layout displays genomic interactions using a matrix and various annotations. The title "Hi-C Matrix" and subtitle "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations" describe the chart. It covers the genomic interval between 800,000,000 and 1,800,000,000, with both x and y axes representing genomic coordinates.

- **Track Details**:
  - **Matrix Track**: Displays genomic intervals on both axes, with expression values represented through color intensity on a 'hot' color scale.
  - **Vertical Line Track**: Shows genomic positions on the x-axis as sky blue lines.
  - **Horizontal Line Track**: Displays genomic positions on the y-axis as green lines.
  - **Bar Track**: Represents different genomic categories using bar strokes and color intensity.
  - **Point Chart**: Illustrates genomic data points with size corresponding to quantitative values, colored in purple with white strokes. 

The visualization uses hg38 assembly and includes overlays and styling details like dashed lines and opacity settings.
