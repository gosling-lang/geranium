A visualization featuring a circular and linear view of genomic data using the hg19 assembly. The circular view contains tracks including an ideogram, textual annotations, and genomic range annotations titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," depicted with blue and orange rectangles respectively. The linear view displays chromosome 1 details with expanded tracks for ideogram, gene annotation, point mutation scatterplots, and copy number variants. Mutations are color-coded, with structural variations indicated by distinct connections in multiple colors, such as blue for "Gain" and orange for "LOH." The views are linked via a brush for interactive exploration.
