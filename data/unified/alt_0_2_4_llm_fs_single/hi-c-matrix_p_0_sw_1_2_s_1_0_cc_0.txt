A Hi-C matrix visualization with a linear layout, displaying genomic intervals ranging from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 bp of the hg38 assembly. The visualization features overlaid tracks that visualize data as bars, rules, and points with pink and purple colors, indicating genomic interactions and annotations. The matrix shows intensity variations using a 'hot' color range to encode expression values across chromosomes 5 to 10. Vertical and horizontal pink lines represent specific annotations at 100,000 bp in chromosomes 2, 5, and 10. Points are encoded by quantitative values using size and are colored in purple, overlaid on the matrix to highlight specific genomic regions. The diagram is styled with light gray background and dashed lines for emphasis. The title is "Hi-C Matrix" with a subtitle "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations."
