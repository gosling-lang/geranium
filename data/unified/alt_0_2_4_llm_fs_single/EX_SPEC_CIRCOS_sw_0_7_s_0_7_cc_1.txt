A circular Circos visualization that showcases genomic data. The layout includes three distinct circular tracks: a bar chart, an ideogram, and a chart with connections. The bar chart displays genomic positions on the x-axis and expression levels on the y-axis, with bars colored in sky blue. The ideogram represents chromosome bands, with colors indicating different categories; it uses a rectangular mark to display intervals on the x-axis. The connection chart illustrates links between genomic positions, with color variations based on chromosomal regions. The tracks are overlaid in a stacked alignment for a comprehensive genomic overview.
