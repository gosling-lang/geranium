The visualization titled "Gremlin (O'Brien et al. 2010)" consists of linked linear tracks focused on Chromosome 5 of hg38. The top track displays an ideogram of Chromosome 5, with stained regions in black and pink representing cytogenetic bands. Below, connections across Chromosomes 4, 5, and 6 are visualized with colored links—blue, brown, and green—in separate rows, showing genomic segments and their locations. The subsequent track highlights connections within Chromosome 5 using green links. The "Region of Interest" view emphasizes the area between 68,000,000 and 71,000,000 on Chromosome 5 with blue links. Finally, the "Rearrangement View" offers a detailed look at a specific region between positions 69,276,000 and 69,282,000, featuring a large blue arc indicating genomic rearrangements. Together, these linked visualizations provide a comprehensive overview of segmental duplications and structural variations across Chromosome 5 with interactive brushes linking views.
