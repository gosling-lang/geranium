A linear heatmap displays a multivec file visualizing genomic data for chromosome 1, between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The chart is vertically arranged and consists of four rows, representing 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'. Genomic positions are displayed on the x-axis with color intensity encoding quantitative values of 'peak'. The color gradient ranges from light yellow to dark orange. Tooltips provide detailed information, including start and end positions, peak values, and sample names.
