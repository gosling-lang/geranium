A circular scatter plot visualizes genomic data from chromosome 12, covering the interval from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The plot displays data across six different categories, excluding ones labeled as "sample -". Each category is shown in a distinct color, and each circle of points represents the expression values (peak) for that category. The x-axis represents the genomic position, and the y-axis represents quantitative expression values, normalized to a domain of [0, 0.01]. The visualization uses a circular layout with points stratified in rows based on categories and colored nominally. The data is sourced from a multivec file and filtered to exclude unspecified samples.
