The visualization titled "Visual Linking" demonstrates interactive linking between views to detail genomic data for chromosome 1. It consists of three charts: a linear scatter plot, a linear area chart, and a circular line chart. 

1. **Linear Scatter Plot**: Displays genomic positions on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis, stratified by rows for the nominated samples — "sample 1" through "sample 4". The points are color-coded for each sample and cover the genomic interval 160,000,000 to 200,000,000.

2. **Linear Area Chart**: Positioned below the scatter plot, this chart shows genomic intervals on the x-axis and peak values as filled areas on the y-axis. It is stratified by sample categories, linking to the scatter plot above via an overlaying brush interaction. The brush allows for selection and zooming into specific genomic regions.

3. **Circular Line Chart**: Represents genomic data in a circular layout with genomic intervals on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis. Lines are color-coded according to the sample categories. This chart also includes an interactive brush, serving to update the detailed view in the linear charts.

The circular chart, along with the other charts’ interactive brushing feature, provides a detailed dynamic view of genomic data, enhancing exploratory data analysis.
