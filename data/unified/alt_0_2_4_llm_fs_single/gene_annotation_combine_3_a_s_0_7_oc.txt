A linear genomic visualization consists of three vertically arranged tracks, each aligned horizontally, displaying data from chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The first track, titled "Cyverse-QUBES," features gene annotations with text labels in black, right triangles in gray for plus-strand genes, left triangles in gray for minus-strand genes, light gray rectangles for genes, and purple rectangles for exons with purple borders. The second track provides a more detailed view of the gene structure, showing gray rectangles for genes, red rectangles for exons, and light blue rectangles for introns, all stratified by strand. The third track, titled "GmGDV," visualizes gene locations with blue arrows for the plus strand and red arrows for the minus strand, highlighting gene names in text above each annotation.
