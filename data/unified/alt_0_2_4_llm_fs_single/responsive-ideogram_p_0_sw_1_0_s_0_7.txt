The visualization represents a genomic ideogram track for chromosome 7, adhering to hg38 assembly. It consists of a linear layout with an overlay of textual annotations and symbols indicating regions and features along the chromosome. The ideogram is colored in shades of black, gray, and white to delineate various stain categories, while maroon triangles point towards the centromeric region. Gene labels and other textual elements are displayed in black and gray, sized adaptively based on visibility constraints. The chart is responsive, adjusting width and height automatically.
