The visualization titled "Single-cell Epigenomic Analysis" from Corces et al. 2020 displays linear tracks focusing on chromosome 3. The top track is an ideogram with varied density rectangles and acen region markers in maroon triangles. A red brush links this to the genomic detail view below, spanning chromosome 3 from base pairs 52,168,000 to 52,890,000.

The detail tracks depict epigenomic data for different cell types. Excitatory neurons are shown in pink, inhibitory neurons in green, dopaminergic neurons in blue, microglia in sky blue, oligodendrocytes in purple, astrocytes in dark orange, and OPCs in purple. Each bar chart reflects peak values along the genomic region.

A gene annotation track in navy and red outlines gene locations and exons, stratified by strand. Below, PLAC-seq data tracks present withinLink marks visualizing chromatin interactions. Overall, the design integrates multi-layered genomic data within a cohesive linear layout.
