The visualization is a linear genomic visualization of the E. coli genome, focusing on the interval of chromosome U00096.3 between positions 222,000 and 240,000. It uses a GFF3 file to display genes and is titled "GFF3 file" with the subtitle "E. coli genome, colored by gene type." The chart presents protein-coding, tRNA, rRNA, ncRNA, pseudogene, and unknown gene types in distinct colors: orange, blue, green, red, purple, and black, respectively. Genes are represented with right-pointing triangles for forward strand genes and left-pointing triangles for reverse strand genes, with corresponding rules extending to their genomic span. The chart includes gene names positioned slightly above the line, utilizes smooth path styling, and is stratified by strand. The visualization is interactive and supports varying visibility levels based on width.
