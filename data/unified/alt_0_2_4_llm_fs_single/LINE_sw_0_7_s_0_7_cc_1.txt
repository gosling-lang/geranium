The visualization is a line chart in a linear layout that represents genomic data using a multivec source. It covers the entire hg38 genome assembly, specifically focusing on 'sample 1'. The x-axis displays genomic positions, while the y-axis shows quantitative expression values, with lines encoded in sky blue. The chart, titled 'Basic Marks: line', also features a subtitle 'Tutorial Examples'. The line's thickness is consistent, set to a size of 2, providing a clear visual representation of fluctuations in expression values across genomic positions.
