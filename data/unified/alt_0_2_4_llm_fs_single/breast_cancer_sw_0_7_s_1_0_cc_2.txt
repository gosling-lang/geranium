The visualization is a linear genomic track for chromosome 1, featuring five distinct panels. The first panel displays a cytoBand ideogram with color-coded regions representing different chromosomal stains. The second panel shows a genomic position annotation track with directional triangles based on gene orientation, stratified by rows. The following two panels display genomic ranges as rectangles in sky blue and purple, representing different properties of tumor copy number variations. The last panel is a connection plot illustrating structural variants with lines in varied colors and strokes indicating categories like tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions. The data is integrated from multiple sources, including CSV and BEDDB files, providing a comprehensive genomic overview.
