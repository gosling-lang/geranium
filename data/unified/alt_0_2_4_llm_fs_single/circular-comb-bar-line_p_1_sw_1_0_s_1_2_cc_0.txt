A circular genomic visualization displays a multivec file for chromosome 1, ranging from 1 to 3,000,500. The left track features a circular line chart and scatter plot, with each line and point color-coded to represent 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' Points along the line indicate expression values, with their sizes scaled by the 'peak' data field. The right track is a circular bar chart illustrating expression levels by bar height, also stratified by sample categories using corresponding colors. This dual-panel representation allows comparative analysis across samples.
