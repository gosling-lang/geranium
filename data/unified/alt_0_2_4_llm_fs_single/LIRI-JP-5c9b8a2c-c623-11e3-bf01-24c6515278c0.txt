A circular and linear genomic visualization shows data for the human genome assembly hg19. The circular ideogram displays chromosome positions and is interactively linked to a detailed linear view of chromosome 1. This circular view includes tracks for indicating genomic gains (sky blue) and losses of heterozygosity (LOH, dark orange), as well as structural variations marked by connections in various colors representing different categories like translocations and inversions. The linear tracks offer more detail on chromosome 1 with annotations for putative driver mutations, point mutations (colored by mutation subtype), gene annotations with exon and intron structure, and annotations for insertions and deletions. These elements are shown using distinct shapes and colors to distinguish categories, such as rectangles and triangles.
