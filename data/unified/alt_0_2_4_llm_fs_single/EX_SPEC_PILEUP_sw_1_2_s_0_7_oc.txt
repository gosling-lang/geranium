The visualization is a linear layout of two tracks representing sequence alignment using a BAM file, focusing on chromosome 1 between positions 136,750 and 139,450. The top track is a bar chart displaying read coverage, with the bar height indicating the number of reads at each genomic position. Bars are colored silver. The bottom track, a pileup display, uses rectangles to show aligned reads, with colors indicating different structural variations: normal read, deletion, inversion, duplication, and other categories. The track features a legend specifying insert size as 300 bp.
