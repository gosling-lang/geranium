A circular area chart visualizes a multivec file displaying genomic positions of chromosome 1 in a range from 1 to 3,000,500. The chart is arranged vertically with a center radius of 0.5. It highlights four samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4') through separate rows, with each sample represented in a distinct color. The x-axis shows genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative values ('peak'). The visualization includes a legend indicating the sample categories with color coding and a tooltip providing details on genomic start and end positions, peak value, and sample name. The layout is static and horizontal, emphasizing clear separation for each sample category with white stroke lines.
