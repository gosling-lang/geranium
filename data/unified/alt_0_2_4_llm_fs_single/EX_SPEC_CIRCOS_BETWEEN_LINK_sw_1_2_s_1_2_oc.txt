The visualization is a circular layout titled "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements," composed of four distinct tracks. The primary track is a circular bar chart, employing a multivec data file to display genomic intervals on the x-axis and quantitative peaks on the y-axis, with bars colored in light gray. Embedded within this layout are two circular ideograms, each utilizing a CSV file depicting human cytoband data, with rectangles colored based on different stain categories. Finally, a circular chart featuring connections visualizes genomic segments from a CSV file, showing links primarily in black and light gray. The tracks are integrated with a stacking alignment, maintaining parallel arrangements within the circular configuration.
