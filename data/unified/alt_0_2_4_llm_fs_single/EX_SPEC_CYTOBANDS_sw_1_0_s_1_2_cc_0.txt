The visualization consists of a parallel arrangement of views across chromosomes 1 to 5, displaying genomic data using multivec and CSV files. Each view includes an area chart and an ideogram with text, rectangles, and triangles. The area chart represents genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis, colored by categories of samples. The ideograms show cytogenetic bands with textual labels. The bands are colored by density, with visible labels according to available space. Triangles indicate centromere positions in maroon. This linear layout highlights variations in peak expression and cytogenetic features across different chromosomal regions.
