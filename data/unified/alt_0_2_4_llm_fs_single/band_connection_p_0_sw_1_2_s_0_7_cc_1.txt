The visualization is a linear layout featuring seven tracks, showing genomic data on chromosome 1 between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. The data is a CSV file containing fields for start and end positions, which are highlighted using rectangles and connections. 

- **Rectangular Tracks**: These tracks use blue and green rectangles to indicate genomic intervals, with a stroke color of dark green (`#4C6629`). The rectangles display opacity at 0.15, and tooltip information reveals the start and end positions in genomic coordinates.
  
- **Connection Tracks**: The connections between genomic positions are represented with arched links using varying colors: purple, green, and pink. Lines are semi-transparent with a width of 0.8.

- **Data Source**: All tracks use data from the same CSV URL, specifying chromosome (`c2`) and genomic fields (`s1`, `e1`, `s2`, `e2`). 

This visualization illustrates regions of duplication and links between different genomic intervals within the specified range.
