The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view arranged vertically, linked by an interactive brush in the circular view. The circular view encompasses the complete genome, while the linear view highlights chromosome 1. The circular view features an ideogram, point annotations, range annotations titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' and line connections. The ideogram is connected through a blue brush to the linear view. Range annotations display different genomic patterns in blue and orange rectangles. Connections illustrate structural variations like 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' and 'Deletion.' The linear view includes similar tracks, with additional annotations: a gene track, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation,' and an indel track. Each point in the scatter plot, derived from a VCF file, is colored by 'SUBTYPE,' indicating mutation types. Indels are shown in rectangles for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion,' while CNVs display copy number changes with gray rectangles.
