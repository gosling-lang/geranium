A circular bar chart in a static layout visualizes genomic data across the entire hg38 genome. The chart encodes a vector file, where the x-axis represents genomic positions and the y-axis represents quantitative peak values. Bars, colored in pink, extend outward from a central point, creating a radial pattern. This layout provides a comprehensive view of genomic peaks across multiple chromosomes.
