A circular and linear visualization display genomic data for hg19. The circular view includes an ideogram, a point track for putative driver genes, two range tracks for 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' and color-coded lines indicating structural variations such as 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.' A blue brush links to a linear view, showing chromosome 1. The linear view has tracks for point mutations, insertions, deletions, and copy number variants, with scatter plots and rectangular annotations in various colors. Each feature's position and size correlate with genomic and quantitative data.
