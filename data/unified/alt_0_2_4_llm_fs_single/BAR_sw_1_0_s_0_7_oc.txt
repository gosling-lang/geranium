The image is a bar chart titled "Basic Marks: bar," which illustrates genomic data in a linear layout. It is part of tutorial examples using a multivec file for data visualization. The x-axis represents genomic intervals, while the y-axis shows expression values plotted as vertical bars. The chart is configured for the hg38 genome assembly and uses data from a single sample ("sample 1"). The visual encoding employs a quantitative scale for both the position and height of the bars, with a fixed size value of 5. The design is set to be non-static, allowing for dynamic adjustments within the specified zoom limits.
