The visualization is a circular plot featuring two main tracks. The left track is an overlay of a circular line chart and scatter plot, with the genome displayed on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. The data is stratified by four categories ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'), distinguished by different colors. Expression values are also represented by the size of the points. The right track is a circular bar chart with the same genomic data on the x-axis. Expression values are depicted with bars, and category differentiation is achieved through bar colors. The charts effectively map genomic positions across a specified interval on chromosome 1, showcasing expression variations quantitatively and categorically.
