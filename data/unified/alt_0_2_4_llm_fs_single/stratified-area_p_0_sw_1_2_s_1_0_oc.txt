The visualization is a linear arrangement of area charts representing genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. Displayed in a vertical layout with an 0.8 center radius, it features four rows for 'sample 1' to 'sample 4', delineated by color. Each row illustrates the 'peak' values from a multivec dataset, where the x-axis encodes genomic positions and the y-axis encodes quantitative values. The interface includes a tooltip with genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample names, highlighting the interactive aspect. Colors are consistent per sample, with a white stroke separating the areas.
