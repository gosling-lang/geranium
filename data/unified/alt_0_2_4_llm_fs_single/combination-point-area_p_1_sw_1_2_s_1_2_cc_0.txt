A linear visualization containing two vertically arranged tracks displays genomic data across chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500. The first track uses an area mark to depict quantitative data over genomic positions, stratifying rows by four samples with distinct colors (blue, orange, green, red). The second track is a scatter plot representing similar data points, where point size and color indicate expression levels and sample categories, respectively. The tracks are interactive, with tooltips providing detailed genomic and sample information.
