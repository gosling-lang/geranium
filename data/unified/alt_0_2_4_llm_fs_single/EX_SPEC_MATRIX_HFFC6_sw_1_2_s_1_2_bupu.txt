A horizontal layout visualization comparing Micro-C and Hi-C data for HFFc6 cells on chromosome 7, focusing on the region from 77,700,000 to 81,000,000. The main view contains vertically oriented bar charts showing genomic intervals. Tracks labeled 'HFFc6_H3K4me3' and 'HFFc6_ATAC' are represented with dark green and orange bars, respectively. A third track, 'HFFc6_CTCF,' displays navy blue bars with annotations using right and left triangles in pink and green, signifying genomic positions. Two matrix tracks provide Hi-C and Micro-C data, where data density is depicted through a purple color intensity gradient. The bottom bar charts, titled 'Epilogos (hg38),' feature various categorical colors representing types of genomic activity. The visualization is styled with a light grey background for clarity.
