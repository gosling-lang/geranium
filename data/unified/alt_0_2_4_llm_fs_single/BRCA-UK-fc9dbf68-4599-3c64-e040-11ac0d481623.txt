The visualization consists of a circular view and a linear view aligned vertically, centered around the genome assembly hg19. The circular view at the top includes an ideogram displaying chromosome bands, a text track for putative drivers, and two additional genomic range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' (in blue) and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' (in orange). These annotations represent genomic intervals on the x-axis. A link track connects genomic positions, color-coded based on structural variant categories like 'Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', 'Inversion (TtT)', and 'Inversion (HtH)'.

Below, the linear view delineates chromosome 1, using a blue brush in the circular view for selection. This section includes a detailed ideogram, a gene track with exon annotations, and textual annotations. The 'Point Mutation' track visualizes VCF data with points colored by mutation subtype, positioned by distance to previous mutation. Below are tracks for 'Copy Number Variants', showing quantitative variations in gray rectangles, and 'Insertion'/'Deletion' tracks marking such events in yellow and green, respectively. Vertical lines further indicate structural boundaries, maintaining synchrony with the circular view.
