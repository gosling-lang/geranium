The visualization is a heatmap chart titled 'HFFc6_Micro-C' displayed in a linear layout, representing genomic data from a matrix data file. The genome is shown on both the x- and y-axes without visible axis lines, emphasizing intervals. The color intensity encodes quantitative expression values, with a color range set to 'hot,' spanning from lighter to darker shades. The chart dimensions are 864x720, providing a detailed view of genomic interactions with a diagonal pattern. The visual is designed for analyzing genome-wide matrix data using the human genome assembly hg38.
