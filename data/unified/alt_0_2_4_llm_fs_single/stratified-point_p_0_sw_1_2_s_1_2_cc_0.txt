A multilayer scatter plot in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, illustrating chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The plot has four stratified rows labeled as 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Points are colored blue, orange, green, and red, respectively, according to sample categories. Point size represents the 'peak' data field, with varying opacity set at 0.5. The x-axis denotes genomic positions, and the y-axis shows quantitative expression values.
