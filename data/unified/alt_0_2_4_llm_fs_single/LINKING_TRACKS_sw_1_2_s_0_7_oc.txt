A linear visualization displaying genomic data from chromosome 2 in two stacked tracks. The top track is a line chart representing three samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each lineâ€™s color signifies different samples for ease of differentiation. The bottom track is an area chart depicting two samples: 'sample 1' and 'sample 2', with colors denoting each sample. Both tracks show the genomic position on the x-axis and expression levels on the y-axis, categorized by sample. The charts are part of a multi-track layout with interactive features allowing exploration of genomic intervals.
