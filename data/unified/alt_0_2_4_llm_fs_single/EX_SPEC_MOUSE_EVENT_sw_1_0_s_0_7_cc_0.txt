The visualization titled "Custom Mouse Events" demonstrates the customization of mouse interactions across five individual charts. 

1. **Bar Charts:**
   - **Individual Marks:** Displays genomic data on the x-axis with expression values as bars on the y-axis. Colored bars represent different categories, allowing mouse-hovering and range selection.
   - **Group Marks By Sample:** Similar to the previous chart but groups data by sample. Categories are color-coded, with interactive features like mouse-over and range selection.
   - **Group Marks By Genomic Position:** Groups marks by genomic position, showcasing interactions and category-based color differentiation. 

2. **Genomic Range Annotation Track:**
   - **Group Marks By Gene:** Presents a genomic range with text annotations. Genomic data shown on the x-axis, with gene names indicated and stratified by category with colored indicators.

3. **Ideogram with Text and Shapes:**
   - **Group Marks By Chromosome:** Displays a chromosome-wide ideogram with annotations. Includes text, rectangles, and triangles with distinct color assignments for categories. Mouse interactions allow grouping by chromosome.

The figure supports extensive interaction customization, including mouse hovering and selection, enriching the data exploration experience.
