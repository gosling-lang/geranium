The visualization represents insertions and deletions from a VCF file using a linear layout. The data spans multiple chromosomes, including chr2, chr5, chr8, chr12, chr17, and chrX. The x-axis shows the genomic positions, while the rows are categorized as "Insertion" and "Deletion." Each category is displayed with a unique colorâ€”orange for insertions and green for deletions. The rectangles' color and stroke denote the category type. The chart includes tooltips with genomic and mutation information, such as reference and alternative alleles, and quality scores. The subtitle for the visualization is "Insertions and deletions from a VCF file."
