A circular heat map visualization titled "Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts," subtitled "Heatmap," presents genomic data for chromosome 1, spanning an interval from 1 to 3,000,500. The visualization uses a circular layout with a vertical arrangement focusing on data from the hg38 assembly. The genomic positions are represented along the outer ring, with data from four samples displayed as concentric rings, each segmented into bins. The color intensity within these segments indicates quantitative peak values, with a legend on the right providing color scale information. The heatmap utilizes color to represent expression values, while rows are stratified by sample categories. The design leverages a fixed, non-interactive, circular layout with a center radius of 0.5. This approach effectively encodes genomic data visually, enhancing the understanding of distribution and variations across the specified genomic range.
