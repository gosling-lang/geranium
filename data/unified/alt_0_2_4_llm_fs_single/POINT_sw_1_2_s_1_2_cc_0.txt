Sure! Here's a detailed description for the visualization:

---

The visualization is a linear scatter plot representing genomic data from an hg38 multivec file. It is designed to display the entire genome across the x-axis, while the y-axis visualizes quantitative expression values. Each point on the chart represents a data peak, with the position and size of the points encoded by the 'peak' field. The points are uniformly colored in a soft pink hue. The chart's title is "Basic Marks: point" and it includes a subtitle "Tutorial Examples". The layout is linear, with specified dimensions of 1152x246 pixels, facilitating a clear view of the genomic intervals and their corresponding quantitative data.
