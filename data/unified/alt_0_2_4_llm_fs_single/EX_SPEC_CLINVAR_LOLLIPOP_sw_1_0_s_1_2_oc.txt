The visualization presents a genomic range annotation in a vertical arrangement, focused on chromosome 13. It includes three views, each depicting different genomic intervals. The tracks feature gene annotations using triangles and lines to indicate strand directions, along with exons represented by rectangles. Genes on the positive strand are shown in blue triangles pointing right, while negative strand genes are in red triangles pointing left. Overlaid are ClinVar data points, with bars and points color-coded to indicate clinical significance, including categories like 'Pathogenic' and 'Benign.' The bar heights reflect the significance count, and the multivec data highlights count variations across different significance categories. The entire layout emphasizes genomic features and their clinical interpretations, allowing detailed exploration of genetic data across specified intervals.
