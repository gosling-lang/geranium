A vertical bar chart visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 of the hg38 assembly. The chart consists of four rows corresponding to four samples displayed in different colors: blue, orange, green, and red. Each bar's height in a row represents a quantitative peak value for a given genomic position on the x-axis. The samples are distinguished not only by color but also by row, allowing for clear visual comparison of expression levels across the genomic region. Tooltip information provides start and end genomic positions, quantitative peaks, and sample names.
