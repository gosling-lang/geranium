The linear chart visualizes insertions and deletions from a VCF file across several chromosomes, including chr2, chr4, chr6, chr9, chr12, chr15, and chr22. Tracks are categorized by mutation types: 'Insertion,' shown in orange, and 'Deletion,' shown in green. Each rectangle's position along the x-axis represents genomic location, while color indicates mutation type. The subtitle is "Insertions and deletions from a VCF file." The data overlays a horizontal layout with chromosome labels annotated on the x-axis. Tooltip details provide genomic positions and mutation specifics.
