**Description**: This is a circular bar chart with a radial layout, visualizing genomic data from a vector dataset. The bars are colored in pink and represent quantitative values, with their length corresponding to the 'peak' field in the data. The genome is organized around the circle, with individual positions aligned along the x-axis at the top. The chart is static, with a center radius of 0.3, and covers the entire human genome assembly hg38, displayed in an outer circular track. The layout alignment is set to 'stack,' with 1008 units for both width and height, maximizing visual clarity of genomic peaks.
