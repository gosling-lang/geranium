The visualization titled "Gremlin (O'Brien et al. 2010)" displays data in a linear layout focusing on chromosome 5. The top panel features an ideogram with grey and black bands representing different staining properties, annotations based on categorical stain data, and a pink accent for the acen region. Below, connections between genomic segments are shown, colored by chromosome pairs (hs5, hs4, hs6) using shades of blue, orange, and green. A sky-blue brush highlights a region of interest for cross-referencing with linked views. The lower panels delve into specific subregions: "Region of Interest" and "Rearrangement View," showcasing detailed genomic rearrangements between positions 68,000,000 and 71,000,000, and 69,278,000 to 69,280,000, respectively. These views display within-link connections, emphasizing repetitive sequences with light grey strokes and opacity for a clearer visualization of structural variabilities.
