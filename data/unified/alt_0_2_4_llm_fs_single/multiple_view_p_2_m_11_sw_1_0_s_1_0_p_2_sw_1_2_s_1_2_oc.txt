The visualization consists of a vertical arrangement featuring two views: a top composite view with a circular line chart and an area chart, and a bottom detail view with a scatter plot. The title is "Visual Linking" with a subtitle indicating the interactivity. 

1. **Top View**: 
   - It contains a circular layout showing genomic data from chromosome 1, using a multivec file.
   - Four samples are displayed in rows, and each sample is represented by a different color.
   - A line chart encodes the expression values on the y-axis, with categories indicated by color.
   - The chart includes an interactive brush, allowing users to link to the other views and update display ranges.

2. **Area Chart**:
   - Displayed along with the circular chart, it similarly divides data into categories by color, showing expression levels as areas.

3. **Bottom View**:
   - A detailed linear scatter plot shows a specified interval (160,000,000 to 200,000,000) of chromosome 1.
   - Points represent quantitative peaks per sample, and color further indicates the specific sample.

Interactivity is emphasized, with brushes enabling dynamic updates to the detail view below. The multivec file includes samples categorized by "sample 1" through "sample 4." This visualization efficiently links a broad genomic overview with detailed exploration using colors and interactive elements.
