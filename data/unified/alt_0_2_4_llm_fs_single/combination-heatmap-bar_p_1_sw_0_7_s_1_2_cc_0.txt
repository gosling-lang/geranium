A linear, vertical arrangement of two tracks visualizes genomic data of chromosome 1 within intervals from 1 to 3,000,500. The top track features a multi-row bar chart, with each row representing samples 1 to 4, shown in distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. Each barâ€™s position on the x-axis represents genomic position, while the height indicates quantitative peak values. The bottom track is a heatmap where the x-axis represents the genome in intervals and the color intensity encodes expression levels. Both tracks are stratified by sample categories. The tooltip provides details on genomic positions and peak values based on user interaction.
