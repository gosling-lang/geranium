A linear, vertical layout showcasing three genomic data visualizations, with data from chromosome 1. The first view combines a line chart and a scatter plot, displaying peak values along the y-axis, stratified into four rows by 'sample' categories. The second view is a bar chart illustrating genomic intervals with peak minimum and maximum values. The third view is a scatter plot using points to represent peak values, with point size reflecting peak magnitude, and all charts featuring a shared color legend for sample differentiation.
