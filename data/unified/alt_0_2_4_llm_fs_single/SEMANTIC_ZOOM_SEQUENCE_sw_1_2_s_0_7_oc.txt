The visualization is a linear semantic zooming chart representing genomic data with a multivec file. It features stacked bar tracks colored to indicate base categories "A", "T", "G", and "C" across genomic positions. When zoomed in, text marks showing specific base pairs appear. In this view, the x-axis identifies chromosomes, while the y-axis represents quantitative counts. The chart title is "Example: Semantic Zooming" with a subtitle explaining that text marks appear during zoom. The bar chart colors are orange, green, blue, and purple, each corresponding to different base pair categories.
