In a vertical layout, this genomic visualization presents both a circular and a linear view. The circular view, featuring a blue interactive brush, spans the entire genome, and the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. The circular section encompasses multiple tracks: an ideogram, a track for text annotations, two tracks for range annotations, and a line-connection track. The 'Gain' track highlights genomic ranges in blue, while 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' uses red. Distinct colors in the line-connection track illustrate categories like 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.'

In the linear section, nine tracks are present, mirroring the circular view's types, with added tracks such as a gene annotation track and a scatterplot. The scatterplot, titled 'Point Mutation,' showcases VCF data, with each point reflecting the distance to a prior mutation. Colors in the scatterplot denote different 'SUBTYPE' data values. A VCF file details the first range annotation track with 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' rows, using yellow and green rectangles. The second range track, titled 'Copy Number Variants,' employs a CSV file, with bar positions indicating 'total_cn' values, and rectangles in light grey.
