A multi-view visualization features a circular line chart, a linear area chart, and a scatter plot, showing genomic data on chromosome 1. The circular chart displays intervals along the x-axis with expression values on the y-axis, stratified by categories denoted by color. An interactive brush links this chart to others. The linear area chart also presents genomic intervals with expression areas, color-coded for categories, and includes a brush for dynamic updates. The scatter plot focuses on a specific range between positions 160,000,000 and 200,000,000, showing expression as colored points for different categories. The visualization, titled "Visual Linking," highlights how changing the brush position and range adjusts detail views, aiding in data exploration.
