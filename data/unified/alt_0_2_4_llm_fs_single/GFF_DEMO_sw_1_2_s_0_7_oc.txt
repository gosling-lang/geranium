The visualization is a linear genomic map of the E. coli genome, focusing on a region from 222,000 to 240,000 on chromosome U00096.3. It is styled to enable smooth paths and depicts gene biotypes using distinct colors: orange for protein-coding, blue for tRNA, green for rRNA, red for ncRNA, purple for pseudogenes, and black for unknown types. The genes are represented with right and left triangles, indicating strand direction, and rules with triangle patterns symbolize gene locations. Gene names are displayed above their respective positions. The chart is stratified by strand, showing genes on positive and negative strands in separate rows, and utilizes text, triangles, and line elements to convey genomic information. The chart is titled "GFF3 file" with the subtitle "E. coli genome, colored by gene type."
