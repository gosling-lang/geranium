The visualization displays a linear bar chart annotated with horizontal and vertical dashed lines. The genome is represented on the x-axis, and expression levels on the y-axis, marked by pink bars. The overlaid tracks include both horizontal and vertical rules drawn from a JSON dataset, emphasizing genomic positions with purple and pink lines. The title "Rule Mark" and subtitle "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines" provide context for the visualization. The data originates from a multivec file focused on the hg38 genome assembly. The chart spans various genomic intervals, with the dashed style of annotations adding clarity to the expression values.
