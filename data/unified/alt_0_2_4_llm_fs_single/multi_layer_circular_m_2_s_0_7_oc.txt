A circular area chart visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart is divided into several rings, each representing samples with different colors. The area under the curve represents the 'peak' values of the samples, with distinct areas colored to reflect different categories, excluding 'sample -'. The layout is circular, with a genomic interval on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. The visualization is rendered using data from the hg38 assembly.
