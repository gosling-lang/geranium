This visualization consists of linear coverage and pileup tracks, utilizing a BAM file to demonstrate sequence alignment data for chromosome 1 between positions 136,750 and 139,450. The top track is a bar chart illustrating read coverage, where the height of the bars correlates with the number of reads aligned in specific regions; the bars are colored in silver. The bottom track is a pileup chart that visually represents individual reads using rectangles, with each rectangle's color indicating different types of structural variations. Categories include 'normal read,' 'deletion (+-),' 'inversion (++),' 'inversion (--),' 'duplication (-+),' 'more than two mates,' 'mates not found within chromosome,' and 'clipping.' The width and layout of the chart provide a detailed overview, aiding in genomic analysis. The title of the visualization is "Pileup Track Using BAM Data."
