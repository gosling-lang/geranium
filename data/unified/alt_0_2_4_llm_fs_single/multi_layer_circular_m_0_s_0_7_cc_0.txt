A circular scatter plot visualizes genomic data from chromosome 12, spanning from positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. Each point represents genomic intervals along the circular x-axis, with expression levels shown on the radial y-axis. The plot is divided into rows based on sample categories, with each category assigned a unique color, including blue, orange, green, red, purple, and brown. Data is filtered to exclude certain samples, providing a focused view on the relevant categories. The visualization utilizes a multivec dataset and maintains a circular layout, centered within a specified radius, showcasing the genomic data within a condensed, multi-layer format.
