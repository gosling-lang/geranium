The visualization consists of three vertically-arranged linear views focusing on chromosome 13. Each view contains gene annotation and ClinVar significance data. The gene annotation track displays genes as arrows oriented by strand (+ or -), with exons marked as rectangles. Text labels show gene names. The ClinVar track uses bars and points to denote the clinical significance of variants: 'Pathogenic', 'Likely pathogenic', 'Uncertain significance', 'Likely benign', and 'Benign', colored from pink to green. Bar height represents count, with a baseline at 'Uncertain significance.' The layout stacks tracks and aligns by significance categories, aiding in comparative analysis through genome intervals.
