**Description:**

This visualization presents a horizontal alignment of genomic annotations in a linear layout titled "Basic Marks: Triangles." The tracks utilize triangular marks to represent gene annotations, derived from a BEDDB file. Forward strand genes are depicted with blue right-facing triangles at their end positions, while reverse strand genes are displayed with pink left-facing triangles at their start positions. Each row is stratified by strand, allowing for clear differentiation by color. The transparency of the triangles is set at 80%. The visualization spans multiple chromosomes along the x-axis, providing a comprehensive view of gene orientation across the genomic landscape. The subtitle "Tutorial Examples" is included, emphasizing its educational context.
