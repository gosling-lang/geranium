The visualization consists of two vertically arranged linear charts focusing on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top chart combines scatter and line plots. It displays genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative values on the y-axis, representing 'peak' data from four samples. Points and lines are stratified by category rows, with samples assigned different colors: blue for sample 1, orange for sample 2, green for sample 3, and red for sample 4. The point sizes also reflect expression magnitude. The lower chart is a scatter plot, similarly showcasing the genomic positions against the 'peak' values. Points are colored according to sample categories, facilitating differentiation. Both charts offer interactive tooltips for detailed data insight.
