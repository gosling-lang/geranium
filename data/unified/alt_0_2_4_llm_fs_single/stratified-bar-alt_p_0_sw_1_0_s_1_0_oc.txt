A multi-row bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. The visualization includes four rows labeled as 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each row represents genomic data with bars, where x-values are genomic positions, and y-values represent the range of 'peak_min' to 'peak_max'. The bars are colored differently for each sample, with a legend included. A black stroke outlines the bars with a width of 0.2 pixels.
