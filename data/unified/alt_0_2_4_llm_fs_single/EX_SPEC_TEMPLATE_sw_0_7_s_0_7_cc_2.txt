A linear visualization in Gosling.js displays three tracks, leveraging track templates. The first track shows a gene annotation on chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000, with gene structures illustrated using gray arrows and rectangles, indicating exons and gene direction. The second track visualizes a sequence alignment on chromosome 1 from position 77,925,299 to 77,925,320, with bars representing base counts colored differently for "A," "T," "G," and "C." The third track is an ideogram of chromosome 1, showing cytoband patterns with varying stain colors. The visualization demonstrates the capabilities of Gosling.js for creating complex genomic visualizations with ease.
