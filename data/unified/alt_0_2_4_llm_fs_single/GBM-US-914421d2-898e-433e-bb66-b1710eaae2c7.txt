The visualization presents a comprehensive genomic analysis in two vertically arranged views: a circular and a linear view, connected by an interactive brush on the circular view's ideogram. The circular view encompasses the entire genome with multiple tracks, including an ideogram, gene annotations, and range annotations titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' depicted in blue and orange, respectively. The tracks are layered, providing visual connections between genomic positions, with structural variations categorized by color. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, mirroring the circular view's tracks with additional details. It includes detailed annotations with genes, point mutations, and copy number variants (CNVs). A scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' visualizes variant data points, colored by subtype. The layout enhances data exploration through interconnected, visually stratified tracks.
