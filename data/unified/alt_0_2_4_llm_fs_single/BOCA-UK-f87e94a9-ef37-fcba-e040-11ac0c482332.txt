The visualization features a circular and a linear view linked via an interactive brush on the circular ideogram, displaying the entire genome of hg19 for chromosome 1. Circular tracks include an ideogram, text annotations for putative driver genes, and genomic ranges for 'Gain' (blue) and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' (orange). The linear view offers detailed tracks: an ideogram, text annotations, and genomic range annotations for 'Gain', 'LOH', and 'Copy Number Variants'. It includes a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation', where each point's vertical position represents the distance from the previous mutation, colored by type (e.g., C>A, T>G). Connections between genomic positions signify structural variants like translocations and duplications, color-coded for various categories.
