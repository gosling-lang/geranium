A responsive HiGlass visualization displaying overlaid matrix tracks for chromosome 10. The chart uses a linear layout with genomic axes labeled on both x and y. There are two overlaid matrix views; the first uses the 'viridis' color scale to represent data intensity, while the second uses a grey scale. Both tracks are 400x400 pixels, encode expression values with color intensity, and are responsive to screen size changes. Intervals of the genome are shown as bars with quantitative legends for easier interpretation.
