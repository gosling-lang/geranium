A heat map in a linear layout visualizes a matrix from a multivec file, spanning a genomic interval from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 on the hg38 assembly. The x-axis and y-axis both represent genomic positions, marked as 'xs' and 'ys' respectively. Color intensity encodes quantitative values, using a range described as “hot” to depict variations across genomic intervals. The width and height of the visualization are 630 units each. The genomic positions feature axes, with the top axis showing intervals and none for the other.
