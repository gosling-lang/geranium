The visualization is a scatter plot in a linear layout, covering chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. It displays genomic data from a multivec file with four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Points on the chart are colored based on the sample category, and their positions represent genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis. The size of each point correlates with its expression value, and points have partial transparency with an opacity of 0.5. A legend is included to identify the sample categories. The tooltip provides additional details about start and end genomic positions, peak values, and sample names. The chart uses a gridline on the y-axis to enhance readability.
