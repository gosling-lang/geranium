A circular scatter plot visualization displays a multivec dataset from chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The genome is represented on the x-axis with intervals, while expression peaks are shown on the y-axis with points. The plot is stratified by rows for 16 categories, each represented by different colors. The chart's radial arrangement allows for displaying multiple quantitative domains such as 0 to 0.01 with varying opacities to differentiate peak ranges. This visualization is part of a reference study on graphical perception of multiple time series.
