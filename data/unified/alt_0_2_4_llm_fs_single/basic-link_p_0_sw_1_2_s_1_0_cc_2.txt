A linear chart titled "Basic Marks: Link" displays genomic data from a CSV file related to segmental duplications on chromosome 1, represented by arcs connecting genomic positions between intervals. The chart is set in the hg38 assembly, with genomic coordinates on the x-axis from approximately 0 to over 200,000,000. The arcs are colored in olive green, indicating links between the start and end genomic positions ('s1' to 'e1' and 's2' to 'e2'). This visualization aids in understanding genomic structural variations, specifically within chromosome 1, as outlined in the subtitle "Tutorial Examples."
