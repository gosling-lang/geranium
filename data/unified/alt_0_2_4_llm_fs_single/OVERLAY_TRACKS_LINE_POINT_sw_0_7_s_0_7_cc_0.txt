A linear layout visualization depicts genomic data from a multivec file in an overlayed track format. It covers chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The visualization includes four tracks, each representing a sample with distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The data fields 'position' and 'peak' dictate the x and y genomic and quantitative axes, respectively. This chart integrates line and point marks, with point sizes scaled by 'peak' values. Each track corresponds to a different sample category, with colors uniquely identifying them. The title is "Example: Overlayed Tracks."
