**Description:**

This visualization presents a Hi-C matrix in a linear layout, showcasing genomic interactions across specified intervals from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 on the x-axis. The matrix is visualized using color intensity to represent interaction frequencies, with a gradient from light to hot colors. 

The visualization includes overlaid tracks to enhance interpretation:

1. **Matrix Bar Track**: Displays genomic interactions on both axes as a matrix, with intervals indicated by color intensity.

2. **Vertical and Horizontal Lines**: Annotations with purple vertical lines and pink horizontal lines indicate specific genomic positions.

3. **Bar Overlay**: Encodes quantitative values as a bar matrix with distinct category strokes for chromosomes 6, 7, and 8.

4. **Point Track**: Highlights genomic regions with points whose size is determined by a quantitative variable. Points are in purple, with a range of sizes, and utilize white strokes to enhance visibility.

The visualization is interactive, allowing for detailed exploration of genomic data through matrix annotations and varied visual encodings, all within the context of the hg38 assembly.
