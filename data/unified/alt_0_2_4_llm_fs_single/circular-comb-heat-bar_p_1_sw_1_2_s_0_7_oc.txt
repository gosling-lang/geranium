The visualization features a circular layout displaying genomic data from chromosome 1 over an interval up to 3,000,500. It consists of two main tracks arranged horizontally. The left track is a circular bar chart representing four samples. Bars are stratified by rows, with each row corresponding to a sample, and color-coded to indicate different categories. The right track is a circular heat map where genomic intervals are represented by color intensity, showing expression values. Both tracks are interactive, with tooltips providing detailed information about genomic positions and values.
