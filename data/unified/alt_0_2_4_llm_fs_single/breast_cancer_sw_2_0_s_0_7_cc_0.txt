A linear visualization displays chromosome 1 with five tracks, utilizing a range of colors to indicate different categorical values. The first track is an ideogram using left and right triangles to denote genomic intervals. The second track features a genomic position annotation, with arrows indicating gene directionality based on the strand field, visualized in blue and orange. The next two tracks use rectangular bars to represent genomic intervals from datasets. Sky blue rectangles depict regions with a minor tumor copy number of zero, while purple rectangles represent regions with a total tumor copy number greater than 4.5. The final track illustrates structural rearrangements as connections between genomic positions, colored by structural variant types such as tandem duplications and translocations. The visualization uses data from multiple sources including CSV and BED files, and is configured to dynamically display various genomic features across chromosome 1.
