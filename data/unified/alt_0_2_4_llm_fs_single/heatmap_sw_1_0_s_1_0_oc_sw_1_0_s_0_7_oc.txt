The visualization is a genomic matrix heat map titled "HFFc6_Micro-C," based on the hg38 assembly. It displays interaction data in a 420x420 layout using a warm color gradient to encode quantitative expression values. The axes, both x and y, represent genomic positions without explicitly marked intervals, focusing solely on color intensity to indicate values across the matrix derived from a matrix-type data set.
