A linear layout visualization of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is presented, based on data from the WashU Virus Genome Browser, NCBI, and GISAID. The genome NC_045512.2, spanning positions 1 to 29903, is displayed. The first track, titled "NC_045512.2 Genes", shows gene annotations with pink rectangles and text labels. Below, the "S Protein Annotation" track categorizes genomic regions such as "receptor-binding domain" and "S1/S2 cleavage site" in various colors, aligned in rows. The "NC_045512.2 Sequence" track visualizes the sequence composition, with nucleotide bars colored by base type (A, T, G, C), and white text indicating bases overlaid on a sequence profile. The final track, titled "TRS-L-Dependent Recombination Events", features blue arcs representing recombination events across positions on the genome. An interactive brush allows for zooming into specific regions for detailed exploration. The visualization effectively outlines genomic features, protein annotations, nucleotide composition, and recombination events within the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
