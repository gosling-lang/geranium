The visualization is a linear ideogram depicting chromosome 7. It includes a main track that shows regions with different stain levels represented by varying shades of gray, black, and red for centromeres. The ideogram is annotated with text labels for chromosome segments, which are colored based on their stain level, using black, white, or maroon for centromeric regions (triangles). The x-axis denotes genomic intervals, and the entire setup is designed to be responsive, adjusting size to different viewports. This visualization provides a detailed view of chromosome 7 with gene names indicated on a greyscale background.
