The visualization is an area chart presented in a linear layout, representing a multivec file across the full genome of hg38. The x-axis displays genomic positions, while the y-axis quantifies expression levels using the 'peak' field, illustrated by an orange-shaded area. The chart is titled "Basic Marks: area" with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples", conveying the variation in expression across different genomic locations.
