The visualization features two stacked tracks in a linear layout, focusing on chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500 of the hg38 genome assembly. The top track presents a multi-sample area plot, where the genomic position is displayed along the x-axis and the peak values along the y-axis. The visualization is divided into four rows, each corresponding to a different sample, and differentiated by distinct colors, each representing 'sample 1' through 'sample 4'. The bottom track is a scatter plot, displaying the same genomic range. In this plot, the peak value is visually encoded both by the position on the y-axis and the size of the points, while the color of the points represents the sample categories. Opacity is set at 0.5, allowing for better visualization of overlapping data. Interactive tooltips provide additional information about genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample identities.
