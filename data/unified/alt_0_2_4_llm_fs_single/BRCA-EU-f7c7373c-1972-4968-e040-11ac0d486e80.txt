A circular view and a linear view are arranged vertically. The circular view includes an ideogram, a point annotation track titled "Putative Driver," and range annotation tracks showing "Gain" in blue and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in orange. Connections between genomic positions are displayed as lines in various colors, indicating structural variations such as 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.' These lines are categorized by the 'svclass' field. A blue interactive brush links the circular and linear views.

The linear view covers chromosome 1 and includes an ideogram, gene annotations, and a text annotation track titled "Putative Driver." It also displays a scatter plot named "Point Mutation," with points representing the distance to the previous mutation and colored based on the 'SUBTYPE' field. Other features include range annotations for "Insertion" and "Deletion," and a "Copy Number Variants" track showing quantitative data as bars with lightgrey color, further visualized in a CSV file.
