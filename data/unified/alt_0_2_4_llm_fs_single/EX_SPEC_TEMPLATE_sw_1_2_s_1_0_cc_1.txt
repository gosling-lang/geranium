A linear layout visualization using Gosling.js demonstrates track templates, featuring three distinct views. The first view displays a genomic range annotation track on chromosome 3, showcasing gene annotations between 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. Gene features are represented by arrows in gray, with labels. The second view illustrates a sequence bar chart on chromosome 1 between 77,925,299 and 77,925,320, featuring colored bars representing sequence bases 'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C', marked by their occurrence count. The final view is an ideogram of chromosome 1, highlighting banding patterns and labels like 'p31.1', 'q12', and others in varying shades, with a focus on structural features such as centromere locations indicated by red triangles. The layout aims to simplify complex genomic data visualization through the use of track templates.
