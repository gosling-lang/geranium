A circular scatter plot in a circular layout displays a multivec file, showing chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500. The plot is divided into four rows, each representing a different sample ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4'), and each sample is color-coded using blue, orange, green, and red. The size and position of points represent the 'peak' data field, visible on the radial axis. The opacity of points is set to 0.5. The plot includes a tooltip providing additional genomic and sample information when interacting with the points. The plot is designed to be non-interactive and is statically arranged in a vertical layout.
