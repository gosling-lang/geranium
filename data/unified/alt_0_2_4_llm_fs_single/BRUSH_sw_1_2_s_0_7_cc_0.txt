The visualization consists of two linear line charts displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, with interactive brushing for linking between charts. The top chart shows a line in sky blue, illustrating expression values along the x-axis representing genome positions. The bottom chart is titled "Example: Brushing and Linking" and features a purple line. Both charts use data from a multivec file, with genomic positions as the x-axis and peak values as the y-axis. An interactive brush in the top chart highlights a specific genomic interval, corresponding to a detailed view in the bottom chart, set against a steel blue background. The layout is horizontal with specified assembly as hg38.
