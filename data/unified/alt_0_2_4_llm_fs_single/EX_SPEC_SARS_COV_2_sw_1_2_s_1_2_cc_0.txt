The visualization titled "SARS-CoV-2" consists of two main linear views. The first view, titled "NC_045512.2 Genes," shows gene annotations from positions 1 to 29,903 using green rectangles with sky blue triangular lines and text for gene symbols. A brush interaction allows linking to detailed views. The second view contains several tracks aligned vertically. The first track, "S Protein Annotation," categorizes regions such as the receptor-binding domain and heptad repeats, using distinct colors. The "NC_045512.2 Sequence" track visualizes nucleotide composition with colored bars representing bases A, T, G, and C. The final track, "TRS-L-Dependent Recombination Events," uses light blue arcs to indicate recombination events. Data is sourced from WashU Virus Genome Browser, NCBI, and GISAID.
