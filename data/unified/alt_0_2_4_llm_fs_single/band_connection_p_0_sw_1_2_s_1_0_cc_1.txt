The visualization presents genomic intervals from chromosome 1, covering positions 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. It includes seven charts arranged linearly with three tracks of rectangles and four between-link tracks. The rectangles are colored green, sky blue, and pink, representing genomic regions. The between-link tracks connect genomic positions and are colored purple, green, and pink to highlight genomic duplication or rearrangement events. Data is sourced from a CSV file, visualized with soft color opacity to emphasize connections between regions.
