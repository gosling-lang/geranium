The visualization is a scatter plot titled "Basic Marks: point" with a subtitle "Tutorial Examples." It is presented in a linear layout showing genomic data of the hg38 assembly. The x-axis represents the genome using genomic positions labeled with chromosome numbers (chr1, chr2, etc.), while the y-axis shows quantitative expression values referred to as "peak." Each data point on the chart is represented as a sky-blue bubble, with the size of the bubbles proportionate to the expression values. The visualization highlights the distribution of expression values across different genomic positions, specifically categorized within "sample 1," using a multivec data type accessed from a specified URL. The chart effectively uses color and size to encode data values, providing insights into genomic information.
