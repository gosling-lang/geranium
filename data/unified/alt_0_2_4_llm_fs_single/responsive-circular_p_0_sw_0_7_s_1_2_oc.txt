A circular bar chart displays a multivec file visualizing data from chromosome 12, ranging from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. It features multiple tracks with bars representing expression values along the y-axis. The chart is stratified by categories such as 'sample 1' to 'sample 16', excluding 'sample -', each encoded with distinct colors. Bar opacity varies according to the height of the track, using responsive specifications to adapt between circular and linear layouts based on the aspect ratio. This dynamic design is inspired by graphical perceptions of multiple time series, as referenced by Javed et al., TVCG 2010.
