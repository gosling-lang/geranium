A circular layout visualization featuring two tracks displays genomic data. The left track depicts an area chart representing genomic positions along chromosome 1, with expression values stratified by rows corresponding to four samples. Each sample is colored distinctly in the legend, providing insight into expression patterns. The right track is a circular chart illustrating genomic connections as arcs, with intervals on chromosome 1 represented on the x-axis. Arc colors indicate categories based on genomic starting positions, enhancing visibility of structural variations. This visualization is static, centered on chromosome 1, covering positions from 1 to 3,000,500.
