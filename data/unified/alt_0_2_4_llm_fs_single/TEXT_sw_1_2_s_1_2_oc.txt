In a linear layout, this visualization presents a textual representation of genomic data from a multivec file, spanning the entire genome (hg38 assembly). Each character represents a base ('A', 'T', 'G', 'C'), with the height corresponding to the 'count' value of each base. The colors—orange, green, blue, and pink—encode the different base categories. The x-axis displays genomic intervals, while the y-axis shows quantitative values. This chart is titled 'Basic Marks: Text', and has the subtitle 'Tutorial Examples'.
