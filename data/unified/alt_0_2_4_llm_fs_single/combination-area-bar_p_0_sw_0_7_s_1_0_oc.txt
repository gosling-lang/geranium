A linear visualization displays genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The visualization is arranged vertically with two tracks.

The upper track is an area chart depicting the quantitative expression levels ('peak') stratified by four samples ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'). The x-axis represents genomic positions, and the y-axis displays expression values. The areas are colored individually for each sample.

Below, the second track shows a bar chart representing the range of expression values. Bars are grouped by sample, color-coded similarly, and display minimum and maximum values ('peak_min' and 'peak_max') on the y and ye-axes. Both tracks feature legends for sample identification and interactive tooltips providing detailed data information at various positions.
