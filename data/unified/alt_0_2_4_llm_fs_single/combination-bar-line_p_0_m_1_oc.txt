A linear visualization with a vertical arrangement represents chromosome 1 from base 1 to 3,000,500 using multivec data. The top chart is a scatter plot, displaying genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, color-coded by categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4.' The bottom track overlays scatter and line plots, stratified by rows for each sample category. Line thickness indicates expression magnitude. The visualization includes interactive tooltips showing genomic start, end positions, expression values, and sample categories. The layout is configured with center radius at 0.8.
