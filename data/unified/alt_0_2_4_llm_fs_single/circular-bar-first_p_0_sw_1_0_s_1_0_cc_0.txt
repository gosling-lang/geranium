A circular bar chart in a circular layout visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The data is stratified into four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The height of the bars represents the 'peak' value, with each category displayed in different colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The chart includes tooltip interactions displaying genomic start and end positions, the peak value, and the sample category. Grid lines are present for enhanced readability.
