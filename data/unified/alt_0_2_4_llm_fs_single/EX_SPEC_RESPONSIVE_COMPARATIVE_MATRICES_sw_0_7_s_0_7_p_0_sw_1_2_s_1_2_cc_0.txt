A multi-layered visualization showcases two overlaid genomic heatmaps in a linear layout, both mapping data on chromosome 10. The first track presents a matrix with genomic intervals on the x- and y-axes, using shades of grey to encode quantitative values. The second track is similarly structured but employs a color gradient from yellow to orange to represent different intensity levels. Together, these tracks provide a detailed view of genomic interactions, with color intensity indicating expression values. This visualization is responsive, allowing for size adjustments based on width measurements. The interactive elements and alignment facilitate comprehensive genomic analysis.
