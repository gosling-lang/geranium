The visualization presents a genomic linear layout showing segments of chromosome 1 between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. Multiple tracks include rectangle marks and connections (link marks) to represent data from a CSV file indicating segmental duplications. Rectangles are colored in purple, sky blue, and green, indicating different genomic fields. Links between segments are displayed in green and pink, illustrating connections between genomic positions. The visualization utilizes opacity and stroke styling to indicate density and separation of data, offering an overview of segmental distribution and interaction within the specified genomic region.
