Based on the provided JSON specification and processed data, this visualization is an overlaid Hi-C matrix plot featuring multiple genomic annotations on a linear layout. The main track employs a 'matrix' mark to display chromosome interactions, with both axes representing genomic intervals. Intensity of the color encodes expression values, shown in a 'hot' color range. Additional layers include vertical and horizontal genomic rules colored in pink, which delineate specific genomic locations across chromosomes 2, 5, and 10. Another matrix layer uses dashed strokes to indicate categorical variations across chromosomes 6, 7, and 8. The final overlaid track displays points, with the genome represented on both axes, and point size proportional to expression values. These points are colored sky blue and outlined in white, emphasizing different categories of genomic data. Overall, the visualization encapsulates complex genomic interactions and annotations, serving as a comprehensive representation of Hi-C data using matrix and point symbols. The visualization comes with a legend for quantitative data, enhancing interpretability. The title is 'Hi-C Matrix' with a subtitle 'Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations,' indicating the focus on chromosome interaction visualization.
