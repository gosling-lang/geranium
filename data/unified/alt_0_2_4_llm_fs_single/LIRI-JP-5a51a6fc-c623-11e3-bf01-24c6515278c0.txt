The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view, linked by an interactive blue brush. The circular view represents the entire human genome (hg19) with five tracks: an ideogram, point annotations, two range annotations, and a link track. The ideogram shows chromosomal bands with a brush for interaction. The point annotations display genetic data with labels. The range annotations indicate 'Gain' in blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity' in orange. The link track connects genomic positions with different colors representing variations such as 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' etc. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, with additional tracks including gene annotations, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation,' and two inset range annotations. The scatter plot visualizes mutations with point positions indicating distance to previous mutations, colored by 'SUBTYPE' categories. Inset annotations display 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' with respective yellow and green rectangles, and 'Copy Number Variants' with grayscale bars.
