The visualization, titled "Example: Overlay Tracks," is a genomic track chart in a linear layout displaying data from chromosome 3. The chart uses overlay tracks to represent variant significance with bars and points. Each genomic interval is represented along the x-axis. The height of the bars corresponds to various significance categories, while the points provide additional data differentiation. Categories such as "Pathogenic," "Likely_pathogenic," "Uncertain_significance," "Likely_benign," and "Benign" are shown using distinct colors: dark orange for "Pathogenic," black for "Uncertain_significance," and green shades for "Likely_benign" and "Benign." The chart includes an interactive legend to enhance readability and interpretation. The data is sourced from a BEDDB file located online, focusing on significance values that are nominally typed and structured along the y-axis. The chart has a grid for better visual alignment and interpretation of the variant data.
