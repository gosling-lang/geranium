A circular bar chart visualizes genomic data from a vector file, using a circular layout with bars representing expression peaks. The entire genome is displayed on the x-axis, oriented horizontally. The height of each purple bar indicates the quantitative value of 'peak' at each genomic position. The static visualization spans a width and height of 588 units, utilizing the hg38 assembly. The chart's center radius is set at 0.3, stacking bars around the central area to form a complete circular view.
