The visualization consists of a circular and two linear views arranged vertically. The circular view at the top displays genomic intervals using a multivec file with colored bar tracks representing samples 1 to 4. Each bar's color corresponds to the sample category, and the track is stratified by these samples. The center of the circular view features connections linked to specific genomic positions, encoded by stroke color with categories like deletion, inversion, translocation, and tandem-duplication.

Below, the linear views display bar charts for chromosomes 5 and 16. These charts show genomic data with bars representing expression levels stratified by sample categories. Each linear view is individually colored, with chromosome 5 in blue and chromosome 16 in red, providing an interactive, detailed look at selected genomic regions linked through brushes from the circular chart. The assembly used is hg38, with specific styling attributes like stroke and opacity enhancing the visualization's clarity and detail.
