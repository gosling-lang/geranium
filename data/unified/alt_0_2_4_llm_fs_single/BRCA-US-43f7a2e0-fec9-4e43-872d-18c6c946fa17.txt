A genomic visualization combining a circular and linear layout depicts structural variations and mutations, using data from different file formats such as CSVs and VCFs. The circular view, featuring an ideogram and tracks for gain and loss of heterozygosity, reveals structural variations via line connections colored by category, including 'Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', and others. The linear view corresponds to chromosome 1 and includes an ideogram, mutation scatter plot distinguishing subtypes, range annotations for mutations and copy number variants, and text annotations indicating putative drivers. A blue interactive brush links the circular and linear views.
