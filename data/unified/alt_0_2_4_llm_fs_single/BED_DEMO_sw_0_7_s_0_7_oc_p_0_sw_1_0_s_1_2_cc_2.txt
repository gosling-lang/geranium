A linear visualization of chromosome 1 from 1 to 2,000,000 showcases various BED file specifications. The top track titled "BED12: All 12 standard fields" displays genomic intervals with pink rectangles. The second track, "BED6: A file with the first 6 BED fields," similarly uses pink rectangles. The "BED6+6: A file with the first 6 BED fields, and 6 custom fields" track uses green rectangles. Lastly, "BED12+1: A file with all 12 standard fields, and a single extra custom field" utilizes sky blue rectangles. Each track features black borders around rectangles, indicating genomic positions on the x-axis.
