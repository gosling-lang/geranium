The visualization consists of two circular charts arranged vertically, depicting genomic data for chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The layout is defined as circular with a center radius of 0.5. The left chart combines a line and scatter plot, where genomic positions are represented on the x-axis, and expression values are visualized with lines and points on the y-axis. Each sample, labeled from 1 to 4, is shown in different colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The right chart is a bar visualization where the height of each bar represents expression values, with colors indicating different samples. Both charts use multivec data type, supporting four sample categories, and are designed for interactive exploration with genomic positions highlighted in tooltips.
