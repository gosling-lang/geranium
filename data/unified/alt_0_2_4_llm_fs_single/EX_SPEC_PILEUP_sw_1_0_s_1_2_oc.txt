The visualization is a linear layout displaying a genomic pileup using BAM data, focused on chromosome 1 between positions 136,750 and 139,450. The top track, a coverage bar chart titled "example_higlass.bam," uses silver bars to denote the alignment coverage on the y-axis. The lower track illustrates a pileup of individual reads using rectangles, also titled "example_higlass.bam." This track is stratified into rows by categories, such as "deletion (+-)," "inversion (++)," among others, each color-coded like yellow for deletions or red for reads not found within the chromosome. The chart includes a legend highlighting the insert size of 300bp.
