A visualization consisting of both circular and linear views. The circular view includes an ideogram, a point annotation track titled "Putative Driver," and two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)." The circular layout also features a within-link track showing connections between genomic positions, categorized by structural variations such as 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' and 'Deletion' in various colors. A blue interactive brush links the circular view to the linear view, focusing on chromosome 1. The linear view expands upon the circular view with additional tracks, including a gene annotation track, scatter plot titled "Point Mutation," and tracks showing insertions and deletions in different colors. The scatter plot visualizes mutation distances, while the "Gain" and "LOH" tracks show genomic ranges, colored respectively in sky blue and dark orange. Combined, these elements provide a comprehensive visual representation of genomic data for assembly hg19.
