A circular bar chart visualizes genomic data from a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 12 within the range of 5,000,000 to 15,000,000 base pairs. The chart is divided into multiple concentric tracks, each representing different samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 6', 'sample 7', and 'sample 8'. The chart employs various colors to distinguish between samples, including blue, orange, green, red, purple, and brown. Each track displays expression peaks on the y-axis without axis labels. The visualization utilizes a filtered dataset that excludes certain samples for clarity. The circular layout provides a comprehensive view of the genomic intervals and corresponding expression levels.
