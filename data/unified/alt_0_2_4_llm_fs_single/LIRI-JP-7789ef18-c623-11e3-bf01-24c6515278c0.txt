The visualization comprises a circular and a linear view arranged vertically, linked by a blue interactive brush. The circular view encapsulates the entire genome, while the linear view zooms into chromosome 1. The circular section features tracks such as an ideogram, point annotations, range annotations labeled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' and a connection track showing structural variants. These variants are color-coded by categories like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.'

The linear view mirrors these tracks and includes additional ones: a gene annotation track with exon intervals displayed as triangles, a 'Point Mutation' scatterplot with diverse subtype color coding, showing mutation distances, and a 'Copy Number Variants' track displaying bars representing variation magnitude. The entire layout employs the hg19 assembly, ensuring genomic accuracy. Each track is meticulously styled, with options for user interaction, enhancing the exploration of genomic data across multiple scales.
