A linear arrangement displaying genomic data for chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The vertical alignment of views includes a track titled 'IGV', visualizing gene annotations. Blue text labels indicate gene names mapped to their genomic positions. Blue rectangular bars represent the extent of each gene, with directional arrows (white triangles) indicating strand orientation: left for negative and right for positive strands. The visualization is color-coded in sky blue for both text and rectangles, enhancing readability of genomic features.
