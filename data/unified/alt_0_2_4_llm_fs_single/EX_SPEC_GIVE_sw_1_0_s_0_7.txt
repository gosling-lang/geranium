A genomic visualization composed of two linear views, each highlighting a different chromosome segment. The title is "GIVE" with a subtitle "Reimplementation of GenoCAT examples." The top segment, spanning chromosome 17 from 1,000,000 to 50,000,000, includes tracks displaying genes using navy blue rectangles. The tracks are arranged in rows based on strand orientation. Three aligned bar charts, colored in light purple, represent quantitative data from vector files, showcasing peaks on the y-axis. An ideogram track at the bottom displays the cytogenetic banding patterns with color-coded white rectangles, right triangles, and left triangles. Additionally, a rect track with nominal color encoding portrays chromosome alignments. The bottom segment visualizes chromosome 1 from 110,000,000 to 112,000,000 in a similar arrangement, focusing on gene annotations and peak values within the same intervals. The layout emphasizes clear genomic interval demarcation and data overlay utilization.
