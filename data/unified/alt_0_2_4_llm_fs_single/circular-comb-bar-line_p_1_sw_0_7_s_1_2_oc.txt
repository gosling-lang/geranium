The visualization comprises two circular tracks, each displaying genomic data for chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The left track combines a circular line chart with a scatter plot, illustrating the expression values of four samples ('sample 1' to 'sample 4') as points and lines. The samples are color-coded for distinction, and the size of points indicates the magnitude of expression values. The right track presents a circular bar chart, where bars depict expression levels across genomic positions, also differentiated by sample colors. Both tracks are static, and the circular arrangement facilitates a compact visualization of multivec data.
