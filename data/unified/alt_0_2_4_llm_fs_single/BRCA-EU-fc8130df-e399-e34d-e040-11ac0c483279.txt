The visualization showcases both circular and linear views of the hg19 genome assembly. The circular layout features an ideogram, a text annotation track titled "Putative Driver," two range annotation tracks for "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and a link track showing structural variants. The ideogram is linked to a detailed linear view displaying chromosome 1. The linear view includes similar tracks with additional details: gene annotations, point mutations, and copy number variants. Data is colored based on categories such as "Gain," "LOH," "Translocation," and others, enabling the visualization of complex genomic interactions and variations.
