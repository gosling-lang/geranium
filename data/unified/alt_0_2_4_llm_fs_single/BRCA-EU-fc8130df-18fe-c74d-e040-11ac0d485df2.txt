A visualization with a circular and a linear view demonstrates genomic data from the hg19 assembly. The circular view features an ideogram, point annotation, range annotation, and connection tracks. The ideogram, titled "Ideogram," utilizes color-coded rectangles to represent genomic categories. The point annotation track titled "Putative Driver" displays black text annotations. The range annotations, labeled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," showcase genomic intervals in blue and orange rectangles, respectively. Connection lines indicate structural variations like 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion,' colored accordingly.

The linear view, linked by a blue brush from the circular view, focuses on chromosome 1. It contains a similar set of tracks with additional elements, including a gene and a scatterplot. The scatterplot, titled "Point Mutation," plots VCF data with points colored by mutation subtype (e.g., C>A, C>G), positioned by distance to previous mutation. Other tracks illustrate insertions and deletions from a VCF file and copy number variants in gray bars. The interactive design allows exploration of genomic features through linked views.
