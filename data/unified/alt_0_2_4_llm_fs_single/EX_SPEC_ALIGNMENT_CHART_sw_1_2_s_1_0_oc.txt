**Description:**

This visualization consists of two linked views, showcasing genomic data in linear layout tracks. The first view includes three tracks: a bar chart titled "Gap" using gray bars to depict gap values along the genomic axis, a "Conservation" bar chart with color gradients representing conservation scores, and a heatmap-like chart displaying multiple sequences. The sequences are stratified by rows, with distinct colors representing different bases. The second view overlays a broad genomic region with color-coded rectangles, providing a comprehensive overview of sequence data, conservation, and gaps, and features a lookup brush for interaction. Both views focus on an interval from position 350 to 396, with zoom limits extending from 1 to 396. The dataset is assembled from CSV files through an external source.
