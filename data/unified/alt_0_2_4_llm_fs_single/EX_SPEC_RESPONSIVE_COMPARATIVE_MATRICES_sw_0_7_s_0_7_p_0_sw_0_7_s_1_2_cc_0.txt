The visualization is composed of two overlaid matrix tracks representing genomic intervals on both x- and y-axes. The first matrix track displays data in shades of pink, indicating expression levels through color intensity. The second matrix track exhibits data in shades of grey, also encoding expression values by color intensity. The visualization, set in a linear layout, focuses on chromosome 10 and uses a common linking ID to synchronize both tracks. The layout is responsive, adapting to screen width, and includes a horizontal arrangement. The chart prominently features intervals from 50,000,000 to 100,000,000 on the chromosome, with the first track spanning the lower-left and the second track the upper-right of the matrix.
