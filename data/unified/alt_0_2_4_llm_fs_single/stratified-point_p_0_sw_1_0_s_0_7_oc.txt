The visualization is a scatter plot arranged in a vertical layout, displaying genomic data across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. Each point's position and size represent the 'peak' values from a multivec file, stratified into rows by the 'sample' category, with four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. These are colored distinctly for differentiation. The plot is interactive with tooltips providing additional genomic context like start and end positions. The transparency of points is set to 50%, enhancing visibility of overlapping data.
