A circular view and a linear view are stacked vertically, with a blue interactive brush linking them. The circular view encompasses the entire genome, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. The circular view includes an ideogram and four layers showing genomic data: a text annotation track (Putative Driver), two range tracks ('Gain' in blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in dark orange), and a connections track with structural variant links in various colors indicating different structural variations. In the linear view, an ideogram is followed by a text track and a series of plots: a scatterplot of point mutations colored by subtype, an indel track with 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' annotations, and a series of genomic range tracks representing different structural variations, including copy number variants in gray. The entire visualization uses a consistent color scheme for structural variants, with categories like 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and various inversions.
