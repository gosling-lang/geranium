A circular line chart visualizes genomic data from chromosome 12, spanning positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. This visualization consists of multiple concentric line plots, where each line represents genomic peaks for different samples. The chart is stratified by rows categorized by 'sample,' comprising 16 distinct samples. Each line is uniquely colored with varying opacity levels depending on the peak value range, divided into five domains: [0, 0.01], [0, 0.0025], [0.0025, 0.005], [0.005, 0.0075], and [0.0075, 0.01]. This configuration is designed to reveal the relative expression levels across different samples. The reference for this data visualization technique is Javed et al.'s study on graphical perception of multiple time series.
