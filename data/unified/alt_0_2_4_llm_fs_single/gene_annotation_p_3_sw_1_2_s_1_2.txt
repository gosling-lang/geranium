A genomic visualization in a linear layout shows gene annotations along chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. This figure comprises six tracks, each labeled with a title indicating its source: 'GmGDV,' 'Cyverse-QUBES,' 'Corces et al.,' 'HiGlass,' 'IGV,' and an unlabeled annotation. Each track stratifies data by strand orientation, marked by different shapes and colors. Gene names are displayed as text or symbols, with arrows indicating transcription direction. Exons are represented as rectangles, highlighted in different colors across tracks, such as gray, light gray, and purple, with genes shown in blue and red. Rectangular boxes also illustrate introns in one track, colored cyan. This visualization effectively demonstrates gene structure, providing an integrated view of multi-source genomic data.
