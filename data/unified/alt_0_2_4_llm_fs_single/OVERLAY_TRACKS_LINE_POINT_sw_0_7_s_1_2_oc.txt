The visualization titled "Example: Overlayed Tracks" presents a linear layout featuring a combination of line and scatter plot tracks. It displays a multivec file along chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. The x-axis represents genomic positions, and the y-axis illustrates expression levels denoted by the 'peak' field. Lines and points are used to signify data, with each row corresponding to different samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The size of the points is dependent on quantitative measurements of 'peak', varying from 0 to 6. Each sample category is represented by distinct colors for easy differentiation.
