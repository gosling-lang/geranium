A linear visualization comprises two line charts, each representing genomic data from a multivec file. The top chart displays genome-wide data from chromosome 1, using sky blue lines to indicate expression on the y-axis. An interactive brush allows selection, linking the data to the bottom chart. The bottom chart is titled "Example: Brushing and Linking" and focuses on a specific genomic interval from 200,000,000 to 220,000,000 within chromosome 1. It uses green lines to represent expression, set against a steel blue background with slight transparency for visual emphasis. Both charts show genomic positions on the x-axis and expression on the y-axis.
