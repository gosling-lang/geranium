A linear visualization consisting of two synchronized line charts demonstrates a brushing and linking technique using multivec data. The top chart spans the entire chromosome 1, with genome positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, where lines are shown in sky blue. An interactive brush, displayed in steel blue, links to the bottom chart. The bottom chart, titled "Example: Brushing and Linking," focuses on a selected interval from 200,000,000 to 220,000,000 on chromosome 1. The expression values are consistently shown in sky blue lines. The data highlights interactions between genomic coordinates with a unified color theme across views.
