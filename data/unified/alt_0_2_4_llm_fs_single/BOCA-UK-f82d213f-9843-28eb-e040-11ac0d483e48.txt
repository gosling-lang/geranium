A circular and linear view are arranged vertically, linked by a blue brush in the circular view. The circular view includes five tracks: an ideogram, text annotations, two range annotation tracks, and a connection track. The ideogram displays genomic intervals with a color-coded brush for interaction. Text annotations in black highlight specific genomic categories. Range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' show genomic ranges in blue and orange rectangles, respectively.

The connection track visualizes relationships between genomic positions with lines in various colors, categorizing by 'svclass' valuesâ€”such as 'Gain' and 'LOH'. The linear view visualizes chromosome 1, corresponding to the highlighted region in the circular view. It contains tracks for ideograms, gene and text annotations, a scatter plot, range annotations, and connections. A scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' uses multicolored points to indicate mutation types. Rectangular range annotations represent 'Insertion' and 'Deletion'. The 'Copy Number Variants' track uses bars for quantitative data, in gray tones.
