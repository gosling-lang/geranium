A circular and linear genomic visualization in a vertical layout presents comprehensive data on chromosome 1, hg19 assembly. The circular view includes ideogram, text annotations, and color-coded ranges for 'Gain' (sky blue) and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' (dark orange), with links representing various structural variations like translocations and duplications. The linear view mirrors this, featuring gene annotations, chromosomal mutations as point scatter plots, and additional range tracks for CNVs. Interactive elements, such as a linking brush, enhance exploration across views.
