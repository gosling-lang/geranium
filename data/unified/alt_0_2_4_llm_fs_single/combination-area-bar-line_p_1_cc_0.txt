A stacked visualization in a linear layout depicting genomic data across chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top chart features an area plot divided into four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', with blue, orange, green, and red coloring respectively. The middle section displays a bar chart with the same categories, representing quantitative 'peak' values. The bottom section overlays a line chart and a scatterplot, where points vary in size based on 'peak' values. The categories are differentiated by color, consistent across all charts. A legend is included for category identification.
