A circular bar chart visualizes a vector dataset from a URL, representing genomic data laid out in a complete circle. The bars are colored in a muted silver hue. The x-axis displays the genomic position, while the y-axis quantifies the peak values of the dataset. The chart is static with a spacing of 1 and centered with a radius of 0.3, focusing the visual on the bar heights that indicate expression levels. The layout aligns in a stack format with each bar corresponding to different genomic positions across the entire genome assembly hg38.
