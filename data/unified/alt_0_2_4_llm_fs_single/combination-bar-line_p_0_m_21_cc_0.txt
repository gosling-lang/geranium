A linear visualization displays genomic data from chromosome 1 between base pairs 1 and 3,000,500. The upper track features a scatter plot with points representing quantitative 'peak' values on the y-axis. Each point's color signifies one of four samples: 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' The lower track is an overlay of a line and scatter plot, stratified by sample. Lines show the 'peak' values across positions, while point size indicates 'peak' magnitude. Colors differentiate the samples, using blue, orange, green, and red. The layout is set vertically, and tooltips provide genomic start, end, and peak data, enhancing interaction.
