This visualization presents two genomic regions on chromosomes 12 and 8, depicted in a linear layout with responsive design. The layout is structured into eight charts: two genomic range annotation tracks and six bar charts. The genomic range annotation tracks display gene annotations using purple and sky blue for strands, with elements like right/left triangles, text, rectangles, and lines representing various gene features. The bar charts illustrate expression levels across three samples, shown on the y-axis as bars colored in sky blue, purple, green, and pink. These tracks emphasize the quantitative "peak" value from vector data, linked by genomic position. The alignment and color variation effectively highlight differences in genomic data across these samples.
