A linear layout visualization displays genomic data of chromosome 1 from the hg38 assembly. It consists of five tracks: an ideogram, a gene annotation track, two copy number variant (CNV) tracks, and a rearrangement track.

- **Ideogram**: Shows chromosomal bands with regions colored based on cytoband stain. It includes triangular markers indicating the q and p arms of the chromosome.
  
- **Gene Annotation Track**: Displays gene locations with directional triangles for positive and negative strands. It is stratified by strand, with colors indicating strand direction.
  
- **CNV Tracks**: 
  - The first CNV track shows regions with a minor copy number of zero in tumor cells, colored purple.
  - The second CNV track shows amplified regions in tumor cells (total copy number > 4.5), colored pink.
  
- **Rearrangement Track**: Visualizes structural variations like duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions. Bands between regions are colored and stroked according to the rearrangement type.

The visualization permits comparison of genomic features across multiple data types for chromosome 1, facilitating the identification of complex structural variations and genomic alterations in a cancer dataset.
