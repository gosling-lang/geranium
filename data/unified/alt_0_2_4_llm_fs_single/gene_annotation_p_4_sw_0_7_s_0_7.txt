The visualization displays genomic data on chromosome 3 from positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000 using linear layouts. There are two main vertical arrangements of horizontal tracks, each containing three overlay views.

**First Arrangement:**
1. **HiGlass Track**: Displays genomic annotations with arrows indicating gene directions, colored in shades of blue and red based on strand orientation. Exons are highlighted with rectangles.
2. **Corces et al. Track**: Similar structure to HiGlass, showing annotations with text labels for gene names and rectangles for exons. Features two distinct color schemes for different strands.
3. **IGV Track**: Exhibits text and arrow annotations for genes with color variations depending on the strand, overlaid with white triangular patterns indicating the direction.

**Second Arrangement:**
1. **Cyverse-QUBES Track**: Shows gene names and directions using text and triangle markers. Exons are presented with light gray rectangles, and strand directions are depicted with gray arrows.
2. **GmGDV Track**: Features text annotations for genes with triangles indicating direction, and exons marked by rectangles. Uses a blue and red color scheme based on strand orientation.
3. **Additional Track**: Illustrates genomic regions using rectangles for genes, exons, and introns, with varying colors to differentiate these elements.

The visualization employs different colors and annotations to distinguish between positive and negative strands and provides detailed genomic annotation tracks for analytical comparison.
