The visualization presents a multivec dataset in a linear layout. It consists of two main tracks focusing on the chromosome 1 region from 1 to 3,000,500. The first track is a stacked bar chart that highlights expression values for four samples, represented in distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The bars' heights reflect the quantitative data of peaks. The second track overlays an area chart and a point chart, stratified by sample categories. Each sample is displayed in a row, with colors corresponding to the same palette used in the bar chart. The size of points in the scatter plot is proportionate to expression values. Tooltips provide detailed genomic positions and peak values when hovering over elements.
