The visualization comprises two linear tracks, arranged vertically, depicting genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The top track is a bar chart with bars stacked representing peak values for four samples in various colors. The x-axis shows the genomic position, and the y-axis displays quantitative values. In contrast, the bottom track is a stratified scatter plot with points representing the same samples. The rows are segregated by sample categories, with point colors matching the samples. Tooltips provide detailed information, such as start and end positions, peak values, and sample categories. The layout is designed to facilitate multivariable comparisons across the genomic regions.
