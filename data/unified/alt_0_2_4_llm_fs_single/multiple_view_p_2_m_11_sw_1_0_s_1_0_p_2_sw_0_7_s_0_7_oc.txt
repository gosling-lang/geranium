The visualization titled "Visual Linking" includes a combination of circular and linear layouts arranged vertically. The circular layout shows a line chart representing genomic data for chromosome 1 with interactive linking to a detailed linear view below. The line chart is stratified by categories, characterized by varying colors: orange, green, blue, and purple.

The linear view consists of an area chart displaying the same data categories as filled regions, also linked interactively to the detailed view below. The detailed scatter plot at the bottom allows users to explore a specified interval of chromosome 1, from 160,000,000 to 200,000,000. This plot highlights specific data points within these genomic regions, using colors to differentiate between categories. The visualization emphasizes interactivity through the use of linked brushing, enabling users to manipulate and update views dynamically.
