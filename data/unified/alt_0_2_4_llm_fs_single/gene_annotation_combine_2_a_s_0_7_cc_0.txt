The visualization consists of two genomic range annotation tracks laid out horizontally, each with a vertical arrangement of elements. It displays data for chromosome 3, spanning the interval from 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. The left track, titled "Corces et al.", features genes and their exons, represented by text, rectangles, and lines. The right track, titled "GmGDV", similarly shows genes and exons, using triangles for gene directionality. Both tracks stratify data by strand orientation with colors encoding positive and negative strands.
