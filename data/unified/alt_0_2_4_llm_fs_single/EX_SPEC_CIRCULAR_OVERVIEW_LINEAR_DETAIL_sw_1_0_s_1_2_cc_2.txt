The visualization is composed of a circular overview and two horizontal bar charts. The circular view displays genomic data using multivec format, with categories stratified into four samples. Each sample is represented by a bar of varying color around the circle, with colors including blue, orange, green, and red. The y-axis encodes quantitative data, showing expression levels. Connections between bars indicate genomic links, with the connections displayed in light purple.

Below the circular view are two horizontal bar charts representing specific chromosome regions (chr5 and chr16), synchronized with the circular overview using interactive brushes. These charts also display categories by samples with consistent color-coding. The background of these charts is lightly shaded in blue and red respectively, highlighting different genomic regions.

Overall, this visualization provides a comprehensive genomic data comparison across different categories and genomic positions.
