A linear layout visualizes sequence alignment using a BAM file, focusing on chromosome 1 from positions 136,750 to 139,450. The top track is a bar chart displaying coverage data with bars in a silver color, representing the number of reads aligned in specific regions. The bottom track is a pileup chart with rectangles color-coded to represent different types of structural variations, including 'normal read', 'deletion (+-)', 'inversion (++)', 'inversion (--)', 'duplication (-+)', 'more than two mates', 'mates not found within chromosome', and 'clipping.' The title is 'Pileup Track Using BAM Data'.
