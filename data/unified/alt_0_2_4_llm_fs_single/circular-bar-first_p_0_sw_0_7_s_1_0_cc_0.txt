A circular bar chart displays genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning the interval from 1 to 3,000,500. The chart is arranged vertically with a central radius of 0.5. It features four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each represented by distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. Bars illustrate expression values (peak) on the y-axis. The visualization includes genomic position and peak values as tooltips for interactivity, and a legend that denotes sample categorizations.
