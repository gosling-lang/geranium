A horizontal bar chart in a linear layout visualizes insertions and deletions from a VCF file. The genome is shown on the x-axis with annotations for chromosomes 2, 4, 6, 10, 16, and 22. The chart is separated into two rows, representing 'Insertion' and 'Deletion.' Rectangles within each row are colored orange for insertions and green for deletions. The layout includes text annotations for clarity. The color and stroke of rectangles distinguish between the two mutation types. The subtitle for the chart is 'Insertions and deletions from a VCF file.'
