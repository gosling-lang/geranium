The visualization consists of two circular charts arranged horizontally, focusing on chromosome 1. The left chart displays genomic connections using curved links between intervals (103,900,000 to 104,100,000) on the x-axis. The links are color-coded according to categorical values and have a semi-transparent appearance for visual distinction. The right chart showcases a stratified area plot representing expression data. This area plot maps samples as rows, each colored differently, displaying quantitative peaks on the y-axis against genomic positions on the x-axis. The combined charts provide a comprehensive view of genomic interactions and sample-specific expression levels, enhanced by tooltip functionality for detailed data inspection.
