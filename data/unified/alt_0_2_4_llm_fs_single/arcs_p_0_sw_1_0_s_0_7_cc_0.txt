The linear chart, titled "Visual Encoding" with the subtitle "Arcs," represents genomic data along the x-axis, depicting chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The visualization includes arcs connecting different regions within the specified genomic interval, with these connections color-coded based on the starting genomic position (s1). The arcs are rendered with a stroke color of black and have a stroke width of 0.5 and opacity of 0.2, providing a translucent effect. The visualization focuses on the interval between 103,900,000 and 104,100,000 on chromosome 1, highlighting structural connections within this range. Each arc is categorized using a nominal field, represented in colors such as blue, orange, green, and more, to indicate different data categories. The chart's linear layout is in a vertical arrangement with a center radius of 0.8, providing a clear view of genetic linkages within the specified genomic region.
