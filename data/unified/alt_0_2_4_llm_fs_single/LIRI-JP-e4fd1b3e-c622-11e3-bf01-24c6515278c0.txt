This visualization includes a circular and linear view of the genome data from assembly hg19, focusing on a representation of chromosome 1. The circular view offers an ideogram, a driver annotation track, two genomic range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' (blue) and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' (orange), and a within-link track showing structural variations. Different tracks use color and width encodings to represent data fields like 'svclass.' The linear view shows gene annotations, point mutations as a scatter plot, indel tracks depicting insertions and deletions, and additional range annotations. An interactive link is established between views via a blue brush on the ideogram, enhancing exploration of genomic regions.
