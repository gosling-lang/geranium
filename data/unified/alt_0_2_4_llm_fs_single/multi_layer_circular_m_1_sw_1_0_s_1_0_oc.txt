A circular line chart represents multiple time series data visualizing a multivec file. Displaying chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000, it uses a circular layout. Each line corresponds to a different sample, displaying genomic positions on the circular x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. The data is segmented into categories, shown by distinct line colors. Multiple tracks visualize quantitative data fields named 'peak,' with opacity varying across different value ranges. Data from categories like 'sample 1' through 'sample 16' are depicted, excluding 'sample -'. The visualization references Javed et al.'s study on graphical perception of multiple time series.
