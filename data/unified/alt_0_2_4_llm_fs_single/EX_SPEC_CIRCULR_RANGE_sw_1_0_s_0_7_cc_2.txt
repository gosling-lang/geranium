The visualization is a circular bar chart that displays genomic data from the entire genome of hg38. The positions are arranged around the circle, forming the x-axis. The height of each bar on the y-axis represents quantitative values from the data field named 'peak'. The bars are colored in light purple and form a complete 360-degree circular representation. The layout is static, with spacing set to 1, and the chart is centered with a radius of 0.3. The data is sourced from a vector file via a specified URL. The overall diameter of the visualization is approximately 490 units.
