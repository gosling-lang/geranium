The visualization is a linear ideogram track titled "Basic Marks: Rect," which represents the genomic intervals of chromosome 1 from the hg38 assembly. Colored rectangles indicate different stain types along the chromosome, with colors ranging from white to shades of gray, black, and blue, corresponding to categories like "gneg," "gpos25," "gpos50," "gpos75," "gpos100," and "gvar." The x-axis shows genomic positions with a size-stroke of 20 and a gray outline at 0.5 stroke width, providing a clear representation of the genomic structure. The subtitle "Tutorial Examples" signifies its educational purpose.
