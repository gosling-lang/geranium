The visualization consists of a multi-track alignment chart displayed in a vertical linear layout. It includes two views: one with a detailed zoomed-in view from position 350 to 396, and a compact overview covering the entire domain range of 0 to 396. The tracks in the zoomed view feature a 'Gap' analysis using purple bars and a 'Conservation' track using color-encoded quantitative bars with a hot color scheme. Additionally, the sequence alignment is represented with colorful rectangles and text, stratified by category names on nominal rows. The overview shows the full sequence alignment as colorful rectangles, overlaid with conservation and gap tracks, which are visually linked by an interactive brush for navigating between views. The visualization uses data from CSV files and the color palette for categories is rich and varied.
