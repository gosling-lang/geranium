A circular chart in a vertical arrangement visualizes genomic connections within chromosome 1. The layout is static, with a central radius of 0.5. Color-coded connections are illustrated across intervals 103,900,000 to 104,100,000, with a support for nine categories. The connections are displayed with varying colors including blue, orange, green, and red, indicating different categories. An opacity of 0.2 with black strokes and a width of 0.5 enhance the visual representation of genomic range links between intervals, focusing on particular segments of the chromosome.
