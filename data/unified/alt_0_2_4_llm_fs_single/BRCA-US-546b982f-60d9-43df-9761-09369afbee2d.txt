A dual-view genomic visualization combines circular and linear layouts using hg19 assembly data. The circular view displays the entire genome with an ideogram and multiple tracks indicating putative drivers, gains, losses, and structural variations. Interactive brushing links chromosome 1 in both views, with distinct colors representing categories like 'Gain' and 'LOH.' The linear view expands on this with tracks including ideograms, point mutations, and range annotations for genomic features like insertions, deletions, and copy number variations. Lines and connections illustrate structural variants, categorized by color, such as 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.'
