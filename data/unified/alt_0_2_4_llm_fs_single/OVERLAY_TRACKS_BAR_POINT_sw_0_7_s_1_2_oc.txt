The visualization titled "Example: Overlay Tracks" displays genomic data from chromosome 3 using a linear layout. It features an overlay of bars and points, each representing data from a BED database with significance values. The bars are stroked to indicate significance categories such as "Pathogenic," "Likely pathogenic," "Benign," etc., using colors like orange for pathogenic and green for benign. The x-axis shows genomic positions while the y-axis organizes by significance category, maintaining a baseline for "Uncertain_significance." This chart effectively demonstrates category differentiation through color-coding and point sizes, enhancing interpretability of genomic significance data.
