The visualization titled "Example: Overlayed Tracks" is a linear layout chart that overlays line and scatter plots. It represents genomic data from chromosome 1, covering a region from position 1 to 3,000,500. Data is sourced from a multivec file containing four categories labeled 'sample 1' to 'sample 4.' Each row in the chart corresponds to a category, with its color used to distinguish it. The x-axis represents the genomic position, while the y-axis shows quantitative data labeled 'peak' through both lines and points. Point sizes vary based on data magnitude, providing an additional dimension of insight. The chart's width is set to 700 pixels, with a height of 230 pixels, formatted using the hg38 genome assembly.
