A linear area chart visualizes a multivec file, showing the entire genome of hg38. The area is filled in light purple, representing the expression values using the data field named 'peak.' The x-axis displays genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative values. The title is 'Basic Marks: area' and the subtitle is 'Tutorial Examples.'
