The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view, linked by an interactive brush. The circular view displays the entire genome with five tracks: an ideogram, a point annotation track labeled 'Putative Driver', and two genomic range tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)', each with colored rectangles indicating variations. The circular chart includes additional tracks showing connections between genomic positions, colored based on categories like 'Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion'.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and features multiple tracks, including an ideogram with triangles for centromere regions, a 'Putative Driver' text annotation, and various genomic range annotations. Tracks include a scatter plot labeled 'Point Mutation', where points represent distances to previous mutations colored by mutation subtype. Other tracks show 'Copy Number Variants', and mutations classified as 'Insertion' or 'Deletion', with bars colored accordingly. The visualization offers a comprehensive view of genomic data, integrating structural variations into a cohesive layout.
