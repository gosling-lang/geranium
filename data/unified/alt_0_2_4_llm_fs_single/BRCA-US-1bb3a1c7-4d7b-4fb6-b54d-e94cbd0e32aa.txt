The visualization consists of a circular view and a linear view, arranged vertically. The circular view includes a genomic ideogram with a blue brush that links to the linear view below. This circular representation covers the entire human genome with five tracks: an ideogram, a text annotation track titled "Putative Driver," two range annotation tracks for genomic gains (blue) and losses of heterozygosity (LOH, orange), and a line-connection track indicating various structural variations.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and mirrors the features in the circular view with added detail. It includes a gene annotation track showing gene locations with text labels, a point mutation track showing distances between mutations, color-coded by mutation subtype, and more detailed tracks for insertions and deletions. Additionally, this view presents a copy number variants (CNV) track with a right-axis scale for quantitative measurement.

Both views facilitate interactive exploration, allowing users to analyze detailed genomic structures and variations such as translocations, duplications, deletions, and inversions, with connections marked by varying colors and styles.
