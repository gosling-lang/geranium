The visualization depicts a circular and linear genomic view, using the hg19 assembly. A circular ideogram is shown with interactive features controlled by a brush. The charts include "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" tracks visualizing genomic gains in blue and LOH in orange rectangles, as well as a "Putative Driver" text track, indicating annotated genomic features. Connections between genomic positions are represented with lines in various colors, denoting structural variants: 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' 'Inversion (TtT),' and 'Inversion (HtH)'. The linear arrangement has tracks similar to the circular view, but additionally includes a "Point Mutation" scatter plot and "Copy Number Variants" track, showing detailed data on single nucleotide variants and copy number alterations, depicted with varying rectilinear visualization based on data values.
