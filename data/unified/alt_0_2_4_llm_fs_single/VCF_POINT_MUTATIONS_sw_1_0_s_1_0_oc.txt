The visualization is a linear scatter plot representing point mutations extracted from a VCF file. It is arranged vertically and shows genomic positions on the x-axis from multiple chromosomes. The y-axis reflects the logarithmic values of the previous mutation distances, marked as points. Each point is color-coded by subtype, including categories such as 'C>A', 'C>G', 'C>T', 'T>A', 'T>C', and 'T>G', shown in a legend. The overall layout is specified to provide a centered view with a title "Point mutations from a VCF file." The data is sourced from a VCF file, highlighting mutation variations across the genome. The plot features an opacity setting of 0.9 for points, providing clear visibility against a linear backdrop.
