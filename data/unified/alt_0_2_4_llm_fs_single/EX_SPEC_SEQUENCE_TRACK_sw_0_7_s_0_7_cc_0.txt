The visualization displays a linear sequence bar chart with genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 3,000,000 to 3,000,010. Each bar represents nucleotide counts (A, T, G, C) color-coded as blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The height of the bars reflects the quantitative count, and nucleotide letters are overlaid in white text. Data is derived from a multivec file, with categories defining the nucleotide types. The layout is horizontally oriented, emphasizing the alignment of genomic positions.
