A circular genome visualization consists of two tracks. The left track is a circular chart displaying connections, with genomic intervals shown on the x-axis. The connections are represented in various colors to indicate different categories. The right track features a circular chart with an area plot, displaying genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. It is stratified by rows for the categories, which are represented in different colors. The visualization uses data from chromosome 1, covering intervals 1 to 3,000,500, and includes samples labeled "sample 1" to "sample 4."
