The visualization is a circular heatmap titled "Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts" with the subtitle "Heatmap." It represents genomic data on chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The layout uses a circular arrangement with a vertical configuration, featuring a central radius of 0.5. Static in nature, the heatmap encodes expression values as color intensity, stratified by rows representing four different samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each segment's color intensity corresponds to the quantitative field 'peak', allowing for the visual interpretation of data variation along the chromosome. An interactive legend is provided to associate color with expression values, enhancing data comprehensibility.
