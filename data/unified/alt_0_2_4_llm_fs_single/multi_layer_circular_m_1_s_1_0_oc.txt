A circular line chart visualizes a multivec file on chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The layout is circular, stratified into rows representing individual samples. Each sample is depicted with distinct colored lines indicating expression levels in these genomic intervals. The data is filtered to exclude 'sample -', showcasing curated categories. The chart effectively conveys quantitative changes in expression without explicit labeled axes, focusing on visual distinction between categories through the use of color.
