A linear visualization displays four tracks of BED files, all aligned under the title "BED files" with the subtitle "Demonstration of using BED files of different specifications." Each track covers chromosome 1 from position 1 to 2,000,000. The first track shows BED12 files with all 12 standard fields, while the second illustrates BED6 files with the first six fields. The third track demonstrates BED6+6 files, containing both standard and custom fields, and the fourth track, BED12+1, includes all standard fields plus a single extra custom field. Each track uses rectangles to represent genomic intervals, maintaining consistent sizing and a black stroke for distinction. The visualization effectively demonstrates the use of different BED file formats in genomic data representation.
