The visualization consists of two stacked linear charts displaying genomic data for chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a multi-row scatter plot displaying expression values for samples 1 to 4, stratified by rows. Points are sized and colored according to the 'peak' values, with distinct colors for each sample: blue, orange, green, and red. The bottom track is an overlay of line and scatter plots, also stratified by sample rows. Lines represent genomic intervals, while points indicate specific peak values, also sized and colored distinctly. Both tracks include interactive tooltips providing genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample identifiers. The visualization uses an opacity level of 0.5 for better visual clarity.
