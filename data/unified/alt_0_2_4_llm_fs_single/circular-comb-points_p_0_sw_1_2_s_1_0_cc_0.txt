A circular visualization with two juxtaposed views analyzes a multivec file displaying information for chromosome 1, from position 1 to 3,000,500. Each view is represented as a scatter plot within a circular layout, stratified by the categories 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4.' Each point's position and size depict genomic data encoded with the field 'peak.' The first view arranges points by categories in separate vertical rows. The second view presents them in a single view with gridlines, enhancing comparison of data across categories. Different samples are color-coded as blue, orange, green, and red within both views, adding clarity to data interpretation. The chart includes interactive tooltips providing genomic position and expression values for each point, facilitating detailed examination of the dataset. The visualization is static, maintaining a consistent view of the genomic intervals.
