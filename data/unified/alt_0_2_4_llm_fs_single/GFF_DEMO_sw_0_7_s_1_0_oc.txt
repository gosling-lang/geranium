A linear visualization of the E. coli genome using GFF3 data highlights gene regions from positions 222,000 to 240,000 on chromosome U00096.3. Gene types are color-coded: orange for protein-coding genes, blue for tRNA, green for rRNA, red for ncRNA, purple for pseudogenes, and black for unknown types. Triangular markers indicate gene orientation; rightward triangles for the "+" strand and leftward for the "-" strand. Gene names are displayed above their corresponding genomic intervals, aligned with dynamic line patterns that show their genomic span. The title is "GFF3 file" with the subtitle "E. coli genome, colored by gene type."
