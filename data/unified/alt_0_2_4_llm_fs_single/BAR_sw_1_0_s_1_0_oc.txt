The visualization is a linear bar chart titled "Basic Marks: bar," with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples." It uses a multivec file to display genomic data from the hg38 assembly. The x-axis represents genomic intervals, spanning multiple chromosomes (chr1 through chrY), while the y-axis shows quantitative expression values. The bars encode the 'peak' data field, aggregated over a bin size of 5. Each bar is uniformly sized and displayed in orange. The layout and configuration highlight genomic data across a broad range, providing a clear visual representation of expression variation along the genome.
