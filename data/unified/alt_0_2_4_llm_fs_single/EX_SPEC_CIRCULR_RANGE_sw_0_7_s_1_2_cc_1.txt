The visualization is a circular bar chart displaying genomic data from a vector file. It depicts the entire genome of the hg38 assembly, with chromosomes arranged around the circular axis. The x-axis represents the genomic position, while the y-axis displays quantitative peak values using bars. The bars are sky blue, contributing to the chart's visual coherence. This design leverages a static, circular layout with a focused center radius and stacked alignment. The visualization highlights expression levels across different genomic regions, providing a comprehensive overview of the data in a visually appealing format.
