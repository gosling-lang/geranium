A parallel layout visualization shows multiple genomic tracks of chromosomes 1 to 5 using multivec data. Each track consists of an area mark indicating expression peaks, colored by categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4' in distinct hues, and an ideogram representing cytogenetic bands. The expression values are plotted on the y-axis, with genomic positions on the x-axis. The ideograms include bands visualized with various shades of gray and black representing density, and colored triangles for centromeres in maroon. Each track is static and laid out horizontally, using data alignment and overlay techniques to integrate text labels indicating bands. The assembly used is hg38 with specific width and height adapted for each chromosome.
