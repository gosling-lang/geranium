The visualization comprises of two vertically arranged linear tracks depicting genomic data for chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a heat map representing expression values of four samples encoded via color intensity, with categories stratified by rows. The bottom track is a bar chart showing quantitative expression values on the y-axis across the x-axis genomic positions, with sample categories indicated by distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. Both tracks utilize a multivec file and offer detailed tooltip information for genomic positions, expression values, and sample categories. The assembly is hg38, and the layout is non-static, supporting dynamic interactions.
