The visualization consists of two linear tracks titled "New Approach: Stretching Tiles" and "Original Approach." Both tracks use a CSV file containing genomic data with fields such as "pos" for genomic positions. The tracks are overlayed with rectangles and text, where categories are represented by different colors. The x-axis shows genomic intervals from 350 to 396, while the y-axis is stratified by nominal categories. The experimental feature of "stretchGraphics" is applied to the "New Approach" track for smoother zooming, allowing scaling of elements instead of redrawing them. The entire figure has a unified title "Smoother Zoom," indicating the focus on transitioning graphics efficiently during zoom operations.
