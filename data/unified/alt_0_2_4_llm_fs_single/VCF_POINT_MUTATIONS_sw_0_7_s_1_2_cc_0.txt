A linear scatter plot displays point mutations from a VCF file in a vertical arrangement. The x-axis represents genomic positions across multiple chromosomes, while the y-axis shows the logarithmic distance to previous mutations (DISTPREVLOGE). Points are color-coded to indicate mutation subtypes, including C>A, C>G, C>T, T>A, T>C, and T>G. The visualization features a legend to clarify the color associations, and the opacity of the points is set to 0.9. The subtitle reads, "Point mutations from a VCF file."
