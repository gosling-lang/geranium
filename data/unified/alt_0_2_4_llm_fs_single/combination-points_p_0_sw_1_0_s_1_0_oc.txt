The visualization consists of two horizontal scatter plots in a linear layout, displaying a multivec file with genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top chart stratifies expression values by sample category across four rows, with each row represented by a different color: yellow for 'sample 1', green for 'sample 2', blue for 'sample 3', and pink for 'sample 4'. The size and vertical position of points reflect quantitative 'peak' values. The bottom chart overlays all samples in a single view, with similar encoding for color, size, and position. Both charts feature semi-transparent points (opacity 0.5), enhancing visual layering. The x-axis is labeled with genomic positions, while a grid enhances the quantitative comparison on the y-axis. The descriptive tooltip provides genomic start and end positions, peak value, and sample name for each data point.
