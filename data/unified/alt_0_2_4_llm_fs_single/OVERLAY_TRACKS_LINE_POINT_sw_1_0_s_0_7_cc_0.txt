**Description:**

This visualization titled "Example: Overlayed Tracks" is a line and scatter plot chart displayed in a linear layout. It uses a multivec data file to represent genomic data spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500 on chromosome 1. The x-axis represents genomic positions, and the y-axis represents quantitative expression values named 'peak'. Each row corresponds to a distinct sample category: "sample 1", "sample 2", "sample 3", and "sample 4". The lines and the variable-sized points are color-coded to differentiate these categories, using shades of blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The points vary in size based on the 'peak' value, enhancing the visualization of expression data fluctuations across genomic regions.
