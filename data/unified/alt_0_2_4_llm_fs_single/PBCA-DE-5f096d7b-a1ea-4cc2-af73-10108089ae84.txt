A circular and a linear view are arranged vertically, linked by an interactive brush in the circular view, highlighting genome regions. The circular view shows an ideogram and multiple genomic features including 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' tracks with blue and orange rectangles, respectively. A line-connection track illustrates structural variations with colored lines. Categories include 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' 'Inversion (TtT),' and 'Inversion (HtH).' The linear view displays detailed annotations for chromosome 1 with tracks for point mutations, displaying various 'SUBTYPE' categories, gene annotations, and genomic ranges for insertions and deletions. Copy Number Variants are also shown in gray rectangles. The layout is designed to provide an interactive genomic exploration experience with links between views.
