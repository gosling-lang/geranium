A linear visualization is split into two main charts, each demonstrating an alignment viewing technique for genomic data. The visualization is titled "Smoother Zoom," with a subtitle explaining the approach of scaling existing elements rather than redrawing them. The top chart, titled "New Approach: Stretching Tiles," utilizes the stretching graphics technique that offers smoother zoom transitions. Both charts show genomic intervals on the x-axis, stratified into rows representing different categories. Rectangles are color-coded to depict varying base values, with text annotations in black to represent base identities. The data is retrieved from a specified CSV file focused on the "p53" sequence alignment. This dual-view comparison highlights the visual and performance differences between the new and traditional rendering methods, with both charts featuring overlaying elements and genomic text labels indicating positional starts and ends.
