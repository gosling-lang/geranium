A circular Circos plot visualizes genomic data across the entire human genome, based on the hg38 assembly. The outer layer is a bar chart displaying peaks in purple, indicating quantitative genomic expression. An inner ideogram track displays chromosomal regions with color-coded categories representing different stain types, such as gneg, gpos, and acen. The innermost layer is composed of connections that link genomic positions across different chromosomes, encoded with varying colors to reflect distinct chromosomal categories. The overall layout is static and arranged in a stacked format, emphasizing genomic relations and variations.
