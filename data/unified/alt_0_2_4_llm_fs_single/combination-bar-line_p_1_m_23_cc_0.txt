The visualization consists of two tracks in a linear vertical arrangement, displaying data related to chromosome 1 within the range of positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top track features a bar and scatter plot, representing data across four samples: 'sample 1' through 'sample 4'. Each bar and point color indicates different samples with specific nominal categories: blue for 'sample 1', orange for 'sample 2', green for 'sample 3', and red for 'sample 4'. The position values are mapped to the x-axis, while the peak values are shown on the y-axis. The height of the points reflects the peak values. This chart stratifies data by sample on separate rows and marks bars for general trends with overlaid points. The lower track only displays data in bars, encoding peak values along the y-axis. The visualization uses multivec data type and includes genomic details in the tooltip for enhanced interactivity, providing a comprehensive look at quantitative expression variation across samples.
