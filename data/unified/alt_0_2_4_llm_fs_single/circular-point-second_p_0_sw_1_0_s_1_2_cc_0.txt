A circular scatter plot visualizes a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500 using the hg38 assembly. Data points represent genomic positions encoded with the 'peak' field, indicating both position and size with quantitative attributes. The color scheme differentiates among four samples: 'sample 1' (blue), 'sample 2' (orange), 'sample 3' (green), and 'sample 4' (red). The opacity of the points is set to 0.5, allowing overlap visibility. Tooltip attributes include start and end genomic positions, peak values, and sample names, enhancing interactive exploration. The circular layout and vertical arrangement provide a compact, comprehensive view of genomic expression data within the specified interval.
