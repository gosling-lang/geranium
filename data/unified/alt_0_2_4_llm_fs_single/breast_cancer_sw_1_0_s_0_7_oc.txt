A multi-track linear visualization depicts genomic features over chromosome 1. The first track is an ideogram with cytobands, using color to distinguish regions such as gneg, gpos, gvar, and acen. The second track annotates gene positions with strand-oriented triangles in blue and brown. Two tracks represent copy number variations in tumor data: one highlights regions with a minor copy number of zero using dark orange rectangles, and another focuses on total copy numbers with green rectangles. The final track illustrates structural variants with curved connections, showing tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions in distinct colors.
