**Description**: 

This visualization demonstrates a linear ideogram of the hg38 genome with semantic zooming functionality. The title "Example: Semantic Zooming," accompanied by the subtitle "Text and triangle marks will show when zooming in to provide more details," indicates that additional genomic annotations appear upon zooming. The ideogram is rendered on a single linear track. Rectangles represent different chromosome regions differentiated by stain categories, such as "gneg," "gpos25," and others, each color-coded from white to dark shades of gray. When zooming in, text annotations for chromosome names and colored triangles appear, indicating specific genomic boundaries. Different stains alter rectangle colors between white, gray shades, and specific categorical colors, enhancing visual distinction. This track portrays the entire genome with chr1 to chrY, offering a detailed portrayal of genomic data in intervals along the x-axis.
