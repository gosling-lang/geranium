A bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, representing genomic data from the entire genome of hg38. The x-axis shows genomic intervals, while the y-axis displays quantitative expression levels using pink bars. The visualization is titled 'Basic Marks: bar' with the subtitle 'Tutorial Examples'. The bars have a fixed size, providing a clear representation of expression peaks across different genomic positions.
