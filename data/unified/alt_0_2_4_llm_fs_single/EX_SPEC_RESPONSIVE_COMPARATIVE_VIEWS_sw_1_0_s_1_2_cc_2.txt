A horizontal arrangement of three linear bar charts visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome intervals for chromosomes 9 and 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. Each bar chart represents the genomic position on the x-axis and quantitative data on the y-axis. The left track displays data in pink bars, the middle track in green, and the right track in purple. The data is aggregated from categorized samples, using a bin size of 8, and includes specific styling features like a white stroke and 0.5 stroke width. The assembly version is hg38, and the layout adjusts responsively based on width parameters, utilizing JSON specifications for dynamic rendering.
