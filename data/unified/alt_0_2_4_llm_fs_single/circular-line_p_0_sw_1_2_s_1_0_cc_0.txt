A circular visualization displays a multivec file, mapping chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. Four samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4') are represented in rows, differentiated by distinct colors. The chart combines line and scatter plots to illustrate 'peak' values, with line color and point size corresponding to data categories. The configuration is static with a top-axis genomic scale. The chart's design employs color codes: blue, orange, green, and red, for each sample, respectively.

The processed specification verifies the circular arrangement and federal genomic axis, illustrating the relationships in a multivec data context. The arrangement emphasizes patterns across samples visually by utilizing size and color variations in a circular dimension, enabling easy comparison and trend identification among samples within specified genomic positions.
