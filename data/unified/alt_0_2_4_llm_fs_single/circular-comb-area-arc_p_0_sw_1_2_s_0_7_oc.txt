The visualization is a circular layout consisting of two tracks. On the left, an area chart displays genomic position data along the x-axis and quantitative peak values along the y-axis. This track is stratified by rows, representing four samples, each colored differently for distinction. On the right, a within-link chart illustrates genomic connections, highlighting a specific interval on chromosome 1 from 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. The connections are color-coded based on categories and feature a soft opacity with a black stroke outlining them. The chart uses data from multivec and CSV sources, presenting a dynamic view of genomic variation in a structured circular format.
