A circular line chart in a circular layout visualizes a multivec file, displaying chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. Multiple lines are drawn in concentric rows, each representing different samples such as 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', etc. Each sample is depicted in a distinct color, including blue, orange, green, red, and purple. The visualization maps genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis. The design is arranged to showcase data across categories and is set within a 1600x1600 dimension.
