This visualization shows a stratified bar chart within a linear layout, displaying multivec data on chromosome 12 between base pairs 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart uses multiple time series data with categories named 'sample 1' to 'sample 16,' excluding 'sample -'. Each sample is depicted with distinct colors. The height and opacity of the bars represent the quantitative field 'peak,' with responsive sizing adjusting the display based on the chart's height. This representation references graphical perception studies, specifically Javed et al.'s work on multiple time series (TVCG 2010).
