A linear visualization of genomic data from chromosome 1 spans positions 1 to 3,000,500. The chart consists of multiple rows, each representing a sample (sample 1 to sample 4). It combines line and scatter plot elements to encode expression values on the y-axis across these samples. The height of peaks is depicted using both line and scatter plot visual encodings, with point sizes indicating quantitative peak values. Rows are distinctly colored to represent different samples, and a legend provides category labels. Tooltips offer additional details, including genomic position, peak value, and sample name.
