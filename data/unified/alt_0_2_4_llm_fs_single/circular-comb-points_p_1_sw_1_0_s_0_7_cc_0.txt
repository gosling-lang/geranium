A pair of circular scatter plots in a circular layout visualizes a multivec file for chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. The left plot shows expression values using points, with size and y-coordinates encoded by the 'peak' value. The right plot stratifies data by rows, based on 'sample' categories. Colors represent different samples: 'sample 1' (blue), 'sample 2' (orange), 'sample 3' (green), and 'sample 4' (red). Both plots include interactive tooltips providing genomic positions and peak values. The layout centers around the genomic axis, emphasizing the vertical arrangement of the views.
