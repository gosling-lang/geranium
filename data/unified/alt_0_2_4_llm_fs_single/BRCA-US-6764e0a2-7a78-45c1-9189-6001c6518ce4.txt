The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view arranged vertically, offering a comprehensive mapping of genomic data across the entire hg19 genome assembly. In the circular view, five distinct tracks depict various annotations: an ideogram, point annotations, range annotations for 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' and line connections based on structural variant classifications like 'Duplication,' 'Translocation,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.' Blue and orange rectangles indicate genomic regions with significant variations. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, corresponding to the highlighted portion in the circular view, and expands on these annotations with additional tracks, including a detailed gene annotation track, a point mutation scatter plot, and two range annotation tracks, one of which visualizes a CSV file depicting 'Copy Number Variants.' The point mutation scatter plot represents variants from a VCF file, marking distances to previous mutations with diverse colors signifying different mutation types, such as 'C>A' and 'C>T.' This dual representation allows for intricate exploration of genomic variations and structural changes across the specified chromosome.
