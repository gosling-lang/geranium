A circular bar chart visualizes genomic data in a stacked circular layout, centered at a radius of 0.3. This visualization uses a vector data type, displaying the genome on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis. The bars are colored in pink. The chart maintains a static structure with a width and height of 700, showcasing the entire genome in a radial manner. The bar heights reflect the value of the 'peak' field, highlighting genomic positions across all chromosomes.
