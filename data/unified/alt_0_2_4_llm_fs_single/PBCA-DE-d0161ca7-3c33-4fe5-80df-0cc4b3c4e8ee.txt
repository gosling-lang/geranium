The visualization features a circular and a linear view arranged vertically. The circular view represents the entire hg19 genome with interactive brushing for chromosome 1, which is detailed in the linear view below. The circular view includes an ideogram, a text track featuring "Putative Driver," two annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" with blue and orange rectangles, respectively, and a structural variant track displaying connections of varied colors for categories such as 'Translocation' and 'Duplication'.

The linear view breaks down chromosome 1, with an ideogram, text annotations, and genomic range annotations. It illustrates point mutations in a scatter plot colored by mutation subtype, and distinguishes insertions and deletions with separate tracks and colors. The "Copy Number Variants" track exhibits total variation through grayscale bars. Categories are consistently represented with distinct colors across views for easy interpretation.
