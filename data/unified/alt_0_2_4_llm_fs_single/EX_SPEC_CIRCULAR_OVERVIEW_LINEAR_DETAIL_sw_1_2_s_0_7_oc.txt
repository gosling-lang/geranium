A circular and linear visualization of genomic data is displayed with interactive links between sections. The circular chart features a multivec file with four samples represented in distinct colors over intervals. The categories, displayed as bars, can be brushed to connect views. The inner circular track shows genomic connections across several chromosomes, highlighting variations like deletions, inversions, translocations, and duplications, with strokes in diverse colors.

Below, two bar charts detail specific genomic regions, one focusing on chromosome 5 with a blue background and the other on chromosome 16 with a red background. Each chart is stratified by sample and shows expression data with bar heights. The layout connects seamlessly, allowing exploration of genome-wide and detailed chromosome-specific insights.
