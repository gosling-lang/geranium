The visualization presents an overlaid matrix diagram laid out horizontally, focusing on chromosome 10. It consists of two distinct tracks: one in grey and the other in pink. Each matrix showcases genomic intervals on both the x- and y-axes, with expression values encoded by color intensity. The grey matrix occupies the lower-left quadrant, displaying data in darker shades, while the pink matrix is in the upper-right quadrant, providing a contrast with lighter shades. This overlay effectively highlights genomic interactions, utilizing color gradients to denote quantitative differences. Responsive design adjusts matrix displays based on the presentation width.
