The visualization titled "Example: Semantic Zooming" demonstrates a linear ideogram layout, representing human chromosomes from mapping data in a CSV file. Chromosomes are visualized as horizontal gray and white bars across the x-axis, with additional black text annotations that display chromosome names, such as "chr1" and "chr2." The visualization includes a semantic zoom function that reveals text and triangle marks for more detail when zooming in. Different colors are used to distinguish varying chromosomal stains, including gray for acen regions and maroon for triangles. The chart has a width of 960 pixels, providing a comprehensive view of the entire chromosome range in the hg38 assembly. The description and titles are succinct, emphasizing semantic zooming features to enhance data exploration.
