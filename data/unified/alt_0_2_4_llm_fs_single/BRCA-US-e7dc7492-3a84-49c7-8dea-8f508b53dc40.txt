A visualization displayed in both circular and linear layouts, presenting genomic data from a CSV file regarding chromosome 1. The circular view showcases a series of interconnected tracks, including an ideogram, a point annotation track with black text, and two range annotation tracks. The first range track, titled "Gain," uses blue rectangles, while the second track, titled "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," employs orange rectangles. A line-connection track demonstrates various structural variations in different colors representing categories such as 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', 'Inversion (TtT)', and 'Inversion (HtH)'. In the linear view, supplementary tracks feature genomic annotations with rectangles and left/right triangles, a scatter plot called "Point Mutation", and a track titled "Copy Number Variants" visualizing quantitative data fields with light gray bars. The linked brush in the circular view allows interactive exploration of specific genome sections, making both views interdependent and interactive.
