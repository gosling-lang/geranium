**Description**: 
This visualization is a multi-row bar chart with a linear layout, encapsulating data from a multivec file. It depicts the genomic region spanning chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. Each row corresponds to one of four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Bars within each row encode quantitative data based on the 'peak' value, with their heights representing the expression levels. The rows are distinguished by colors — orange, green, blue, and pink — corresponding to each sample. The visualization also includes interactive tooltips that provide genomic start and end positions, sample names, and peak values upon hovering. This structured organization allows for comparative analysis of genomic expressions across samples within the specified chromosomal interval.
