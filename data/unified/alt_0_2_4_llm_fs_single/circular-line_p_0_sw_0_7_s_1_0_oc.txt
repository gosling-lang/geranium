A circular visualization displaying genomic data from chromosome 1 across samples. The visualization encodes data from a multivec file, showcasing expression values overlaid with lines and points. Data is stratified by rows for categories 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each represented by a distinct color. The position on the genome is shown on the x-axis, while expression values are represented on the y-axis. The chart includes tooltip interactions for detailed data inspection.
