A linear visualization consisting of five tracks displays genetic data related to chromosome 1. The top track is an ideogram with colored blocks indicating various cytogenetic bands, categorized by different color codes. Blue and orange triangles in the second track denote genomic positions of gene annotations, differentiated by strand direction. The third and fourth tracks utilize rectangles to represent copy number variations, with purple rectangles indicating minor copy number events and pink for higher total copy number in tumor samples. The final track connects genomic positions with curves, illustrating structural variations such as tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions. Each variation type is represented by specific line colors and strokes, facilitating differentiation.
