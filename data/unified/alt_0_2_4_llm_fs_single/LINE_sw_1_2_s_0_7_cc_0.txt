A line chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, depicting the entire genome of hg38. The position of lines is encoded using the data field named 'peak.' The color of the lines is pink, and the size is set to 2. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis displays quantitative expression values. The visualization is titled 'Basic Marks: line' with the subtitle 'Tutorial Examples.'
