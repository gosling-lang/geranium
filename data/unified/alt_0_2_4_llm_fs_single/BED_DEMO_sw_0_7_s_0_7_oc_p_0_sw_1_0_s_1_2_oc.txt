The visualization titled "BED files" uses a linear layout to demonstrate various BED file specifications over chromosome 1, spanning 1 to 2,000,000 base pairs. It includes four vertically arranged tracks:

1. "BED12: All 12 standard fields" displays genomic intervals with black outlines using BED12 files.
2. "BED6: A file with the first 6 BED fields," also shows genomic intervals with black outlines from BED6 files.
3. "BED6+6: A file with the first 6 BED fields, and 6 custom fields" visualizes intervals with black outlines using BED6+6 files, utilizing custom fields for chromosomal data.
4. "BED12+1: A file with all 12 standard fields, and a single extra custom field," uses BED12+1 files with an additional custom field, presenting intervals with black outlines.

All tracks feature rectangular marks, helping compare different BED file formats. The axes are labeled with genomic intervals, and the title includes a subtitle for context.
