A multi-sample line chart and scatter plot are presented in a linear layout, visualizing a multivec file across chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The chart comprises four rows, each representing a different sample, labeled 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' Lines and points depict genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative 'peak' values on the y-axis, respectively. Each sample is distinguished by unique colors and point sizes proportional to the 'peak' value. Tooltip functionality enhances interactivity by providing detailed information about genomic position, sample, and value.
