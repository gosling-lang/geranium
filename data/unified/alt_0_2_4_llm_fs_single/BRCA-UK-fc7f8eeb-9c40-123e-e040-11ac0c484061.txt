A visualization featuring a circular view and a linear view linked by a blue interactive brush. The circular view displays the complete genome, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. The circular section has five tracks: an ideogram, a point annotation track for putative drivers, two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" in blue and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in red, and a line-connection track illustrating structural variations. These variations, including categories like "Gain," "LOH," "Translocation," "Duplication," "Deletion," and "Inversion," are color-coded. The linear view expands this with additional tracks: a gene annotation layer, a scatterplot titled "Point Mutation" showing mutation distance in varied colors, and two further range tracks highlighting "Insertion" and "Deletion" events in yellow and green. "Copy Number Variants," another track, displays quantitative data in gray bars.
