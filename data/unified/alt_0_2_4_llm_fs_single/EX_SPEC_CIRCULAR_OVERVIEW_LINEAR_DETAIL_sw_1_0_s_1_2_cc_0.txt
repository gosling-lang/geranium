The visualization consists of a circular and linear view arranged vertically. The circular view showcases the entire genome using bar charts and genomic connections. It displays data from 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4' across different chromosomes with different colors such as blue, orange, green, and red. Genomic connections are highlighted with strokes indicating categories like deletion and inversion. The linear view, linked via interactive brushes, features separate bar charts for chromosome 5 and chromosome 16, stratified by sample categories with distinct backgrounds and linking IDs for interactive exploration.
