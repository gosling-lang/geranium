The visualization contains two views arranged vertically, each with multiple tracks. The first view includes three tracks:

1. **Gap Track**: A purple bar chart illustrates gap data over a genomic range from positions 350 to 396. The height of each bar corresponds to the gap values, represented on the y-axis.

2. **Conservation Track**: An orange bar chart shows conservation data over the same genomic range. The bars' heights and colors represent conservation values.

3. **Alignment Track**: This includes rectangles and text representing genomic base pairs for various sequences. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while rows indicate sequence identifiers, using unique colors for each base.

The second view is an overlay:

1. **Rectangles and Text**: Displays aligned genomic sequences with rows for different identifiers, color-coded by bases.

2. **Conservation Overlay**: A bar chart showcasing conservation data as in the first view.

3. **Gap Overlay**: A bar chart depicting gap data, similar to the first view, but with pink bars.

These views visualize genomic sequences, their gaps, and conservation metrics, enabling analysis of sequence alignment and variabilities among positions.
