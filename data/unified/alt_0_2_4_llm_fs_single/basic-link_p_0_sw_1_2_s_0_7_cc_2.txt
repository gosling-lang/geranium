A linear chart illustrates genomic links on chromosome 1 using a CSV file. The arcs represent connections between genomic positions defined by start and end points, `s1` to `e1` and `s2` to `e2`. The color of the arcs is light green. The title is "Basic Marks: Link," with a subtitle "Tutorial Examples." The visualization spans the whole chromosome 1, depicted from the start to the end of the specified genomic intervals.
