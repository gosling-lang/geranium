The visualization comprises three main tracks arranged vertically, each representing genomic data on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The first track displays an area chart stratified by four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is shown in a distinct color over a shared genomic x-axis, with the peak values plotted on the y-axis. The second track presents a combined line chart and scatter plot, with lines and size-encoded points illustrating the quantitative peaks for each sample. The third track features a bar chart displaying the same genomic range, with bar heights representing quantitative peaks and colors indicating different samples. Each track incorporates tooltips for detailed data exploration and maintains alignment through zoom capabilities within the defined genomic interval.
