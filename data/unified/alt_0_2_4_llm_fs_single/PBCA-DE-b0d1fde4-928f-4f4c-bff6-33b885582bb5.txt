The visualization consists of a circular view and a linear view, linked by an interactive brush. The circular view presents the complete genome as an ideogram with five tracks: an ideogram, point annotations, two range annotations, and a line-connection track. The point annotation track uses a CSV file and displays genetic data associated with putative drivers. The first range track shows "Gain" regions with blue rectangles, while the second shows "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in orange. The line-connection track highlights structural variations, color-coded based on categories like "Translocation" and "Duplication."

The linear view, corresponding to chromosome 1, mirrors the tracks of the circular view and includes detailed gene annotations, a scatter plot, and additional range tracks. The "Point Mutation" scatter plot visualizes genetic mutations from a VCF file, with points colored by mutation subtype. Additional tracks indicate insertions and deletions using rectangles in a genomic range annotation track, and copy number variations through a graph depicting quantitative measures. Each chart in the visualization is intricately color-coded, providing a comprehensive overview of genomic data and variations.
