The visualization is a combination of circular and linear views, linked by a blue interactive brush. The circular view displays the full genome, while the linear view highlights chromosome 1. In the circular view, there are five tracks: an ideogram, a text annotation track labeled "Putative Driver," two range annotation tracks named "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" represented by blue and orange rectangles, and a line-connection track that illustrates genomic connections categorized by structural variation (SV) types like Translocation and Duplication. 

The linear view provides more detailed visualization for chromosome 1, exhibiting nine tracks: an ideogram, a "Putative Driver" text track, a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" representing distance to previous mutations via point position and color-coded by mutation subtype, a gene annotation track, and multiple range annotation tracks for Insertions, Deletions, Copy Number Variants (CNVs), Gain, and LOH. These tracks utilize different markers like bars and triangles. Color and stroke in the line-connection track help categorize different SV types, including Translocation and Duplication. The color scheme and diverse chart types aid in distinguishing data categories and enhancing the interpretability of complex genomic information.
