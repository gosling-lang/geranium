The visualization comprises a circular view and a linear view, arranged vertically. The circular view displays the human genome assembly hg19 using an ideogram. It includes tracks for 'Putative Driver' genes as text annotations, 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' ranges in blue and orange rectangles respectively, and structural variations as link connections. The central brush allows for interaction with the linear view. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, detailing three main tracks: 'Putative Driver' text annotations, 'Point Mutation' scatter plot highlighting various mutation types, and a range showing copy number variations. Additionally, it displays 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' events with corresponding bars. The connections are categorized by structural variation classes, enriching the genomic data representation.
