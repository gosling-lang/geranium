A circular bar chart in a vertical arrangement visualizes genomic data from samples 1 and 2. The chart focuses on chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. The bars represent expression values with their height corresponding to the range between 'peak_min' and 'peak_max'. Each sample is displayed in distinct colors, blue and orange, to differentiate categories. The chart includes black outlines for the bars and a legend, enhancing visual clarity. The genomic intervals are marked on the top axis, providing a comprehensive genomic overview.
