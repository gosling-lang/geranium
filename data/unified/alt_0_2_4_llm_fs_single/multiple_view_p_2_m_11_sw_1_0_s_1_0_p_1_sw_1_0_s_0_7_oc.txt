The visualization titled "Visual Linking" features an interactive genomic data presentation. It consists of a scatter plot and two linked detail views: a linear area chart and a circular line chart. 

1. **Scatter Plot (Top View):** 
   - Displays genomic data across chromosome 1 between 160,000,000 and 200,000,000 units.
   - Points represent quantitative data ('peak') for four samples.
   - Categories are color-coded, with each point stratified by these categories.

2. **Linked Detail Views (Bottom Views):**
   - **Linear Area Chart:**
     - Shows full chromosome 1.
     - Area plots represent the same 'peak' data, color-coded by category.
     - Includes a brush tool enabling zoom and selection.

   - **Circular Line Chart:**
     - Represents chromosome 1 in a circular format.
     - Lines are drawn to indicate data trends for each sample.
     - Includes a brush tool for interactive linking with the linear chart.

These views allow for detailed exploration of genomic data, facilitating easy navigation and comparison between different data samples and categories.
