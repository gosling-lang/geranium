A circular genome visualization in a layered layout displays data across multiple chromosomes. The outermost layer is a band ideogram colored according to chromosome staining types, revealing patterns of structural variations. Two inner layers represent copy number variations (CNVs) in tumor samples, marked in purple for 'minor' variations and light blue for 'total' variations exceeding 4.5 copies. The innermost layer features interconnected lines indicating genomic rearrangements, such as tandem duplications and inversions, with distinct colors and stroke patterns for each rearrangement type. The chart uses data from CSV sources and applies filters to enhance the clarity of genomic variations.
