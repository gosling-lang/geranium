The visualization consists of two linked views: a circular view and a linear view, both representing genomic data from the hg19 assembly. The circular view includes an ideogram and several tracks: a text annotation track titled 'Putative Driver', two range annotation tracks for 'Gain' (sky blue) and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' (dark orange), and a line-connection track displaying structural variations such as 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', 'Inversion (TtT)', and 'Inversion (HtH)' in different colors.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, providing a detailed look with similar tracks as the circular view and additional ones. It includes a gene annotation track, a scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation', visualizing a VCF file with points colored by substitution types ('C>A', 'C>G', 'C>T', 'T>A', 'T>C', 'T>G'), and rectangles indicating 'Insertion' and 'Deletion'. The 'Copy Number Variants' track displays bars representing copy number data with light gray rectangles. This comprehensive genomic visualization, linked by a blue brush, provides insights into various genomic variations and structural changes.
