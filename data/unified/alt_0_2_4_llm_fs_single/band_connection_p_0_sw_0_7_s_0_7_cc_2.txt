A linear layout visualization of chromosomal data from hg38, focusing on chromosome 1 between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000, using CSV files. The tracks alternate between rectangles and connections. Rectangles visualize start and end genomic positions using a sky blue color with reduced opacity, allowing clearer visualization of overlapping regions. Connection tracks, utilizing red and purple links, represent associations between different genomic segments. Each track maintains a consistent width, and the transitions are marked with strokes and tooltips indicating start and end positions.
