The visualization depicts a circular bar chart in a stacked alignment showcasing genomic data. The entire genome is represented along the circular x-axis, with gene expression values illustrated as green bars radiating outward. The data source is a vector format accessed via a specified URL. The layout has a static, centered design with minimal spacing between elements, and it covers the genome assembly hg38. This visualization highlights the peaks of genomic expression, emphasizing quantitative values on the y-axis with a uniform green color scheme.
