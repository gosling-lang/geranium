This visualization, titled "Basic Marks: area," is a linear area chart displaying genomic data from the hg38 assembly. The x-axis represents the genomic positions across the entire genome, specifically from chromosome 1 to chromosome 22. The y-axis indicates quantitative peak values. The data, sourced from a multivec file, include a category "sample 1" and are encoded using an area mark, providing an overview of expression levels. The chart features a subtitle, "Tutorial Examples," and spans dimensions of 560 by 156 pixels. The spikes and valleys in the yellow area chart effectively portray variations in genomic expression.
