A linear ideogram visualization displays the genomic data for chromosome 1 from the hg38 assembly. It is titled "Basic Marks: Rect" with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples." The ideogram uses rectangular marks to represent different genomic regions, colored based on categorical stain values: "gneg," "gpos25," "gpos50," "gpos75," "gpos100," and "gvar." The colors range from white to shades of gray and black. The genomic positions are mapped along the x-axis, and the chart includes an axis at the top indicating varying chromosomal positions in numeric format (e.g., 50,000,000 to 200,000,000). The visualization has gray strokes around the rectangles and uses a white outline for better visibility.
