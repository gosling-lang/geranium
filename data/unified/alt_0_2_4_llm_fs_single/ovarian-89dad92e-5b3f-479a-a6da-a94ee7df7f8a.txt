The visualization consists of a circular view and a linear view stacked vertically, with an interactive connection via a blue brush in the circular view that links to the linear view. The circular layout presents the entire genome of hg19, featuring five tracks including an ideogram, a point annotation track labeled 'Putative Driver,' two genomic range tracks titled 'Gain' (with blue rectangles) and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' (with red rectangles), and a line-connection track that illustrates structural variants with different line colors. The categories represented include 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.'

Below, the linear view focuses on chromosome 1, mirroring the structure of the circular view with additional elements. It includes a gene annotation track, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' displaying VCF data with points colored according to mutation subtypes, and two further genomic range tracks for insertions and deletions, characterized by yellow and green rectangles respectively. Finally, another track titled 'Copy Number Variants' visualizes CSV data with grey rectangles indicating quantitative data.
