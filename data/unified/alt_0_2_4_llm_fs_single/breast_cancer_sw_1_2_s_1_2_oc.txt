The visualization consists of five tracks arranged in a linear layout, displaying data related to chromosome 1. The tracks include:

1. **Ideogram Track**: Displays chromosomal bands with color-coded categories, including white for "gneg" and black for "gpos100."

2. **Genomic Position Annotation Track**: Shows gene annotations with directional triangles based on the strand orientation. Blue and beige colors indicate positive and negative strands, respectively.

3. **Copy Number Variants (CNV) Track 1**: Visualizes tumor CNV data with red rectangles representing minor copy number alterations.

4. **CNV Track 2**: Shows CNV data with green rectangles indicating total copy numbers in the tumor.

5. **Structural Variations Track**: Displays genomic rearrangements as colored links connecting genomic positions. Categories include tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions, visualized in distinct colors like green and orange.

This visualization uses data from CSV and BEDDB files, providing insights into genomic structures and variations within chromosome 1.
