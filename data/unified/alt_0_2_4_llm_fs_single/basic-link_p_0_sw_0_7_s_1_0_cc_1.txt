The visualization is a linear layout featuring genomic connections, represented by arcs. The data is sourced from a CSV file that links genomic intervals on chromosome 1, displayed on the x-axis. The arcs are rendered in light purple, depicting links within the genomic regions. This chart, titled "Basic Marks: Link," is part of a tutorial in showcasing genomic connections. The visualization utilizes a multiscale layout, specifically oriented for interactivity, allowing users to explore connections between genomic intervals, represented by the start and end fields 's1', 'e1', 's2', and 'e2'.
