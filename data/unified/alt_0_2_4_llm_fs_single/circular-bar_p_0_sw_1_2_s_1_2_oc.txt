A circular bar chart with a vertical arrangement visualizes a multivec file for chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The chart displays intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, with each bar's height representing the min and max peak values. It is divided into two rows corresponding to 'sample 1' and 'sample 2,' each colored differently with a legend. The chart has black-stroked bars, and tooltips provide detailed genomic position and peak value information. The layout is static, with a centered radius to maintain circular uniformity.
