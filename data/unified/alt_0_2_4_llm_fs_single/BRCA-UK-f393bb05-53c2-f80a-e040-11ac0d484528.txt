The visualization consists of a circular view and a linear view, arranged vertically and linked by an interactive brush. The circular view displays the complete genome with a focus on chromosome 1. It includes tracks for an ideogram, point annotations, genomic range annotations, and connectivity lines. The circular ideogram shows genomic intervals, color-coded to distinguish categories. Annotations refer to genomic gains in blue and losses (LOH) in orange. Connectivity lines indicating structural variations are color-coded by type, such as translocations or duplications.

The linear view highlights chromosome 1 with multiple tracks: an ideogram, gene annotation, point mutations, and copy number variants (CNV). The point mutation track, titled "Point Mutation," visualizes VCF file data, with point positions representing mutation distances, color-coded by mutation subtype. The CNV track displays grayscale rectangles representing variations in copy number. Color-coded tracks illustrate gains (blue) and losses (orange), consistent with the circular tracks. This dual-view layout provides a comprehensive view of genomic structure and variations.
