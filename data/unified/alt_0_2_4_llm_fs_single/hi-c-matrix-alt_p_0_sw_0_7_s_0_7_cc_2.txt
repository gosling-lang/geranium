The visualization titled "Hi-C Matrix" with the subtitle "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations" displays genomic data from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 in a linear layout. It features an overlay of multiple tracks. The primary matrix track represents genomic intervals on both the x- and y-axes, using color intensity to encode expression values. Vertical and horizontal rules are overlaid, marked in green and sky blue, respectively, indicating specific genomic locations on the axes. Additional tracks include a bar chart displaying genomic intervals for chromosomes 6, 7, and 8, with their bars categorized by stroke color and opacity for annotation. A point chart overlays the matrix, with point sizes encoding quantitative values and colored in green. The dashed grid lines and a color legend enhance data interpretation, making it easier to discern patterns and variations within the matrix.
