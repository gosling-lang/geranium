The visualization consists of three linear genomic tracks displayed in a horizontal arrangement. Each track represents gene annotations along chromosome 3 from 52,168,000 to 52,890,000 base pairs. 

### Track 1: HiGlass
- **Annotations and Marks**:
  - Right and left-facing triangles indicating gene directions.
  - Text labels for gene names.
  - Rectangles represent exons.
  - Lines with patterned ends depicting gene boundaries and strand direction.
- **Color Encoding**:
  - Positive strand genes are colored in blue.
  - Negative strand genes are colored in orange.

### Track 2: IGV
- **Annotations and Marks**:
  - Text labels for gene names with rectangles indicating genomic extent.
  - Transparent white lines depict strand direction with patterned ends.
- **Color Encoding**:
  - All elements are predominantly in sky blue, indicating a uniform color scheme.

### Track 3: Corces et al.
- **Annotations and Marks**:
  - Smaller text labels for gene names with blue and orange color tones.
  - Rectangles represent exons, sized differently from Track 1.
  - Lines used to denote gene boundaries without arrowheads.
- **Color Encoding**:
  - Strand-specific coloring, similar to HiGlass, with blue for positive and orange for negative strands.

### Additional Information
- All tracks are overlay-oriented, emphasizing the genomic intervals they represent.
- The entire layout has a consistent linear style, providing a
