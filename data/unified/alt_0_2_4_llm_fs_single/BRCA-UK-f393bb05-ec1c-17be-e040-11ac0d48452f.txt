The visualization features a circular and a linear view displayed vertically. The circular view presents the full genome with a linked blue interactive brush to the linear view, focusing on chromosome 1. It contains five tracks: an ideogram, a point annotation track, two range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' and a line-connection track showing structural variations such as 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion' in distinct colors.

The linear view mirrors these tracks with additional details: a gene annotation track with triangles and rectangles denoting gene positions and orientations, and a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' representing VCF file data as points colored by mutation subtype. Additional range annotation tracks show insertions and deletions with color-coded rectangles. The 'Copy Number Variants' and its positions are represented as gray rectangles. The circular and linear views are unified by consistent styling elements, enhancing coherence in visual data representation.
