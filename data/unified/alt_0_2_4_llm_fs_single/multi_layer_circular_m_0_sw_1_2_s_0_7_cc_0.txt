A circular scatter plot in a circular layout visualizes a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The chart displays multiple rows with different sample categories, each represented by distinct colors. Points represent genomic data, with the y-axis depicting expression values. Rows are defined by the 'sample' field, and each rowâ€™s visibility is determined by different opacity levels. The colors used include shades of blue, orange, green, and purple, among others. This visualization emphasizes graphical perception of multiple time series, as referenced from Javed et al.'s 2010 study.
