A circular and linear layout visualization represents genomic data from the hg19 assembly. The circular view includes an ideogram, a "Putative Driver" text annotation track, and range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in blue and orange, respectively. A connection track shows structural variations colored based on categories like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication,' using data from a CSV file. The charts are interactively linked by a blue brush, highlighting chromosome 1.

The linear view, aliased to chromosome 1, contains a gene annotation track, a "Point Mutation" scatterplot displaying VCF data, and range annotation tracks for insertion, deletion, and copy number variants. The scatterplot points are categorized by 'SUBTYPE,' with placement indicating distance to the previous mutation. Additional tracks, like the ideogram with directional triangles and text for gene names, offer detailed genomic insights.
