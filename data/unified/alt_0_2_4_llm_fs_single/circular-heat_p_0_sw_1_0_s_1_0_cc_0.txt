The circular heatmap titled "Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts" with the subtitle "Heatmap" visualizes data from chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. The layout is circular with a vertical arrangement and a center radius of 0.5. It is structured with horizontal views containing multiple tracks. Each track is represented by rectangular marks, which are colored based on quantitative values from a field named 'peak', using a 'hot' range color scale. The data is stratified by 'sample' categories, including 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', displayed in separate rows, each with its respective legend. The heatmap displays genomic data fetched from a multivec file, detailing positions and peaks, and offers tooltips for detailed information, including start and end genomic positions and peak values.
