A genomic heatmap displays two overlaid matrix tracks. The chart visualizes genomic interactions along chromosome 10. The x- and y-axes represent genomic intervals, with expression values encoded by color intensity. The first track uses a grey color scale, while the second track employs a pink color scale. Both tracks extend across the full matrix, with annotations indicating different levels of quantitative values. This visualization is part of a horizontal arrangement with responsive resizing capabilities, adjusting to screen width. The display is interactive, allowing exploration of detailed data points through linked tracks.
