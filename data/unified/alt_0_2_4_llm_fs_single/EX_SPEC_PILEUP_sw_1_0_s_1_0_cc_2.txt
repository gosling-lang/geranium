The visualization displays a coverage and pileup track using BAM data in a linear layout, focusing on chromosome 1 between positions 136,750 and 139,450. The top track is a coverage bar chart showing the number of reads, displayed with silver bars. The bottom track is a pileup chart with rows of rectangles, each row representing different structural variations. The rectangles are colored to indicate various types such as 'normal read,' 'deletion (+-),' 'inversion (++)', 'inversion (--)', 'duplication (-+)', 'more than two mates', 'mates not found within chromosome', and 'clipping.' Colors range from gray to red, distinguishing each category. The entire visualization is titled 'Pileup Track Using BAM Data.'
