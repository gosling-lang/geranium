The visualization, titled "Basic Marks: Triangles," is a genomic annotation track displayed in a linear layout. It shows the genome on the x-axis and highlights specific positions using triangles. The chart is categorized by strand, with right-facing blue triangles representing the '+' strand and left-facing red triangles representing the '-' strand. The size of each triangle is constant, and the chart is stratified by rows for strand categories. This track offers an interactive view of genomic data related to gene annotations, allowing for clear distinction between different strands. The subtitle is "Tutorial Examples."
