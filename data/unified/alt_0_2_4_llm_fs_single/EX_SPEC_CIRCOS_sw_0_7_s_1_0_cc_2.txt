A circular layout visualization depicting genomic data, titled "Circos." This plot consists of three main components: a bar chart representing genomic positions with green bars illustrating expression values, an ideogram using rects to delineate chromosome intervals with colors signifying different categories, and connection lines highlighting segment duplications. The connections are color-coded based on chromosome identifiers, with a semi-transparent overlay to enhance visual clarity. The data is arranged concentrically, portraying the entire genome as circular bands.
