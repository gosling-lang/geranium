The visualization is a scatter plot in a linear layout, showing genomic data from the hg38 assembly. Points represent expression values mapped on the y-axis and genomic positions on the x-axis, with size encoding the 'peak' data field. The green color represents data points, and categories include 'sample 1.' The plot is titled 'Basic Marks: point' with a subtitle 'Tutorial Examples.' Data is retrieved from a multivec file, illustrating expression variations across different genomic positions.
