The visualization is a horizontal matrix representation comparing Micro-C and Hi-C data for HFFc6 cells on chromosome 7, between positions 77,700,000 and 81,000,000. It contains two primary views arranged vertically, each featuring multiple tracks. 

The first vertical view displays: 
- **HFFc6_H3K4me3:** A bar chart with bars colored in dark green, showing genomic intervals along the x-axis and expression levels on the y-axis.
- **HFFc6_ATAC:** A bar chart with orange bars indicating genomic expression levels.
- **HFFc6_CTCF:** Includes overlay tracks with navy blue bars and genomic annotations using pink and green triangles, representing strand directions.
- **HFFc6_Micro-C:** This is a matrix chart using color intensity encoding for expression values, spanning both x- and y-axes. The color range used is 'bupu'.

The second vertical view mirrors the first in setup but includes:
- **HFFc6_Hi-C:** Another matrix chart similar to 'Micro-C', using 'bupu' color ranges.
- An **Epilogos (hg38)** bar chart, displaying genomic categories using varied colors, indicating different genomic features like 'Active TSS,' 'Enhancers,' etc.

Both views incorporate various genomic data types, such as bigwig for signal data and beddb for annotation, utilizing encoded color schemes to differentiate expression levels and categories. The
