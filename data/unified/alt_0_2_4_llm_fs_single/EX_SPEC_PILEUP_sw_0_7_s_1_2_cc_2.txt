A linear visualization of a BAM file displays genomic data for chromosome 1 between positions 136,750 and 139,450. The top track shows a coverage bar chart with silver bars indicating the number of reads, while the bottom track, a pileup chart, depicts alignments with varying colors indicating different types of structural variations such as 'normal read', 'deletion', 'inversion', 'duplication', and more. The color coding facilitates easy identification of these categories. The visualization is titled "Pileup Track Using BAM Data" and includes a legend for insert sizes set to 300bp.
