The visualization comprises a circular and linear view, arranged vertically. The circular view displays the entire genome, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. Both views are linked by an interactive blue brush. The circular view contains five tracks: an ideogram, a text annotation track titled "Putative Driver," and three range annotation tracks named "Gain," "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and a connection track visualizing structural variations. Colors in the circular view represent different categories such as "Gain" (blue) and "LOH" (orange). The linear view includes similar tracks, with additional layers for gene annotations, a "Point Mutation" scatterplot, and copy number variations. The scatterplot uses points to depict mutations colored by subtype, while the connection track illustrates chromosomal rearrangements through colored lines.
