A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file, representing genomic data for chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500. The chart includes four rows corresponding to 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4,' each depicted in a distinct color: orange, green, blue, and pink respectively. The bars represent the quantitative 'peak' values, stratified by sample categories. The layout is static, and the circular design allows for an at-a-glance comparison of the sample data across the specified genomic range.
