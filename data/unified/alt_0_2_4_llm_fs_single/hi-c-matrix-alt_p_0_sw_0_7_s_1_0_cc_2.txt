A multi-layered chart visualizing Hi-C data in a linear layout. The main track is a matrix displaying genomic interactions across chromosomes 5 to 10, with the intensity of interactions represented by a color gradient from light yellow to dark brown. Overlaid on the matrix are several rule annotations: vertical lines on the x-axis in purple for chromosomes 2, 5, and 10, and horizontal lines on the y-axis in green. Additional annotations include specific genomic intervals represented as bars for chromosomes 6, 7, and 8, colored by quantitative values, and a scatter of points colored green, their size indicating the variation magnitude. The overall visualization spans a genomic interval from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000, with interactive elements and subtle background styling for enhanced readability. The chart is titled "Hi-C Matrix" with a subtitle "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations."
