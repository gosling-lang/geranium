The provided linear bar chart visualizes a multivec file, depicting segments of the hg38 genome across chromosomes. The bars represent genomic intervals on the x-axis, while the peak expression values, derived from a field named 'peak,' are plotted on the y-axis. The bars are uniformly colored in green, with a consistent size value of 5 units. The visualization is titled "Basic Marks: bar" with a subtitle "Tutorial Examples," offering a straightforward representation of chromosomal data, suitable for identifying variations in genomic regions.
