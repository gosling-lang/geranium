The visualization features two views in a vertical arrangement: a circular view and a linear view linked by a blue interactive brush. The circular view displays the entire genome assembly (hg19), with an ideogram, genomic annotations, and interchromosomal connections. The ideogram shows chromosome bands, while range annotations highlight regions of genomic gain and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) colored in blue and orange, respectively. A text track displays gene annotations, and connections represent structural variations like translocations and duplications, distinguished by color.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, providing a more detailed analysis. It includes an ideogram, gene annotations, point mutations, and copy number variations. The point mutation track features a scatter plot indicating mutation subtypes, displayed in various colors. The copy number variations track shows quantitative data in grey bars. Both views complement each other, offering a comprehensive genomic landscape with intricate details across different structural variants and annotation types.
