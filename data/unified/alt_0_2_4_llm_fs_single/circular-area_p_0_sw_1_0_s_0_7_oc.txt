A circular visualization in a vertical arrangement displays genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 to 3,000,500. This static chart uses an area mark to represent quantitative 'peak' values along the y-axis, while the x-axis features genomic positions. The chart is stratified into four rows for different samples, each colored uniquely. With a center radius of 0.5, this visualization provides a clear, color-coded representation of expression levels across samples. Each sample is highlighted using a legend, aiding category distinction.
