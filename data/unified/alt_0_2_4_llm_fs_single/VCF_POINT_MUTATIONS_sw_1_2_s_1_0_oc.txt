The visualization is a scatter plot arranged in a linear layout that illustrates point mutations from a VCF file across different chromosomes, using the hg38 assembly. The x-axis represents genomic positions, and the y-axis represents the distance to the previous mutation, displayed logarithmically. Points are colored based on mutation subtypes: C>A, C>G, C>T, T>A, T>C, and T>G, with an opacity value of 0.9. The plot is 720 pixels wide and 160 pixels high, with a legend indicating the color categories for mutation subtypes. The subtitle is "Point mutations from a VCF file," highlighting the focus on genetic variation data.
