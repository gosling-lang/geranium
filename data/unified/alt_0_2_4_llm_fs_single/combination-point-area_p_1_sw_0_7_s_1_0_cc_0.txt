The visualization consists of two charts arranged vertically, showcasing genomic data across chromosome 1. The top chart features an area display stratified by rows for four categories: 'sample 1' through 'sample 4'. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis displays quantitative values. Different categories are colored in blue, orange, green, and red, with a white stroke. The bottom chart is a scatter plot with points indicating expression values on the y-axis and genomic positions on the x-axis. The size of the points corresponds to expression magnitude, and colors indicate categories, aligning with those in the top chart. Both charts provide interactive tooltips showing detailed genomic and data-related information.
