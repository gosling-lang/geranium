A linear visualization displays genomic data across chromosomes 1 to 5 using multivec and CSV files. Each view has two tracks: an area chart representing genomic positions and peak values, and an ideogram with genomic bands. The area charts use multicolored areas to depict expression values for samples 1 to 4. The ideograms show band density with rectangles colored in a gradient of white to black and additional annotations using maroon triangles for centromeres and purple rectangles for gvar regions. The views are arranged serially, with consistent axis alignment and style elements, across a horizontal linear layout.
