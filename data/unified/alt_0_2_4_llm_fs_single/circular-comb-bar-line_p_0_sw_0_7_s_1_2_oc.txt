The visualization consists of two circular layouts representing genomic data related to chromosome 1. The left chart is a circular bar chart showing genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis across four samples. Bars are color-coded by sample categories. The right chart combines a circular line chart and a scatter plot, with genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Lines and points are color-coded by sample categories, with point sizes indicating expression magnitude. The views are arranged side by side.
