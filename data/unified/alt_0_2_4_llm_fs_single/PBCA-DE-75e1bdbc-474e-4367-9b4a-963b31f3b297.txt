This visualization comprises a circular and a linear view linked interactively. The circular layout displays the entire hg19 genome, featuring tracks such as an ideogram with diverse category colors, and annotation tracks showing genomic ranges. The titled 'Gain' track illustrates genomic intervals in blue, while the 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' presents ranges in orange. A link track illustrates connections between genomic loci, represented with various colors based on structural variation types, such as 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion'.

The linear view showcases chromosome 1, integrating an ideogram with triangle annotations, a text track titled 'Putative Driver', and data-rich tracks involving a 'Point Mutation' scatter plot revealing VCF data by mutation distance, along with insertion and deletion annotation tracks. The scatter plot employs colorful points for different subtypes. Additionally, it contains a copy number variants track visualized as gray bars that represent quantitative data ('total_cn'). A legend clarifies the color coding of categories like gain, loss, and structural variations.
