A linear genomic visualization includes an ideogram, a gene annotation track, two tracks with rectangles, and a connection track. The ideogram showcases chromosome 1 with color-coded stain patterns. Gene annotation is displayed with blue and orange triangles, indicating positive and negative strands, respectively. Two rectangle tracks represent copy number variations using purple stripes. The connection track visualizes structural variations with lines connecting genomic positions, colored and stroked based on structural variation class.
