This genomic heatmap visualizes a matrix file representing the entire hg38 genome, using a linear layout. Both the x-axis and y-axis represent genomic coordinates, partitioned into intervals. Each data point is encoded with color intensity on a 'hot' color scale, representing quantitative expression values. The heatmap's axes depict genomic start and end positions, with contextual labeling for chromosomes. The display is static, with dimensions set to 310x310 pixels.
