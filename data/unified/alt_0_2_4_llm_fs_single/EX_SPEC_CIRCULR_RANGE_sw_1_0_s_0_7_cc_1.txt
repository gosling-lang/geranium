The visualization is a circular bar chart that displays genomic data using a vector file format. It shows the entire genome on the x-axis in a circular layout, while the expression levels are represented on the y-axis as bars radiating from the center. The bars are colored in sky blue. The visualization is static and uses an alignment of "stack" with a spacing of 1 and a center radius of 0.3, focusing on the assembly hg38. The data is derived from a specified URL, with 'position' as the genomic field and 'peak' as the quantitative field.
