The visualization consists of a circular view and a linear view arranged vertically. An interactive blue brush in the circular view links the two views. The circular view displays the entire hg19 genome, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. The circular section contains an ideogram, point annotation track, two range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)', and a line-connection track representing structural variations. The linear view mirrors these tracks and adds a gene annotation track, a scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation', and additional annotation tracks for insertions and deletions. The scatterplot uses points to display mutation distances, with each point color representing different mutation subtypes. The tracks visualize data through bar heights and colored rectangles, indicating quantitative data such as copy numbers and structural variations like translocations, duplications, and inversions.
