A linear layout visualization with two linked genomic line charts depicting genomic data on chromosome 1 from a multivec file. The top chart, set with a brush tool in steel blue, allows interaction by highlighting a specific region linked to the bottom chart. Both tracks display 'peak' values as yellow lines, with the top chart showing an overview of chromosome 1, while the bottom provides a zoomed-in view of the interval 200,000,000 to 220,000,000, shaded with light steel blue for enhanced focus. The visualization is titled "Example: Brushing and Linking" and showcases brushing/linking interaction techniques.
