The visualization is a multi-layer circular area chart displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, within the interval 1 to 3,000,500. It uses a multivec file format and consists of four layers, each representing different samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'). Each layer is colored differently—yellow, green, blue, and pink—and displays quantitative peak values along the y-axis. The x-axis represents genomic positions. This circular layout allows comparison of expression patterns across samples, with color indicating the sample category. The chart is static and designed for genomic-analysis purposes.
