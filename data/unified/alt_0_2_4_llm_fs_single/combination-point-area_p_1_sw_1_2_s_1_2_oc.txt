The visualization consists of two vertically arranged linear tracks, each displaying genomic data for chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is an area chart visualizing multivec data. It is stratified into four rows representing 'sample 1' to 'sample 4', each with a distinct color. The area chart shows the expression levels along the y-axis. The bottom track is a scatter plot with points representing expression levels. The size and color of the points, representing 'sample 1' to 'sample 4', provide additional details. The visualization effectively uses color to differentiate between samples, incorporating interactive tooltips to display specific data values such as start, end positions, and peak value.
