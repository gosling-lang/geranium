The visualization is a circular area chart representing a multivec file, covering chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. It displays expression values as areas stratified into 16 categories, each represented by a different color. The data field 'peak' is used for the quantitative measure on the y-axis. The area chart is divided into multiple opacity layers to display different ranges of data intensity. The categories are 'sample 1' through 'sample 16,' excluding 'sample -.' This chart provides a multi-dimensional view of genomic data, enhancing interpretability by varying color and opacity.
