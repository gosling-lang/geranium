This visualization, titled "Single-cell Epigenomic Analysis," features a linear, vertically arranged representation of chromosome 3, as analyzed by Corces et al. in 2020. The top track displays an ideogram of chromosome 3 with color-coded cytogenetic bands. A red brush allows linking to detailed views. Below, seven bar charts represent genomic data for different neuron types and glial cells, such as excitatory, inhibitory, dopaminergic neurons, microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and OPCs. Each chart uses unique colors to signify expression values, such as orange for excitatory neurons and blue for oligodendrocytes. Further, a gene annotation track shows gene names and exons using text and rectangles, with blue denoting positive strands and red negative strands. At the bottom, three tracks with light connections depict PLAC-seq interactions involving different cell types, with transparent lines linking genomic regions. This detailed depiction facilitates the exploration of epigenomic structures across different neural cell types.
