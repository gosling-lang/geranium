A bar chart in a linear layout visualizes genomic data from a multivec file, displaying the genome of hg38 in intervals on the x-axis. The height of each bar represents the expression values encoded by the data field named 'peak.' The width of bars is consistent, and the track has a unique height assignment of 156 pixels. The chart features the title 'Basic Marks: bar' and the subtitle 'Tutorial Examples,' providing a clear tutorial-style visualization. Bars are presented in bold orange, accentuating the quantitative differences along the genomic axis.
