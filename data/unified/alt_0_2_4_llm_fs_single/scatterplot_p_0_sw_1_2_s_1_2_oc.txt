A scatter plot in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, displaying chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. Points are used to represent genomic positions, with the x-axis indicating the genomic position and the y-axis indicating expression values. The size of each point corresponds to the expression value, and colors represent different categories, including 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The plot includes interactive tooltips providing genomic start and end positions, expression values, and sample category. The plot is semi-transparent, with an opacity level of 0.5.
