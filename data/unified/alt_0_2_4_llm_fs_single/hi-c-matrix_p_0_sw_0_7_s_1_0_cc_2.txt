The visualization, titled "Hi-C Matrix," showcases genomic data using a matrix and annotations. Positioned in a linear layout, it spans across a specified genomic interval from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 on the hg38 assembly. The central feature is an overlaid Hi-C matrix presented with genomic intervals on both axes, where color intensity reflects expression values. The spectrum ranges from light to dark shades, guided by a legend, to illustrate quantitative data patterns.

The visualization integrates diverse tracks:
- **Track 1:** A colored matrix where expression levels are encoded by color intensity.
- **Track 2:** Vertical genomic annotation lines in sky blue, enhancing genomic positions.
- **Track 3:** Horizontal lines in purple, offering genomic context across annotations.
- **Track 4:** Genomic bar annotations for chromosomes 6, 7, and 8, where stroke colors differentiate categories within the dataset.
- **Track 5:** Purple points scattered across the matrix, coded by their genomic size and value, providing clarity on expression intensity.

The individual datasets, distinguished by their colors and stroke widths, indicate various structures within the chromosomal data, emphasizing structural patterns and variations. These elements collectively work to convey a complex genomic landscape efficiently, supported by a coherent visual style to improve interpretability and engagement.
