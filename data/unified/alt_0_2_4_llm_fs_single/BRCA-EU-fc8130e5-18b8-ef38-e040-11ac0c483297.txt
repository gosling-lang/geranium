A circular and linear visualization is used to represent genomic data, featuring the hg19 assembly. The circular layout at the top includes multiple annotation tracks such as an ideogram, text annotations for putative drivers, gains, and losses of heterozygosity (LOH), as well as connections representing various structural variants. This view is linked via an interactive blue brush to a detailed linear view below, focusing on chromosome 1.

The circular ideogram uses colors to categorize different genomic features. Text annotations highlight putative drivers, colored black, while gains are shown in sky blue rectangles and LOH in dark orange rectangles. Structural variants, displayed as connections within the circle, are color-coded based on variant type: gain, LOH, translocation, duplication, deletion, and inversions (TtT and HtH).

The linear view provides a zoomed perspective of chromosome 1, with tracks similar to the circular view but include additional details: a gene annotation track with transcripts and exons, and a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" that uses a VCF file showing mutation types through different point colors. Rectangles represent insertion and deletion categories, while the "Copy Number Variants" track visualizes data with gray bars. This visual approach integrates multilevel genomic data to facilitate comprehensive analysis.
