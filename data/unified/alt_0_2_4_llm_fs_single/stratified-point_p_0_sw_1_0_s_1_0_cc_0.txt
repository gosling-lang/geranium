The visualization is a scatter plot in a linear layout, showcasing multivec data of chromosome 1 within the range from 1 to 3,000,500. Four samples are represented in separate rows, each colored differently: blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis shows genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative peak values. The size and opacity of the points indicate the magnitude of peak values, enhancing visual analysis. This plot facilitates the comparison of expression values across samples and genomic positions, with a tooltip providing detailed information for each data point.
