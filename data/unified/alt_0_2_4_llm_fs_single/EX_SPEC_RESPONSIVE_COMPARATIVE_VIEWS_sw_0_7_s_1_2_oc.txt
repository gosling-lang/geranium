A series of three linear bar charts depict genomic intervals for chromosomes 9 and 12, between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. These charts utilize a multivec data file, with each chart representing a different color for the bars: navy blue, orange, and dark yellow. The y-axis displays the quantitative 'peak' values, while the x-axis represents genomic positions between 'start' and 'end.' The bars have white borders with a stroke width of 0.5. The visualization adapts to different screen sizes, arranging horizontally for wider displays and shifting to a vertical arrangement when the width is less than 1200 pixels.
