The visualization comprises two tracks arranged in a linear layout showcasing BAM file data for chromosome 1, ranging from positions 136,750 to 139,450. The top track is a bar chart displaying coverage levels, with silver bars representing the number of reads. The bottom track is a pileup chart using rectangles to depict individual reads, categorized by structural variations such as 'normal read', 'deletion (+-)', 'inversion (++/--)', and others. Colors across the chart—ranging from gray to various shades like orange and red—indicate different structural variation types. The visualization allows examination of read alignments with additional details like insert size and mate pair information available via tooltips. The visualization is titled "Pileup Track Using BAM Data".
