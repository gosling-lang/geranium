A linear layout visualization displays genomic data from chromosome 1 spanning 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs, using two scatter plots. Both tracks feature points representing 'peak' values from a multivec file. In the top scatter plot, the genome position is plotted along the x-axis, and peak expression values are depicted on the y and size axes. Different categories ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4') are indicated by distinct point colors. The bottom scatter plot stratifies the data by categories in separate rows, maintaining color distinctions. Both charts offer interactive tooltips and have a center radius of 0.8.
