The visualization features a combined circular and linear layout demonstrating genomic data from the human reference genome hg19. The circular view presents a comprehensive genome representation, showcasing multiple tracks including an ideogram, annotated regions, and connections illustrating different structural variants. Notably, categories like 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' are highlighted using blue and orange respectively. The linear view expands on chromosome 1, detailing specific genomic features such as gene annotations, point mutations, and copy number variants. This view further distinguishes variant types like 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' through distinct color coding. Interactive elements include a blue brush linking both views, enhancing the analysis by connecting genome-wide data to a detailed chromosome-level perspective.
