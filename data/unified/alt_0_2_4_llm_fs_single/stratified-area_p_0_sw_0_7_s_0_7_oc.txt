A linear layout area chart visualizes multivec data for chromosome 1 ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. The chart features four rows representing samples 1 to 4, each colored differently. The x-axis shows genomic positions, while the y-axis represents the 'peak' value, with a white stroke outlining each area. This visualization also includes tooltips for genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample identifiers.
