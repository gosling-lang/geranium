A circular line chart visualizes a multivec data file, displaying chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. It features multiple time series data across 16 samples, differentiated by color. The expression values are encoded into radial lines, and they are laid out in a circular grid around a central point. Each line's vertical position corresponds to the "peak" data field, with varying opacities to represent diverse expression levels. The chart is split into several bands based on specific peak value ranges, highlighting the quantitative data. The visualization is based on graphical perception principles.
