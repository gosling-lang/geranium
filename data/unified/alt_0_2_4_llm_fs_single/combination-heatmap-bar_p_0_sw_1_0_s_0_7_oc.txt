The visualization consists of two vertically arranged linear charts displaying genomic data across chromosome 1, from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top chart is a heat map, encoding expression values with color intensity, and is stratified into four rows representing different samples. The bottom chart is a bar chart, depicting expression values on the y-axis with bars, also stratified by rows for each sample. The samples are color-coded and include 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The dataset used is multivec, with genomic positions marked on the x-axis. The view is interactive, with tooltips providing detailed genomic and value information.
