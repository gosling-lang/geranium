The visualization is a linear genomic chart titled "Insertions and deletions from a VCF file," displaying genomic positions on the x-axis across several chromosomes. There are two stratified rows labeled "Insertion" and "Deletion," each depicted with colored rectangles. Insertions are shown in orange, while deletions appear in green. The genome's position is represented on the x-axis, and the transparency of rectangles indicates the relative frequency of events. This visual representation helps in analyzing structural variations depicted in a VCF file.
