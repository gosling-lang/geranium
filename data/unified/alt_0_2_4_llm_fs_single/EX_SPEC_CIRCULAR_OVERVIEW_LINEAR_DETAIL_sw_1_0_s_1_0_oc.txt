The visualization consists of a circular and linear arrangement, using data from a multivec file and CSV for genomic alignment. The circular view includes two tracks: a bar chart showing genomic data stratified by categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4', colored differently, and a connection track illustrating genomic rearrangements across chromosomes with strokes indicating types like deletion, inversion, translocation, and tandem-duplication. Below, two linear bar charts detail specific genomic regions of chromosomes 5 and 16, linked with the circular chart via interactive brushes. The linear charts share a similar category-based stratification, with background colors enhancing visibility and differentiation for multimodal searching.
