The visualization features a linear, vertical layout with two distinct tracks analyzing chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a multicolor line chart representing genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative expression values on the y-axis. Different lines, colored per category, display data from various samples. The bottom track combines an area chart and a line chart, both stratified by sample categories. This track highlights expression values with a combination of lines and filled areas, further enhancing data distinction by categories, indicated by distinct colors. The visualization employs multivec data type, focusing on the 'peak' field, with tooltips providing detailed information about genomic positions, values, and sample identities.
