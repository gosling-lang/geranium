The visualization utilizes a linear layout to display genomic data with Gosling.js, showcasing three distinct tracks. The genomic range annotation track visualizes gene annotations on chromosome 3 within the interval 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. It features directional markers and gene names in gray, with a smooth path style. The bar chart represents a sequence track on chromosome 1, focusing on the interval 77,925,299 to 77,925,320. It highlights nucleotide bases ('A', 'T', 'G', 'C'), with bars colored to indicate base categories. Lastly, an ideogram track spans the entire length of chromosome 1, displaying cytogenetic bands with text labels and colored rectangles and triangles indicating different staining patterns. The title of the visualization is "Track Template In Gosling.js," and it aims to demonstrate how track templates simplify the creation of complex genomic visualizations.
