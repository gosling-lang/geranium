The visualization presents a linear genomic annotation track, focusing on chromosome 3, between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The track titled "Corces et al." displays genes and exons as horizontal lines. Gene names are shown as text labels alongside the graphical representation of genes. Exons are represented as thicker segments along the lines. The chart is stratified by rows based on strands, with blue for the positive strand and red for the negative strand. This horizontal arrangement provides a clear annotation of gene locations and orientations.
