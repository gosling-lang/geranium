The visualization is a heat map with a linear layout representing a matrix dataset titled "HFFc6_Micro-C." It visualizes genomic interactions using a matrix file from the hg38 assembly. The x-axis and y-axis both represent genomic coordinates, encoded without direct axes, emphasizing the genomic intervals. Color intensity on the map, which ranges from cool to hot colors, scales with the quantitative expression values, highlighting interaction intensities within the genome. The map spans a width of 504 units and a height of 720 units, efficiently encoding dense genomic data interactions with color as the main visual encoding method.
