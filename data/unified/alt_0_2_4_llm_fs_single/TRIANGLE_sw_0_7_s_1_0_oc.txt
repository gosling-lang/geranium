The visualization is a genomic position annotation track titled "Basic Marks: Triangles." It features a linear layout displaying genomic data with two types of triangular markers indicating gene direction. Rightward blue triangles represent the '+' strand, while leftward red triangles signify the '-' strand. The chart is stratified by strand, using both position and color for categorical encoding. The x-axis presents various chromosomes, emphasizing genomic intervals. The layout is interactive, supporting opacity control and static arrangement with defined zoom limits for detailed genomic analysis. The subtitle "Tutorial Examples" provides context for its instructional use.
