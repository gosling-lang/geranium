The visualization is a multi-track circular plot displaying genomic data from chromosomes 1 through 5 in a parallel arrangement. Each chromosome is represented by a circular track showing genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis using an area chart. The colors of the areas correspond to four different sample categories: sample 1, sample 2, sample 3, and sample 4. Overlaid on each area chart is an ideogram depicting cytogenetic bands with varying densities indicated by shades of gray, black, and colors specific to categories like gvar and acen. Text annotations, as well as maroon triangles, represent cytogenetic features such as specific bands and centromere locations. This interactive and static visualization effectively combines quantitative expression data with structural genomic features.
