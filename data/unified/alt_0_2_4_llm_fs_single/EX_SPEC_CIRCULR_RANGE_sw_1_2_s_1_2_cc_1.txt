A circular bar chart in a stacked layout visualizes a vector file, showing the entire genome of hg38. The position is mapped on the x-axis, while the peak values are represented on the y-axis using bars. The bars are colored in sky blue. The chart is static and spans the entire circle with a radius that emphasizes the center. The data comes from a specific URL that provides genomic information.
