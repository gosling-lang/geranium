The visualization is a bar chart in a linear layout, depicting genomic data along chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500 on the hg38 assembly. It uses bars to represent quantitative 'peak' values on the y-axis, with different colors signifying four categories ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'). The x-axis displays genomic positions with a top axis label, and gridlines are present for ease of interpretation. The tooltip provides detailed information about start and end genomic positions and peak values.
