This visualization consists of two aligned charts in a linear layout, displaying genomic data for chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The top section is a scatter plot where each row represents a 'sample' category. Points on the y-axis indicate 'peak' values, differentiated by color and size based on 'sample' and 'peak' values respectively. The bottom section is a line chart illustrating the same genomic regions. Lines, in distinct colors for each 'sample' category, show fluctuations in 'peak' values across positions. Both charts include interactive tooltips for detailed data insights.
