Linear visualization of genomic data for chromosome 1 from the hg38 assembly. The ideogram track displays banding patterns, with categories indicated by different colors, including rectangles, and left and right triangles. A genomic position annotation track is stratified by strand, showing forward (blue triangles) and reverse strands (orange triangles) in different rows. Two tracks depict copy number variations in tumor samples: one with green rectangles for minor copy number zero and another with purple rectangles for total copy numbers above 4.5. A rearrangement track shows genomic connections, with lines colored based on structural variant classes such as tandem-duplication and translocation.
