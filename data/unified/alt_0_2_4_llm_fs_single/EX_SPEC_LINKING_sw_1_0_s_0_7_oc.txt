The visualization titled "Visual Linking" consists of a circular bar chart and two linear bar charts, designed to explore genomic data from chromosome 1. The circular chart displays genomic intervals through stratified rows and color-coded categories, linked to a linear chart via an interactive brush. This brush allows users to select specific regions, updating the detail view in the bottom linear chart focusing on chromosome 1 between positions 160,000,000 and 200,000,000. Data is encoded with multivec format, reflecting quantitative "peak" values and categorized by "sample." Each track is visually distinguished by distinct colors for each category, enhancing the exploration of genomic features within the selected regions.
