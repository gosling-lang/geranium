A visualization depicting "Visual Linking" across chromosome 1 from 160,000,000 to 200,000,000 uses a vertical arrangement to illustrate genomic data from four samples. The top chart is a scatter plot showing genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis with points. Samples are differentiated by rows and colors: orange, green, blue, and purple. The lower section includes a circular line chart on the left and an area chart on the right. Both show genomic intervals on the x-axis, stratified by sample and color. An interactive brush connects these views, allowing dynamic updates when adjusted.
