The visualization compares two approaches, titled "New Approach: Stretching Tiles" and "Original Approach," for visualizing genomic data within the interval [350, 396]. The layout is linear, with the genome shown on the x-axis. Each track is stratified by rows representing categories, with rectangles colored by category. The "Smoother Zoom" title and subtitle indicate that this visualization focuses on zooming without redrawing elements. Data is sourced from a CSV file and text annotations are visible when zoomed in to a specified level. Both approaches use rectangles and text in black, and utilize multiple colors to depict different base categories.
