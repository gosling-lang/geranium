A vertical linear bar chart visualizes genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. The data, sourced from a multivec file, is displayed across four samples labeled 'sample 1' to 'sample 4.' The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis quantifies expression values with gridlines for clarity. Bars are color-coded to differentiate between samples, using shades of blue, orange, green, and red. Interactive tooltips provide additional data insight, including start and end positions, peaks, and sample identification.
