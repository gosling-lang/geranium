The visualization depicts two horizontally arranged linear genomic tracks covering chromosome 3 from position 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. The left track, titled 'IGV', displays gene annotations with text labels in green. Genes are represented by rectangles in green, accompanied by arrows indicating strand direction with white lines.  The right track annotates genomic ranges with text labels in sky blue. Gene regions are highlighted in pink, exons in purple, and introns in pink. Both tracks are stratified by strand, enhancing distinct category visualization.
