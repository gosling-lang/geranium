The visualization features a circular ideogram and a linear view, arranged vertically. The circular view, showing the complete genome, serves as an overview, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. These views are connected by a blue brush for interactive exploration. The circular view includes tracks such as a colored ideogram, a "Putative Driver" text track, and tracks for gain and loss of heterozygosity (LOH), each represented in specific colors. Furthermore, a connection track illustrates structural variations with various colors denoting categories like 'Gain', 'LOH', and 'Translocation'.

The linear view provides detailed tracks, including a gene annotation track and a "Point Mutation" scatter plot, colored by mutation subtype. Additional tracks display insertions and deletions in distinct hues, and a "Copy Number Variants" track shows quantitative data. Rectangles depict genomic ranges, with vertical lines marking important genomic positions across the tracks. This detailed composition provides a comprehensive genomic mapping, ideal for visualizing complex genomic data and variations in the context of human chromosome analysis.
