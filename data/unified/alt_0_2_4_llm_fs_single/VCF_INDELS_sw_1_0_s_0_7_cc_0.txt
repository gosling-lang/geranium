The visualization is a linear plot illustrating insertions and deletions from a VCF file across multiple chromosomes. The chart is titled with the subtitle "Insertions and deletions from a VCF file." It uses a rectangular mark to depict each mutation event, with the x-axis representing genomic positions. Rows separate two categories: 'Insertion' and 'Deletion.' Each category is assigned a distinct color, specifically orange for insertions and green for deletions. The genomic range is encoded along the x-axis, with specific chromosomes like chr1, chr3, chr5, and others labeled for reference. Visibility adjustments ensure optimal display across zoom levels, and tooltips provide detailed information, including genomic positions (POS, POSEND), mutation type (MUTTYPE), and other related attributes. The visualization is interactive, set on a light gray (#F6F6F6) background, enhancing contrast and readability.
