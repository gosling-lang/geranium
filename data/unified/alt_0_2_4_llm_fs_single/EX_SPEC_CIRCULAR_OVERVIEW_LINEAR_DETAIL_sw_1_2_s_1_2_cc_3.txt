The visualization presents a multi-dimensional genomic display combining circular and linear layouts. The circular layout at the top uses a stacked arrangement to showcase categorical data from four samples, represented by multicolored bars. This view includes genomic intervals on the x-axis and quantitative peaks on the y-axis. Connections within the circle indicate different genomic rearrangements, categorized by types like deletion, inversion, translocation, and tandem-duplication, distinguished by colored strokes.

Below, two linear bar charts offer detailed views of chromosomes 5 and 16, corresponding to the brushes highlighted in the circular chart. These charts show stratified categories by rows, using consistent color schemes to represent the same sample categories as in the circular layout. This design allows for an in-depth exploration of specific genomic regions, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of structural variations.
