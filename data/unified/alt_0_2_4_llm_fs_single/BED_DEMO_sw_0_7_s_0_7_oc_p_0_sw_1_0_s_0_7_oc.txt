The visualization consists of four tracks arranged vertically, each displaying genomic data in a linear layout for chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 2,000,000. Each track represents different BED file specifications. The top track, titled "BED12: All 12 standard fields," uses rectangles to illustrate genomic intervals with black strokes. The second track, titled "BED6: A file with the first 6 BED fields," also employs rectangles to depict intervals. The third track, "BED6+6: A file with the first 6 BED fields, and 6 custom fields," uses custom fields for genomic positioning. The final track, "BED12+1: A file with all 12 standard fields, and a single extra custom field," similarly visualizes intervals with rectangles. Each track presents data using black strokes, enhancing the clear distinction of genomic intervals. This structured layout effectively demonstrates the capabilities of utilizing various BED file formats in data visualization.
