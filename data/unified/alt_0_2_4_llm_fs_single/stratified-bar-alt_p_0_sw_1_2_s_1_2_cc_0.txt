A layered bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The chart features four rows, one for each sample, namely 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is represented by bars, colored in blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The y-axis represents a range of quantitative values, from 'peak_min' to 'peak_max'. Additional interaction is facilitated through tooltips displaying specific position and peak values when hovering over bars.
