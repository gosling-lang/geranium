The visualization comprises five linear tracks for chromosome 1 using hg38 assembly. An ideogram with colored rectangles and triangles represents genomic bands and centromeres. A gene annotation track displays directional markers (blue and orange triangles) on two rows per strand. Two tracks show genomic regions with colored rectangles: purple indicates minor copy number in tumors, while green indicates total copy number variation. The final track illustrates genomic rearrangements with curved links in various colors, representing different structural variant classes such as tandem-duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions.
