The linear visualization displays three aligned genomic range annotation tracks focused on chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The first track, titled "HiGlass," uses different symbols to denote genomic features, with colors indicating strands: blue for "+" and red for "-". The second track, "IGV," employs a navy color for similar features. The final track, "Corces et al.," includes text annotations in blue and red to represent strands. Each track uses rectangles and rules to visualize the exons and gene names, providing a comprehensive view of the genomic data across different studies or methods.
