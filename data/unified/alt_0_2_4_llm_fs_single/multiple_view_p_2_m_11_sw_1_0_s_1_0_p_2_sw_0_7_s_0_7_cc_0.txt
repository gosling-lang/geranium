The visualization titled "Visual Linking" consists of a vertical arrangement of two main views. The top view includes a circular line chart and an area chart, both displaying genomic data for chromosome 1 across four samples. The circular chart uses lines stratified by category and color, with an interactive brush linking to the linear charts. The area chart showcases genomic intervals with filled areas, similarly stratified by category and color, and includes a brush for interaction.

The bottom view, linked by the brushes, is a linear layout presenting a detailed view of chromosome 1 from 160,000,000 to 200,000,000 using a scatter plot. This plot represents expression levels with points, stratified by sample categories indicated by different colors. The visual linking allows dynamic exploration across different genomic resolutions.
