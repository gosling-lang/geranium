It displays chromosomal bands differentiated by various shades, ranging from white to black, indicating different band densities. Two red triangles are marked on the dark band indicating acrocentric regions. The track shows interval positions with genomic text labels in black and grey. Data is provided from the UCSC Human CytoBand Ideogram dataset and includes a range of feature genres.
