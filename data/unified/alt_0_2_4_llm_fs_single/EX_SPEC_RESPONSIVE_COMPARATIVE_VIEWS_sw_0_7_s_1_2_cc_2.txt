A horizontal arrangement of three bar charts visualizes genomic data for chromosomes 9 and 12. Each chart represents multivec data, with the x-axis showing genomic intervals and the y-axis representing quantitative peak values. The first chart, with a pink hue, shows data for chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The second chart, in purple, presents data from the same start and end positions for chromosome 9. The third chart, in sky blue, mirrors the first chart's settings for chromosome 12. Each bar chart is styled with a white stroke and a width of 504 pixels. The layout is flexible, with automatic width adjustment, allowing responsive visualization in varying screen sizes.
