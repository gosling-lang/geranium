The visualization consists of two tracks arranged vertically in a linear layout, focusing on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 of hg38. The top track is a heat map where expression values are encoded using color intensity, ranging from light to dark colors. It is stratified by four samples represented as rows: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The bottom track is a bar chart showing the expression on the y-axis with bars, stratified by the same samples, and uses distinct colors for each sample. The tooltip provides genomic start and end positions, expression values, and sample information.
