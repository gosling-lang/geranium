The visualization consists of two circular charts presented side by side. On the left, a circular bar chart displays genomic data for chromosome 1, covering positions 1 to 3,000,500. The bars represent expression values across four samples—'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4'—with categories indicated by distinct colors. Each ring corresponds to a different sample. Tooltip information includes genomic start and end positions, expression values, and sample names. On the right, a circular heat map visualizes similar data intervals, encoding expression values by color intensity. The chart is stratified by rows for each sample category, and color intensity reflects quantitative differences in expression values. Both charts are in a static circular layout with a vertical arrangement and centered at a radius of 0.5.
