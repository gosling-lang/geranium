A linear visualization showcasing genomic data across chromosome 1 of the hg38 assembly. The top track displays a colorful ideogram with right and left triangles, indicating various genome regions and categories. Below, two genomic position annotation tracks feature directional triangles colored by strand type: blue for the positive strand and orange for the negative strand.

The following two tracks illustrate copy number variations in tumor cells, shown as sky-blue and green rectangles. The blue rectangles indicate areas where the minor copy number is zero ('Loss of Heterozygosity'), while green rectangles represent regions where the total copy number is increased.

The bottom track visualizes structural variants with connections between genomic positions. The connection lines are colored based on the 'svclass' category, representing different types of structural variations, including tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions.
