The visualization titled "Example: Semantic Zooming" demonstrates an ideogram with chromosomal bands. It uses a linear layout to display genomic intervals along the x-axis, representing chromosomes with varying gray shades. The chart includes functionalities for semantic zooming, revealing text labels and triangle markers for specific chromosomal regions upon zooming in. The background outline is white, and rectangles are outlined in gray. Text color varies with chromosomal stain types, while acen regions are highlighted with maroon triangles.
