A circular multi-line and point chart visualizes a multivec file, covering chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 in the hg38 assembly. Each line and point on the chart represents genomic data from four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Lines are plotted to indicate quantitative 'peak' values across genomic positions, with the size of the points also scaling based on these values. The samples are color-coded: blue, orange, green, and red. The chart is arranged vertically and stratified by rows for each sample category.
