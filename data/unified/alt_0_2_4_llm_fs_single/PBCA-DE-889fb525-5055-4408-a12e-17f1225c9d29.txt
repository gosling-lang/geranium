A circular and linear visualization arrangement shows genomic data of hg19 with a focus on chromosome 1. The circular view includes an ideogram, text annotations for putative drivers, and range annotations for 'Gain' in blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange. It also features connections for various structural variants like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication,' with colors indicating different svclass categories. The linear view elaborates on chromosome 1 with tracks for ideograms, gene annotations, point mutations, insertions, deletions, copy number variants, and structural variants. These tracks use visual codes such as colors, shapes, and tooltips for categories and types, allowing interactive exploration of the genomic data. The visual arrangement is linked by an interactive brush in the circular view, providing an overview and detailed insight across both views.
