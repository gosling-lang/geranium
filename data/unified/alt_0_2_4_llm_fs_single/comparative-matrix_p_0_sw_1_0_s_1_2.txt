The visualization displays an overlaid view of two genomic heatmaps, highlighting interactions within chromosome 10. The layout is horizontal with a linear orientation, utilizing HiGlass matrices. The first matrix visualizes interactions in a lower-left triangular form with grey color encoding intensity, while the second matrix overlays with an upper-right triangular form using pink hues. Both axes represent genomic intervals, emphasizing the expression values through color intensities and legends for clarity. The visualization is responsive to screen width, adjusting spec sizes and dimensions accordingly.
