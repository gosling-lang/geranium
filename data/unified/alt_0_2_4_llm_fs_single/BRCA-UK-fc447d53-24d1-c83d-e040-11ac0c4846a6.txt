The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view, each displaying genomic data in a structured format. The circular view serves as an ideogram illustrating the entire genome, linked to a linear view of chromosome 1 by a blue brush. The circular view includes multiple tracks: an ideogram with colored categories, a labeled track for putative drivers, and tracks showing 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)', represented with sky blue and dark orange rectangles, respectively. Connection lines, colored based on 'svclass', indicate translocations, duplications, deletions, and inversions.

In the linear view, tracks mirror the circular view with added detail: a gene annotation track with triangles and text highlighting exon structures, a scatter plot marking 'Point Mutations' with points colored by 'SUBTYPE', and additional tracks for insertions, deletions, and copy number variants. Functional attributes including tools like tooltips and interactive links enhance exploration of genomic structural variations. The layout is tailored for vertical arrangement and smooth navigation.
