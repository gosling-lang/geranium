The visualization presents three linear bar charts arranged horizontally, each visualizing genomic data from a multivec file. The charts focus on different chromosomal regions, specifically chromosome 12 and chromosome 9, between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The first and third charts display data for chromosome 12, while the middle chart features chromosome 9. Each chart represents quantitative peak values on the y-axis through bars, with genomic intervals on the x-axis.

The bars in the first and third charts are colored purple, while the middle chart displays green bars. The uniform width and height of each chart, responsive to screen size, ensure clarity in comparative genomic expression analysis. This visualization effectively highlights the variations in gene expression across selected chromosome regions, providing a clear visual representation of the peak data associated with the 'sample 1' category in the dataset.
