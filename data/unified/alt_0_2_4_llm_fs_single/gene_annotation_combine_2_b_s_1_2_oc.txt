The visualization consists of two horizontally arranged linear genomic tracks, each representing a gene annotation track for chromosome 3, spanning the positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. 

The left track, titled "IGV," contains overlays of text and shapes indicating gene and strand information. Gene names are marked in navy text, with rectangular shapes for gene bodies and triangle patterns for strand direction, with navy and white colors respectively. This track is stratified by strand type displayed in rows.

The right track similarly displays genes as text with exons, introns, and full gene bodies highlighted. Genes are marked in black text, exons in pink, introns in light blue, and gene bodies in gray, with a silver stroke. Both tracks have nominal strand domains that are visually encoded and include data from a BED file format, suitable for detailed genomic analysis.
