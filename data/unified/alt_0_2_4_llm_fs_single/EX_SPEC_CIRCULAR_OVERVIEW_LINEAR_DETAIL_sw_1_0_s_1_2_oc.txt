The visualization features a circular layout at the top, stacked with a circular bar chart and a link chart. The circular bar chart displays genomic data across chromosomes using colored bars for different samples, with intervals on the x-axis and expression levels on the y-axis. Categories are represented by colors, and interactive brushes link to two linear bar charts below. The link chart showcases structural variations with connections colored by variation type, such as deletions or inversions.

Below, two linear bar charts are horizontally arranged, depicting detailed genomic data for chromosomes 5 and 16. These charts use color to denote sample categories, with expression levels shown on the y-axis. Backgrounds are color-coded as blue and red, corresponding to the circular chart's brushes for enhanced data linking and interactivity.
