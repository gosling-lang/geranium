The visualization displays a linear arrangement of genomic data relating to chromosome 1 from the genome assembly hg38. It includes five tracks: an ideogram, a strand annotation track, two copy number variant (CNV) tracks, and a structural variant (SV) track. The ideogram shows stained bands using a range of colors representing different genomic features. The strand annotation track uses blue and orange triangles to indicate gene directions on different strands. Two CNV tracks display genomic range data using blue rectangles, indicating gain and loss in tumor samples. The SV track connects genomic positions with lines colored by SV class, such as tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions.
