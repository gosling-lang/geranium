The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view, arranged vertically. At the top, the circular view features an ideogram of the human genome (hg19) with tracks for genomic data visualization. Key tracks include 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' indicated in blue and orange rectangles, respectively. A set of curved links within the circle represents structural variations such as 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion,' differentiated by color.

Below, the linear view focuses on chromosome 1 with a detailed genomic ideogram. Annotations include a 'Putative Driver' text track and a 'Point Mutation' scatterplot with color-coded mutation subtypes. Additional tracks cover insertions, deletions, and copy number variants, depicted in rectangles. The combination of circular and linear layouts, linked by a blue brush on the circular ideogram, offers an integrative genomic data exploration.
