The visualization comprises a circular ideogram and a linear genomic track, linked via an interactive blue brush. The circular diagram depicts the entire hg19 genome, highlighting regions of Gain and Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) with blue and orange annotations, respectively. A text track titled 'Putative Driver' is included, displaying gene annotations. Structural variant connections are color-coded by categories such as 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' and 'Inversion.'

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and presents multiple tracks: an ideogram with bands, a gene annotation track with exons and labels, and tracks for point mutations (VCF data, color-coded by mutation subtype), copy number variants, insertions, and deletions. The copy number variants are shown with gray rectangles, while insertions and deletions are differentiated by color. This dual representation offers a comprehensive genome-wide and chromosome-specific analysis of structural and mutation data.
