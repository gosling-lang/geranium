Here's a detailed description for the provided visualization specification:

---

The visualization is a linear, multi-row scatter plot that presents genomic data across four categories, depicted as 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The x-axis represents the genomic positions along chromosome 1, ranging from 1 to 3,000,500, marked at the top. The y-axis encodes quantitative measures of 'peak' values. 

Each sample is displayed in a distinct row, with points marked along the x-axis corresponding to genomic positions. The size of each point indicates the magnitude of the peak value. Points are colored distinctly: 'sample 1' is blue, 'sample 2' is orange, 'sample 3' is green, and 'sample 4' is red. Hovering over points displays a tooltip with genomic start and end positions, peak values formatted to two decimal places, and the sample category.

The arrangement is vertical, with a center radius of 0.8, providing an aesthetic structure. The plot spans a width of 420 units and a height of 160 units, maintaining a semi-transparency with an opacity value of 0.5 for a clean, overlaid visualization effect. This plot is configured to be interactive, allowing for dynamic engagement and exploration of the data set.

The data visualized is sourced from a multivec file accessible at a specified URL, detailing the 'peak' measurements which are dynamically
