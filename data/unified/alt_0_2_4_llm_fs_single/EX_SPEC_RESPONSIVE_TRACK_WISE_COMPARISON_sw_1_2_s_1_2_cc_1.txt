Two sets of linear genomic tracks display information from chromosomes 12 and 8. Each track set includes a genomic range annotation track depicting gene structures and multiple bar charts displaying peak values for samples in vectors. Gene names are shown with text, and exons are represented by rectangles. On chromosome 12, charts for three samples show peak values in pink, while on chromosome 8, sample data is in blue and purple. The gene annotations include directional triangles for gene strand information, overlays for different structural components, and are styled against a light gray background. The visualization utilizes a genomic-focused approach with clear stratification by sample and gene annotations visible across defined chromosome intervals.
