A linear visualization consists of two main sections showcasing genomic data linked by a brush for interactive zooming. The upper section features two bar charts: "Gap", displaying genomic position gaps as sky blue bars, and "Conservation", illustrating conservation scores in a color gradient ranging from yellow to orange. Below, a multi-color rectilinear chart stratifies genomic sequences into rows by amino acid bases labeled with distinct colors. Another overlaid section presents more detailed visual information in a reduced scale, incorporating the same layered tracks: conservation and gap bars, along with genomic sequences visualized in colorful rectangles.
