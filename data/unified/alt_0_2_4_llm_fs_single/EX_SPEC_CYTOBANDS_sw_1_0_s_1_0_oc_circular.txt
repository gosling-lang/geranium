A circular visualization displays genomic data for chromosomes 1 to 5 in a parallel layout. Each chromosome is represented by two concentric tracks. The outer track uses an "area" mark to show peaks in quantitative data, differentiated by categories "sample 1" to "sample 4" using distinct colors. The inner track is an ideogram that uses text and shapes to represent cytogenetic bands, characterized by varying densities and stains. Rectangles encode band density with shades ranging from white to black, while gvar regions are purple. The acen regions are marked with maroon triangles at both ends. The overall structure allows for a comprehensive comparison across chromosomal intervals.
