A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec data file, displaying the chromosome 1 region from position 1 to 3,000,500. It features two samples labeled 'sample 1' and 'sample 2', represented by different colorsâ€”blue and orange, respectively. The bars encode the minimum ('peak_min') and maximum ('peak_max') expression values on the y-axis, stratified by rows corresponding to the categories. The plot includes genomic intervals on the x-axis and is designed with black strokes and 0.2 stroke width for clarity. The visualization is interactive, offering tooltips with details such as position, min and max values, and sample information.
