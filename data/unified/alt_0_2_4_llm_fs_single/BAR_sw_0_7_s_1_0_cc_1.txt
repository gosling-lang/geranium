The visualization is a linear bar chart representing genomic data using a multivec file. It spans across the entire genome of hg38, with specific focus on certain chromosomes shown on the x-axis. The y-axis encodes 'peak' values in a quantitative manner. Each bar's height corresponds to expression levels, with a bin size of 5. The bars are uniformly colored in sky blue. The chart is titled "Basic Marks: bar" and includes a subtitle "Tutorial Examples."
