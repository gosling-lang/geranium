In a linear layout on the hg38 assembly, two tracks illustrate multivec data, focusing on chromosome 2. The top track is a line chart displaying genomic positions on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis, color-coded by categories 'sample 1,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' The bottom track is an area chart with a similar genomic focus, showcasing 'sample 1' and 'sample 2' in distinct colors. Both tracks emphasize data stratification by rows and feature a linkingId for interactive linking.
