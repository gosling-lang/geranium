The visualization is a circular representation with a vertical arrangement, focusing on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. It consists of two main tracks. The left track is a circular heat map displaying genomic intervals along the x-axis, where expression values are encoded using color intensity. The chart is stratified by rows for different categories of samples. The right track is a circular bar chart showing genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values as bars on the y-axis. The chart is also stratified by sample categories, indicated by the color of the bars.
