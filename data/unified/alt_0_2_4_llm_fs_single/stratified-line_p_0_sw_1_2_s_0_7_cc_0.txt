The visualization is a multi-sample line and scatter plot chart in a linear layout. It covers chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500, displaying genomic positions on the x-axis and expression levels on the y-axis. The chart is divided into four rows, each representing a different sample ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'), with lines and points color-coded in blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. Points vary in size, indicating their expression value size. The interactive legend is enabled, allowing users to hover over elements for detailed genomic and expression data. The arrangement facilitates comparative analysis across different samples.
