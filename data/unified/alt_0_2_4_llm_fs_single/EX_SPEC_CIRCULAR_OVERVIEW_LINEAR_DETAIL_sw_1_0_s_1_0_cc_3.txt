The visualization includes a circular layout with multivec data represented by colored bars, stratified by sample categories. Genomic intervals are on the x-axis, and the expression values are on the y-axis. Two bar charts for chromosomes 5 and 16 are linked via interactive brushes, allowing focused exploration. The inner connections represent genomic interactions with stroke colors indicating different categories like deletion or inversion. The circular charts create an overview while the linear views provide detailed genomic insights for specified chromosome regions.
