The visualization is a linear genomic layout displaying data for chromosomes 1 to 5, with each chromosome presented in a separate track. Each track consists of an area chart and an overlaid ideogram. The area charts visualize multivec data, displaying peaks encoded by position on the genomic x-axis and intensity on the y-axis, across four sample categories represented with distinct colors. The ideograms display cytogenetic bands, showing genomic intervals with colors indicating different density categories. The bands are labeled with text, and distinct features such as centromeres are marked with maroon triangles. This serial arrangement provides a comprehensive view of chromosomal data, allowing for comparison of quantitative genomic features across multiple chromosomes.
