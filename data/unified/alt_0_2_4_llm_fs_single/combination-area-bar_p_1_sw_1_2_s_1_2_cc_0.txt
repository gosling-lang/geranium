A visualization consisting of two linear tracks arranged vertically, representing genomic data on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a multi-row bar chart displaying "peak" values for four samples. Each bar's height is determined by the minimum and maximum peak values, with rows and colors representing different samples: blue, orange, green, and red. The bottom track features an area chart for the same samples, with area height corresponding to the peak value. In both tracks, the x-axis represents genomic positions, and charts are stratified by sample categories, with legends displayed for easy identification. The visualization uses multivec data, assisting in genomic feature analysis across multiple samples.
