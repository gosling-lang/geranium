The visualization consists of a circular and a linear genome view linked by an interactive brush. The circular view displays the entire genome, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. The circular layout includes five tracks: an ideogram, a point annotation, two range annotations titled "Gain" (blue rectangles) and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" (orange rectangles), and a line-connection track showing structural variations. Categories like 'Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion' are represented by different connection colors. The linear layout includes additional tracks: a gene annotation, a scatterplot titled "Point Mutation", and two more range annotations. The scatterplot displays mutation points colored by subtype. A VCF file visualizes 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' rows with yellow and green rectangles. The "Copy Number Variants" track shows another CSV file with quantities represented by gray bars.
