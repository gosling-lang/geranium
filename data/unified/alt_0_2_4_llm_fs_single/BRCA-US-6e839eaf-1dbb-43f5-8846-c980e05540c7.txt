The visualization is composed of a circular view and a linear view in a vertical arrangement, connected through a blue interactive brush. The circular view presents the entire genome of hg19, incorporating five tracks: an ideogram, a text annotation track titled 'Putative Driver', two range annotation tracks labeled 'Gain' (blue rectangles) and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' (orange rectangles), and a line-connection track that shows structural variations (SVs) via lines of various colors. These lines denote categories such as 'Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and different types of 'Inversion'.

The linear view represents chromosome 1 and includes more detailed tracks compared to the circular view. It contains an ideogram, text annotations, a scatterplot labeled 'Point Mutation', and two additional range annotation tracks. The scatterplot visualizes mutations from a VCF file, with points colored by subtype and positioned according to the logarithmic distance to the previous mutation. The range track shows insertions and deletions in green and yellow rectangles, respectively. The final track, titled 'Copy Number Variants', uses gray bars to represent quantitative data on copy number variation, with heights corresponding to total copy numbers.

Overall, this visualization effectively combines genomic data from multiple datasets, allowing for the analysis of structural variations, point mutations, and copy number variations across the genome.
