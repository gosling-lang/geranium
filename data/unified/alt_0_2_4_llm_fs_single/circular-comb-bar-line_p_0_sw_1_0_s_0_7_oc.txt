A circular visualization displays genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The left chart is a circular bar chart, showing genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis with bars. Colors represent different categories: 'sample 1' through 'sample 4.' The right chart combines a circular line chart and scatter plot. It also uses genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, with lines and point sizes indicating expression levels. The chart is organized by rows and colors to distinguish the categories.
