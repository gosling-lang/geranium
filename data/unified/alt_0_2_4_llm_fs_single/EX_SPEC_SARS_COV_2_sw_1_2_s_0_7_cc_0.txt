A comprehensive linear visualization of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, spanning 29,903 bases, is presented. The layout consists of multiple views aligned vertically, focusing on different genomic features. The topmost track displays the NC_045512.2 genome with gene annotations, highlighted in pink rectangles and purple text, and includes an interactive brush for linking to detailed views below. The "S Protein Annotation" track categorizes protein regions such as the receptor-binding domain and heptad repeats, represented in various colors, complete with related black text annotations. Below, a detailed track of NC_045512.2 genes is shown again, this time with navy blue rectangles and white text. The sequence track illustrates base counts as colored bars for "A", "T", "G", and "C", each represented by a unique color, with corresponding textual annotations displayed in white. At the bottom, the "TRS-L-Dependent Recombination Events" track shows curved links illustrating recombination events across genomic regions, using a consistent blue hue. The entire visualization is a rich resource for exploring SARS-CoV-2 genetic structure, supported by data from WashU Virus Genome Browser, NCBI, and GISAID.
