The visualization is a linear bar chart depicting genomic data from a multivec file for the hg38 assembly. It displays genomic intervals on the x-axis and quantitative expression values on the y-axis. Bars are colored pink with a fixed size. The chart is titled "Basic Marks: bar" and is part of the "Tutorial Examples" series. The data is segmented into position and peak fields from a single category, "sample 1," with binning at an interval of five units. The layout is configured to allow horizontal interaction and zoom capabilities, with clear genomic annotations on the horizontal axis.
