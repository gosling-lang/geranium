A complex visualization featuring a circular ideogram and a linear view with several tracks illustrates genomic data for the hg19 assembly. The circular ideogram, titled "Ideogram," displays genomic intervals with category-indicating rectangle colors. It includes a blue interactive brush linking to a linear view of chromosome 1. Circular tracks include text annotations for "Putative Driver," range annotations titled "Gain" (in sky blue) and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" (in dark orange), and connection lines depicting structural variants like translocations and duplications, marked with distinct colors. The linear view displays an ideogram, text annotation tracks, and several genomic data tracks: a scatterplot titled "Point Mutation" with colored points indicating mutation subtypes, a two-row annotation track showing "Insertion" and "Deletion" in yellow and green, respectively, and another track for "Copy Number Variants" featuring gray rectangles. The visualization integrates interactive elements and diverse data types, providing a comprehensive view of genomic variations.
