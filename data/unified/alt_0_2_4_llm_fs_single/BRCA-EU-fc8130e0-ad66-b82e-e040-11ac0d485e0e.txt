A circular and linear genomic visualization showing the hg19 assembly, featuring an interactive ideogram and data tracks. The circular view includes tracks for genomic annotations such as gains in sky blue and losses of heterozygosity (LOH) in dark orange, with connections indicating structural variations like translocations and duplications. The linear view details chromosome 1, with tracks for putative driver genes, point mutations, and copy number variants. Tracks also include annotations for insertions and deletions, with respective categorizations via colors and shapes, providing an informative overview of genomic features and variations.
