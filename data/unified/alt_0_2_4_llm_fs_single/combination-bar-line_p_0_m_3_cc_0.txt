A genomic visualization comprising two main tracks in a linear layout presents data from chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track features a line chart where 'position' is mapped along the x-axis and 'peak' values along the y-axis, with lines color-coded for categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4.' The color palette includes shades of blue, orange, green, and red. The bottom track integrates an overlay of area and point marks. Each row corresponds to a specific sample category, with areas colored similar to the line chart. Points' sizes correspond to peak values, creating a visual stratification within each sample category. Overall, the chart is interactive, with tooltips providing information on genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample names. The assembly reference is hg38, and the visualization assists in comparing genomic feature distributions across different samples within the specified interval.
