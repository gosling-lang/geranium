The visualization consists of three bar charts displayed in a linear arrangement. Each chart represents genomic intervals, focusing on chromatographic regions of chromosomes 12 and 9, from positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. Data fields, named 'peak,' drive the y-axis quantitative values. The first and second bar charts share a pink color scheme, reflecting data from chromosome 12, while the last chart uses a sky-blue hue for chromosome 9. Charts accommodate responsive width adjustments and dynamic linkage through a unique linking ID, facilitating a cohesive visual analysis across genomic domains.
