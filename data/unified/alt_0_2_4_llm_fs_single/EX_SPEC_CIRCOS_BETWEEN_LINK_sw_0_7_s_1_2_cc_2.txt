The circular visualization titled "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements" presents genomic data in a stack-aligned layout. It includes four tracks: a green bar chart representing expression values, two ideograms illustrating genomic intervals in various colors depending on categories, and a connection track with links depicted in light gray and black, distinguishing different chromosome links. The data uses a multivec format for peak values and CSV files for genomic ranges, structured in a static, circular format suitable for highlighting genomic relationships and data distribution across the genome, centered on assembly hg38.
