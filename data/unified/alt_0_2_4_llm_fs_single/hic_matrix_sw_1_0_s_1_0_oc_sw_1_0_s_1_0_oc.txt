A heat map with a linear layout visualizes genomic interactions using a matrix file, covering the genome from base pair 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 of the hg38 assembly. The genomic positions are shown on both the x-axis and y-axis, with intervals marked on each. The intensity of color represents quantitative values, with darker shades indicating higher values. The heat map is rendered using grey tones, and the view dimensions are 600x600 pixels.
