A linear layout visualization of genomic data displays two tracks vertically. The top track features a scatter plot marking genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Each point's size represents the expression level, and colors are used to distinguish between four samples. The bottom track, an area chart, similarly represents genomic positions on the x-axis and is stratified into four rows for each sample, with distinctive colors. Both tracks illustrate a portion of chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. The visualization employs an hg38 assembly and includes interactive tooltips showing start and end positions, peak values, and sample information.
