The visualization consists of eight tracks in a vertical linear layout, visualizing genomic data across chromosomes 12 and 8. 

1. **Genomic Range Annotation with Text**: This track displays gene annotations for chromosome 12 between 10,140,000 and 10,210,000. Genes are depicted with directional arrows (triangles and rules) and text labels, colored in green.

2. **Bar Charts for Sample Data on Chromosome 12**: 
   - **Sample 1**: Features a green bar chart with peaks indicating quantitative data values.
   - **Sample 2**: A pink bar chart represents similar data.
   - **Sample 3**: Another set of pink bars is shown.

3. **Bar Charts for Sample Data on Chromosome 8**:
   - **Sample 1**: Displays a purple bar chart with data peaks.
   - **Sample 2**: A continued purple bar chart for visual comparative analysis.
   - **Sample 3**: Features a sky-blue bar chart.

4. **Genomic Range Annotation for Chromosome 8**: Presents gene annotations similar to chromosome 12, with green visual elements indicating gene positions and directions, spanning 127,734,000 to 127,744,000.

Each track carefully encodes genomic position data along the x-axis and expression data along the y-axis where applicable. The visualization employs color coding and axis-free placement to differentiate data across samples and genetic contexts
