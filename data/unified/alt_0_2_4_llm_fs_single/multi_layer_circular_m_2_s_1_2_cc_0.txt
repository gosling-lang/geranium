A circular area chart visualizes a multivec file across chromosome 12, between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart is composed of several rows, each representing a sample, including 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 6', 'sample 7', and 'sample 8'. Each row is depicted in unique colors such as blue, orange, green, and red. The data points are encoded as genomic regions along the x-axis and quantitative peak values along the y-axis. The circular layout provides a compact overview, effectively showcasing variations across different samples within the specified genomic interval.
