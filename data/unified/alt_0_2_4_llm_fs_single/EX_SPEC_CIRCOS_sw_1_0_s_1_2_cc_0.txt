The visualization is a circular layout known as a Circos plot, featuring three layered tracks that represent genomic data. The outermost track is a bar chart showing quantitative genomic data, with bars colored in pink to represent expression levels along the genomic positions on the x-axis. The middle layer is an ideogram track, using a color-coded system to depict different chromosome categories across the genome. The innermost layer features a series of connection lines in various colors, representing genomic links and segmental duplications. These connections are differentiated by color, with lines appearing in orange, blue, and other hues based on categorical values. This Circos plot effectively visualizes complex genomic interactions and structures within the human genome assembly hg38.
