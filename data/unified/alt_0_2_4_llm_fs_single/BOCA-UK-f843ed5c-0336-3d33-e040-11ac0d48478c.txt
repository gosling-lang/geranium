A visualization containing two main views: a circular and a linear view, linked by an interactive blue brush. The circular view represents the entire genome using a circular layout, featuring multiple tracks like an ideogram, a point annotation track labeled 'Putative Driver', and range annotation tracks. 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' are demonstrated with blue and red rectangles, respectively. The line-connection track visualizes chromosomal interactions with various color-coded lines based on 'svclass' categories, including 'Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', 'Duplication', and 'Inversion'. The linear view represents chromosome 1 and includes similar tracks, with additional features. It contains a gene annotation track and a scatterplot 'Point Mutation' based on VCF data, where point positioning reflects mutation distances, and colors represent mutation types categorized by 'SUBTYPE'. The range annotation visualizations include 'Insertion' and 'Deletion', depicted in green and yellow. Lastly, 'Copy Number Variants' are shown with bars representing 'total_cn' in a neutral gray.
