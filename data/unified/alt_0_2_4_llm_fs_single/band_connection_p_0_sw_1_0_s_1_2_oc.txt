A linear visualization of chromosome 1 displays genomic intervals between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000, using data from a CSV file. This visualization includes seven individual tracks: four tracks show rectangles representing regions, while three tracks depict connections between genomic intervals. All visual elements are colored in green with a light opacity. Rectangles and connecting lines use strokes with a width of 0.8 to outline the genomic positions. The visualization is designed for chromosome assembly hg38, with static elements allowing for detailed examination of these specified genomic regions.
