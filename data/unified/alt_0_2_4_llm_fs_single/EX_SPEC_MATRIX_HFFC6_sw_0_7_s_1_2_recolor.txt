A horizontal matrix visualization compares Micro-C and Hi-C data for HFFc6 cells, focusing on chromosome 7 from position 77,700,000 to 81,000,000. It consists of several bar charts and matrix tracks. The bar charts display various genomic data: H3K4me3 in purple, ATAC in dark green, and CTCF in orange, with additional annotation tracks for elements like gene direction indicated by pink and green triangles. The matrices encode expression values using color intensity, highlighting interaction patterns within the specified genomic region. The visualization is styled with light gray background and no visible outlines.
