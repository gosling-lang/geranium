A circular heatmap visualizes a multivec file within chromosome 1 between 1 and 3,000,500. The layout is stratified by four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The intensity of the color in the heatmap represents quantitative 'peak' values, using a 'hot' color scheme. The title of the visualization is "Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts" with the subtitle "Heatmap".
