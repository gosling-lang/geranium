The visualization consists of three connected bar charts arranged horizontally, each depicting different chromosome regions. The charts utilize data from a multivec file, with each track focusing on specific genomic intervals. The first bar chart represents chromosome 12, spanning 5,000,000 to 15,000,000, colored in navy blue. The second chart, covering similar intervals in chromosome 9, is colored in orange. The third chart returns to chromosome 12, maintaining the same interval, but uses a dark yellow color. Each chart displays expression values on the y-axis, with genomic positions on the x-axis, and features consistent styling with white strokes and a stroke width of 0.5. The visualization employs a responsive design, adapting vertically when the screen width is less than 1200 pixels.
