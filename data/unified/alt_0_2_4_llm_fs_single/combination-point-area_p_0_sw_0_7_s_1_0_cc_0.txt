A linear visualization with two vertically arranged tracks illustrates multivec data for chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The top track is a scatter plot where genomic positions are shown on the x-axis, and expression peaks are represented by points varying in size and color according to quantitative and categorical data, respectively. Categories labeled as 'sample 1' through 'sample 4' include blue, orange, green, and red points. The bottom track is an area chart stratified by the same categories, with colors corresponding to the scatter plot. Each area represents expression data along the genomic interval. The layout allows for interactive examination of genomic data with a focus on quantitative peaks.
