A circular line chart visualizes a multivec dataset, representing expression data across chromosome 12 from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000 base pairs. The chart is stratified by rows corresponding to 16 samples, excluding 'sample -.' Lines of different colors depict each sample's data, with color coding specified in the spec. Peak values are shown on the y-axis. Multiple transparency levels and y-axis domains are applied to refine the visualization. The visualization references "Graphical perception of Multiple Time Series" by Javed et al., TVCG 2010.
