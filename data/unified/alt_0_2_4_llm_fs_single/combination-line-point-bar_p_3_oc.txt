The visualization consists of three stacked tracks in a vertical linear layout. Each track visualizes genomic data along the x-axis representing chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500.

1. **Top Track**: A scatter plot displays genomic positions on the x-axis with expression values shown as points on the y-axis. The points are stratified by rows for categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'. Each category is represented by different colors, with point size reflecting the expression's magnitude.

2. **Middle Track**: This is a bar chart where genomic intervals on the x-axis correspond to 'start' and 'end' positions. Bars represent expression values on the y-axis, with ranges from 'peak_min' to 'peak_max'. The chart is stratified by category, reflecting color variations for samples '1' to '4'.

3. **Bottom Track**: An overlay of a line chart and scatter plot. Genomic positions are on the x-axis, while expression values are shown via lines and points on the y-axis. The height of points represents their size. Categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4' are shown in different colors for both lines and points.

Each track utilizes tooltip information, detailing genomic start and end positions, expression value, and sample category. The opacity of the points is set to 0.5, enhancing visibility of overlapping data.
