A visualization featuring a circular and a linear view represents genomic data from the hg19 assembly. The circular ideogram displays the entire genome, with a blue brush highlighting a region corresponding to chromosome 1's linear view. Within the circular layout, five tracks include an ideogram, text annotations for putative drivers, and two genomic range annotations titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)." These regions are marked with blue and orange rectangles, respectively. Additionally, the circular track shows gray connections across genomes.

The linear view emphasizes chromosome 1, featuring several tracks: an ideogram, a "Putative Driver" text track, a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation," with points indicating distances between mutations, and colored based on the "SUBTYPE" field. This view also presents two range annotations for "Insertion" and "Deletion" with colored rectangles, and another track titled "Copy Number Variants" showing numerical data via bar heights. A final track displays structural variations, with color-coded connections for categories such as "Gain," "LOH," "Translocation," "Duplication," "Deletion," and "Inversions."
