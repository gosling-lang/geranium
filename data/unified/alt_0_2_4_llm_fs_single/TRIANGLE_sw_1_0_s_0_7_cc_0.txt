The visualization is a linear genomic annotation track titled "Basic Marks: Triangles," laid out horizontally. It uses the hg38 assembly to display genes annotated with right and left triangles. The chart is organized by strand, with "+" strands represented by right blue triangles and "â€“" strands by left orange triangles. The x-axis denotes genomic positions, with chromosome labels aligned at the top. The chart is static with zoom limits allowing for detailed examination. The subtitle reads "Tutorial Examples," and each triangle represents gene positions along chromosomes, enabling a straightforward comparison of genomic locations.
