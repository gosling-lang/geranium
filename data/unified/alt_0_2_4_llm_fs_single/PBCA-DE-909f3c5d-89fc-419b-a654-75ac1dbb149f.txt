A visualization featuring a circular and a linear view, integrated to explore genomic data. The circular view displays an ideogram and multiple tracks, including a point annotation and genomic range annotations for 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH).' The ideogram uses color-coded rectangles to represent different chromosome regions. Overlaid connections in the circular track illustrate structural variations like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication' using distinct color strokes. Interactive elements such as a blue brush link the circular with the linear view, focusing on chromosome 1. The linear view, divided into nine tracks, presents detailed genomic features. It includes a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation,' where dots represent mutation distances, color-coded by 'SUBTYPE.' Additional tracks depict gene annotations, indel variations with colors for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion,' and a 'Copy Number Variants' track showing quantitative data in grey shades. This visualization offers a comprehensive overview of chromosomal aberrations and genetic variations, facilitating data-driven insights into genomic patterns.
