This visualization presents a comprehensive genomic overview using both circular and linear layouts, depicting data from the hg19 assembly. The circular view, enriched with a blue interactive brush, features a top ideogram and multiple annotation tracks. These highlight copy number variations like 'Gain' (light blue) and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' (orange), with linkages between genomic regions shown as connections, color-coded by structural variations such as 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.'

In the linear view, chromosome 1 is detailed through various tracks: a putative driver track, gene annotations, point mutations, and copy number comparisons. Each mutation type, like 'Insertion' or 'Deletion,' is vividly represented to emphasize differences. The scatter plot further illustrates point mutations, with color distinctions based on mutation subtypes (e.g., C>A, T>G). This dual presentation effectively integrates connection data, utilizing genomic intervals and detailed tracks to enhance the analysis of genetic modifications and structural variations.
