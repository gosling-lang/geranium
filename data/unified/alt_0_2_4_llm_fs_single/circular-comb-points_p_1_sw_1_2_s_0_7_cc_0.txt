A pair of circular scatter plots, arranged vertically, visualizes multivec data for chromosome 1 across a genomic interval of 1 to 3,000,500. The left plot displays genomic positions as points colored by their respective samples: 'sample 1' in blue, 'sample 2' in orange, 'sample 3' in green, and 'sample 4' in red. Each point's size corresponds to the 'peak' value. The right plot stratifies data into rows per sample, maintaining the same color scheme. The opacity of points is set to 0.5, enhancing visibility. The x-axis denotes genomic positions, and the y-axis encodes quantitative 'peak' values. Both plots include interactive tooltips providing detailed genomic positions, peak values, and sample categorizations.
