The visualization is an area chart in a linear layout, showcasing multivec data for chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500. The chart contains four stratified rows labeled 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4,' displayed in blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis indicates quantitative expression values. The chart includes an interactive legend for category identification, showing a white stroke between areas for distinction. Tooltips provide information on genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample classifications.
