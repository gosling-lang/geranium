A parallel layout visualization displays chromosome data using linear views for chromosomes 1 to 5, utilizing a multivec file. Each chromosomal region is illustrated with two tracks: an area chart and an ideogram overlay.

The area charts visualize expression peaks across genomic positions, color-coded by categories such as 'sample 1' to 'sample 4', using distinct colors for each. The y-axis represents quantitative measures of expression peaks, while the x-axis shows genomic positions.

The ideograms depict genomic intervals with various bands marked by rectangles and triangles. They use different shades of gray to black to represent varying densities, while specific stains are highlighted with distinct colors: purple for 'gvar', and maroon for acentromere regions, marked with triangles. Text annotations represent band identifiers along the chromosomes.

This arrangement allows detailed comparative visualization across selected chromosomal regions, highlighting both structural genomic features and quantitative expression data. The use of rich color schemes and interactive elements enhances the analysis of genomic data distribution.
