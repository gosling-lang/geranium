A circular heatmap visualizes a multivec file in a circular layout, representing chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The data is stratified into four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each category is laid out in rows, with the rows displaying color intensity to indicate expression values. The center radius of the circular layout is 0.5. The color scale ranges from light yellow to dark red, corresponding to low to high expression values, respectively. The chart includes a tooltip displaying genomic start and end positions, as well as quantitative peak values for each sample. The visualization is titled "Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts" with a subtitle "Heatmap".
