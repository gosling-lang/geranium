A detailed visualization includes two views: a circular and a linear layout. The circular layout provides an overarching view of the entire hg19 genome and features tracks such as an ideogram, a text annotation track titled 'Putative Driver,' and tracks for range annotations including 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH).' These tracks use colors like sky blue and dark orange to highlight genomic regions.

Within the circular layout, a link track connects various genomic positions, revealing structural variations including Translocation and Duplication. The genomic data is further detailed in the linear layout, which focuses on chromosome 1 and includes tracks for point mutations, insertions, deletions, and copy number variations. The point mutation track visualizes VCF data with colored points, indicating different mutation subtypes such as C>A and T>G.

An interactive brush within the circular ideogram permits focus adjustments of the linear view. The visualization, combining BAM and CSV files, not only shows intricate genomic interactions but also employs smooth paths and layer overlays, providing an in-depth and interactive examination of genomic variations.
