The visualization consists of three horizontally aligned bar charts showcasing data from a multivec file. Each chart focuses on genomic intervals, with two sections displaying data for chromosome 12, spanning from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000, and one showing chromosome 9 within the same interval. The data, representing expression peaks, is visualized on the y-axis, while the genomic intervals are displayed on the x-axis.

The first two charts utilize pink bars to represent the data, highlighting expression levels in the specified genomic intervals. The third chart uses purple bars for similar genomic data. Each chart maintains a consistent bar outline in white, with a stroke width of 0.5. The layout is responsive to the width, altering its arrangement based on screen size constraints.

The data source is a multivec file described in the dataset URL, categorized under "sample 1" with a bin size of 8, which aggregates data points to fit within the intervals. The visuals aim to provide a comprehensive comparison of genomic expression across different chromosomes using a clear and color-coded bar representation.
