The visualization displays linear coverage and pileup tracks using BAM data for chromosome 1 between positions 136,750 and 139,450. The top track is a bar chart with silver bars representing the coverage of genomic intervals. The height of the bars indicates the number of aligned reads in those regions. Beneath, a detailed pileup track depicts individual reads using rectangles, stratified by row according to various categories. These categories, such as 'normal read,' 'deletion (+-),' 'inversion (++),' and others, are color-coded in the rectangles, offering insights into structural variations. The visualization carries the title 'Pileup Track Using BAM Data.'
