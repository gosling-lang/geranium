A circular chart displays genomic connections using a CSV file. The visualization focuses on chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. Within this circular layout, arcs connect intervals between 103,900,000 and 104,100,000, with links extending to second intervals on the same chromosome. The connections are colored based on the nominal values of the first genomic interval field. These arcs have a semi-transparent appearance due to an opacity setting of 0.2, and black strokes outline them with a width of 0.5. The static chart offers a clear view of these genomic relationships.
