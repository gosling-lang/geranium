A circular area chart featuring genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500, displayed in a vertical arrangement. The chart uses different colors to represent four samples: blue for 'sample 1', orange for 'sample 2', green for 'sample 3', and red for 'sample 4'. The x-axis shows the genomic position, while the y-axis represents the quantitated expression values. Each sample is stratified into separate rows, enhancing the readability of the color-coded categories. The chart is static with a center radius of 0.5 and includes a white stroke border around each area.
