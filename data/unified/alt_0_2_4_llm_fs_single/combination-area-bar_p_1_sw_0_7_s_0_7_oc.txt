A linear layout visualization displays the genomic data of chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. It consists of two main tracks, each stratified by four samples. The top track is a bar chart representing minimum and maximum expression values with bars colored differently for each sample. The bottom track is an area chart visualizing expression levels across the x-axis, also with distinct colors for each sample. Both tracks allow for tooltips displaying genomic position and expression values, with genomic intervals marked on the x-axis.
