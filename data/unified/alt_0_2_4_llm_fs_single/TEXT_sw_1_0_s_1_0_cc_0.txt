A text chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, covering chromosomes from chr1 to chrX of hg38. The text represents bases A, T, G, and C, displayed in blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The position of each text is determined by genomic intervals, while the height is related to the quantitative 'count' value for each base. The title is 'Basic Marks: Text,' and the subtitle is 'Tutorial Examples.'
