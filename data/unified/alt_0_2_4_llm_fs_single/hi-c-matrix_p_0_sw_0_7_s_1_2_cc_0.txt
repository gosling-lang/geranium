The visualization depicts an overlay of a Hi-C matrix with annotations, covering parts of chromosomes 5 to 10 on a genomic scale. The matrix, shown in a linear arrangement, uses color intensity to encode expression values. Green vertical and purple horizontal lines represent specific genomic positions within the displayed interval. Additional matrix tracks include genomic intervals marked by bars with categorical strokes, and another set visualized through points, where size depicts expression levels. This comprehensive setup highlights intricate genomic interactions, with annotated tracks providing further detail and context. The title, "Hi-C Matrix," situates the viewer in an exploratory visualization environment aimed at understanding genomic data.
