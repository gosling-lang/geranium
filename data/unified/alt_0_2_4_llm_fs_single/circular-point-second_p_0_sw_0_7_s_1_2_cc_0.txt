In a circular layout, a scatter plot visualizes a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500. The scatter plot encodes genomic positions on the circular x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, with point sizes indicating the magnitude of the expression values. Points are color-coded by "sample" categories: Sample 1 (blue), Sample 2 (orange), Sample 3 (green), and Sample 4 (red). The visualization includes a legend and tooltips for detailed data inspection, with an overall opacity of 0.5 to enhance visibility.
