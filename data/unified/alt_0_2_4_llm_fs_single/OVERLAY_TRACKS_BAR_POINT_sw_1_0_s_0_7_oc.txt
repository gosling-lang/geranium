**Description**: 

A linear visualization titled "Example: Overlay Tracks" depicts genomic data from chromosome 3 using overlay tracks. This chart combines bars and points to represent the clinical significance of genetic variations. The x-axis displays genomic intervals with annotations for different significance levels such as "Pathogenic" and "Likely benign." Points are sized uniformly, and bars are outlined, both colored according to their significance: shades of orange represent pathogenic categories, black indicates "Uncertain significance," and green varies for benign categories. The chart is interactive, offering a legend to help distinguish categories based on color. The height of the visualization is adjusted to accommodate all data types and ensure a clear view of variations.
