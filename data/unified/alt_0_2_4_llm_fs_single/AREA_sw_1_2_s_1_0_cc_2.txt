The visualization is a linear area chart displaying multivec data across the entire genome of hg38. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis shows quantitative expression values, both sourced from a data field named 'peak.' A single category named 'sample 1' is utilized in the data, with the area visually encoded in purple. The title of the chart is 'Basic Marks: area,' with a subtitle 'Tutorial Examples.' The chart dimensions are 960 pixels in width and 210 pixels in height, providing a comprehensive view of genomic expression values distributed across chromosomes.
