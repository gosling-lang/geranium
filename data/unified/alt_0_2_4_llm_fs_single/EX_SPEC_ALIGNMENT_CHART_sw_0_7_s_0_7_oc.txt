A series of four charts represents genomic data with varying visualizations. The first chart is a gray bar chart displaying genomic intervals on the x-axis and gap percentages on the y-axis. The second chart shows conservation scores as blue bars, also with genomic intervals on the x-axis and scores on the y-axis. The third chart combines colored rectangles and text, stratified by categories on the y-axis, to depict nucleotide sequences across genomic intervals on the x-axis. The final composite chart overlays rectangles and two bar charts, with each layer providing distinct genomic information over an extended range, enhancing data interpretation through color-coded categories.
