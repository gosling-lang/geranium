A vertical arrangement of genomic data visualization is displayed. The top chart features a multi-line plot, representing samples over the x-axis with chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. Each line corresponds to a different sample ('sample 1' in blue, 'sample 2' in orange, 'sample 3' in green, and 'sample 4' in red), depicting quantitative peak values on the y-axis. The bottom chart is a bar plot with the same genomic range, where the height of the bars indicates peak values, colored by sample categories. The layout facilitates comparison of data trends across samples, providing insights into genomic variations.
