The visualization comprises a circular and a linear view arranged vertically and linked by a blue interactive brush. The circular view displays the entire genome with tracks that include an ideogram and various annotations, such as "Gain" in blue rectangles and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in orange rectangles. The line-connection track highlights genomic position connections differentiated by colors representing categories like 'Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion'. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and showcases tracks for gene annotations, point mutations, and copy number variants. The scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" visualizes VCF data, with point positions indicating distances to prior mutations, and point colors representing mutation subtypes. Rectangles in the range annotation track indicate CNV, colored in grey, while the genomic range annotation track presents insertions and deletions in different colors.
