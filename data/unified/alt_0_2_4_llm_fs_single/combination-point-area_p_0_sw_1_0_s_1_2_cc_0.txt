A linear layout visualization shows genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track features a scatter plot where the genomic position is displayed on the x-axis and peak expression values on the y-axis. The size and color of the points represent quantitative and categorical differences among 'sample 1' to 'sample 4', using a range of colors from blue to red with 50% opacity. The bottom track is an area chart, split by rows for each sample, indicating the distribution of the peak values with white stroked boundaries. Both tracks include interactive tooltips showing start and end genomic positions, peak values, and sample categories.
