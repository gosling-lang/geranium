The visualization named "Visual Linking" utilizes a vertical arrangement featuring interactive brushing. It consists of a circular line chart, a linear area chart, and a detailed scatter plot. The circular chart displays genomic intervals from chromosome 1 on the x-axis with expression values shown as lines on the y-axis, stratified and colored by sample categories. It includes a brush link to the linear chart. The linear area chart, also linked to the circular view, represents genomic data with colored areas. Below, a detailed linear track shows a scatter plot for a specific region of chromosome 1 (160,000,000 to 200,000,000). Each point reflects quantitative expression values symmetrically across samples. This visualization dynamically updates according to the brush position and range, enhancing the interaction between different views.
