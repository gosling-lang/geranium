The visualization is a circular chart with two tracks, designed to represent genomic data from chromosome 1 using the HG38 assembly. The outer track is a circular bar chart, displaying multivec file data. It uses bars to indicate expression levels, color-coded across four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4.' Each sample is assigned a unique color from a diverse palette. The x-axis represents genomic positions, with the y-axis indicating quantitative values of gene expression ('peak').

The inner track features a circular ideogram. It shows the genomic intervals for each section of the chromosome, excluding acentric regions due to a filtering process. The ideogram segments are colored based on different stains found in the cytogenetic banding pattern, aiding in the identification of structural features across the genome.

This comprehensive genomic visualization facilitates the exploration of complex data patterns within a compact circular layout, allowing for simultaneous observation of both individual gene expression and broader chromosomal characteristics.
