The visualization is a circular layout with two distinct tracks showing data from chromosome 1 within genomic intervals. 

### Left Track:
- **Type:** Circular chart with connections.
- **Data Source:** CSV file indicating genomic positions (`s1`, `s2`, `e1`, `e2`) with associated categories.
- **Visual Encoding:** Genomic positions (`s1` to `e1`) on the x-axis with connections representing nominal categories. 
- **Styles:** Lines colored based on categories with black stroke and 0.2 opacity.
- **Dimensions:** Width and height are set to 350 units.
  
### Right Track:
- **Type:** Circular chart with area plots.
- **Data Source:** Multivec file showing genomic `position`, row `sample`, and expression `peak`.
- **Visual Encoding:** x-axis represents genomic position, and y-axis shows expression as an area under each sample. 
- **Categories:** Stratified by four samples, each colored differently with a legend for reference.
- **Tooltip:** Interactive details for start and end positions of genomic data, peaks, and sample names.
- **Styles:** White stroke with a width of 0.5 for area distinction.
- **Dimensions:** Width and height mirror the left track at 350 units.

Overall, this visualization displays genetic sequence connections and expression data across samples, categorized by colors, within a circular genomic context.
