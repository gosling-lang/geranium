This visualization consists of two charts arranged vertically with a linear layout format, displaying genomic data across the interval from 1 to 3,000,500 on chromosome 1. The top chart features an overlay of point and area marks to represent peaks, stratified by rows indicating categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4', each assigned distinct colors such as blue, orange, green, and red. The size of the area mark symbolizes the height of expression values, while the color code enriches categorical differentiation. A detailed tooltip provides insights into genomic positions, peak values, and sample categories. The bottom chart exhibits an area mark-only representation, depicting quantitative peaks with a grid for clarity. Combining these tracks elucidates distinct genomic patterns, aiding in visual analysis.
