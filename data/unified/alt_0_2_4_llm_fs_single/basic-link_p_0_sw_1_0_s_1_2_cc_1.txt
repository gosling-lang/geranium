The visualization titled "Basic Marks: Link" is a linear chart showing genomic connections within chromosome 1. Using a CSV file sourced online, it plots arcs connecting genomic intervals. The genomic data is visualized through arcs, with start and end positions represented along the x-axis. These arcs are styled in light purple, providing a visual representation of genomic links or duplications within the linear layout. The subtitle "Tutorial Examples" indicates its educational purpose. The assembly used is hg38, and the chart has a width of 960 pixels and a height of 246 pixels.
