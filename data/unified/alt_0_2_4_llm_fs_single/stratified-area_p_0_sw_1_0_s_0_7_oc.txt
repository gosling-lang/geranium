The visualization is a linear area chart representing genomic data, focused on chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. It utilizes four stacked rows corresponding to different samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each row displays quantitative peak values plotted against genomic positions. Different colors are used to distinguish the samples, and a white stroke delineates the areas. Tooltips provide additional details such as start and end positions, peak values, and sample names. The layout has a vertical arrangement with a centered radius of 0.8, facilitating a clear comparison across samples.
