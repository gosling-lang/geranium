The visualization consists of a circular ideogram and a linear view, connected by a blue interactive brush. The circular view displays the entire genome, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. The circular view includes tracks for ideogram, text annotations, genomic ranges, and structural variations. The 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' tracks show blue and orange rectangles representing genomic ranges. Connection tracks show lines classified by categories such as 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.' In the linear view, similar tracks are linked to the circular view with additional gene annotations, a scatter plot for point mutations, and range annotations for insertions and deletions. The scatter plot, titled 'Point Mutation,' utilizes VCF data where points are color-coded by mutation subtype. The range annotations track displays rectangles for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' with distinct colors, while the 'Copy Number Variants' track uses gray bars to represent quantitative data.
