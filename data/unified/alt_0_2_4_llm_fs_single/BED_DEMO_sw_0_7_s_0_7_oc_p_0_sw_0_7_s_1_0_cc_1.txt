The visualization consists of four tracks arranged vertically, each representing different BED file specifications on chromosome 1 from 1 to 2,000,000. The first track displays rectangles in sky blue, titled "BED12: All 12 standard fields." The second, titled "BED6: A file with the first 6 BED fields," uses pink rectangles. The third track, "BED6+6: A file with the first 6 BED fields, and 6 custom fields," features purple rectangles. The fourth track, "BED12+1: A file with all 12 standard fields, and a single extra custom field," repeats the pink coloration. All tracks illustrate genomic intervals using rectangular marks, with consistent styling and layout across the linear genome scales.
