The visualization consists of two vertically arranged linear genomic tracks, both focusing on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a heat map representing a multivec file with samples 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'. Each sample is displayed in a separate row, with genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values shown through color intensity. The sequential data is binned, revealing peaks with varying intensities.

Below, the second track is a multi-row bar chart presenting the same samples, where the x-axis shows genomic positions, and the y-axis represents quantitative peak values. Each row corresponds to a sample, with colors distinguishing the samples, aiding in comparison of their expression across the genomic intervals. Tooltips provide genomic start and end positions, quantitative values, and sample names, enhancing interactivity and user insights. The entire assembly is based on hg38.
