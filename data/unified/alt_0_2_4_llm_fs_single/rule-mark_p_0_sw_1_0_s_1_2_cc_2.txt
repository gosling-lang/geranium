**Description:**

This visualization is a multi-layered chart using a linear overlay layout. It features an annotated bar chart with genomic and quantitative data. The bar chart visualizes a multivec data file showing genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. The bars are colored pink and represent 'peak' values within the domain of 0 to 0.003. Overlaying this bar chart are rule-based annotations in the form of horizontal and vertical lines, enhancing the visual narrative with additional data points indicated at genomic positions on the horizontal axis and corresponding quantitative values on the vertical axis. These lines are dashed and colored sky blue, indicating specific references from a separate JSON dataset. The stroke width of the horizontal lines varies based on quantitative values. The chart is titled "Rule Mark," with the subtitle "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines," and utilizes linear genomic coordinates, specifically on the hg38 assembly.
