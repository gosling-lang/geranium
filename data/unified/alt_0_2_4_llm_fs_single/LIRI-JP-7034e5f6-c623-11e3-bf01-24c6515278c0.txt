A circular and linear genome visualization is shown, consisting of multiple tracks visualizing various genomic data for the hg19 assembly. The circular view displays an ideogram of the entire genome with blue and red highlights representing gain and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) respectively, both in the outer rings. Inner layers include a text track for 'Putative Driver' annotations, which mark genomic positions with black text, followed by tracks for genomic segments connection, or structural variants, with lines in varying colors and styles indicating different structural variant categories: "Translocation," "Duplication," "Deletion," and "Inversion."

Below the circular view, a linear view focusing on chromosome 1 displays more detailed information. It includes an ideogram, a text annotation for "Putative Driver," genomic triangles indicating gene orientation, a scatter plot for "Point Mutation" with points colored by mutation subtypes, and two stacked tracks for "Insertion" and "Deletion" events marked by rectangles. Further, a track displays "Copy Number Variants," visualizing quantitative copy number changes as gray bars. Lastly, tracks for "Gain" in blue and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in orange display genomic regions affected by these events. Each track includes genomic coordinates along the x-axis for precise location referencing, and colors are used consistently to differentiate data types.
