A multi-row bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file for chromosome 1, spanning 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. Each of the four samples is represented in a separate row with distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis represents the genomic position, while the y-axis indicates the quantitative peak value. The interactive legend highlights the sample categories. Tooltip information includes start and end positions, peak values, and sample names.
