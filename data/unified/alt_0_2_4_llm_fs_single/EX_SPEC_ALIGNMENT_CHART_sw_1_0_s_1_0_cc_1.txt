The visualization displays genomic alignment data using multiple charts in a vertical linear layout. The first chart, titled "Gap," is a bar chart showing gap values along the genome with sky-blue bars. The second chart, titled "Conservation," uses a bar chart to represent conservation values in yellow, with color encoding on the y-axis. The third chart incorporates rectangles and text, stratified by categories with each row colored differently. Below, an overlay chart combines rectangles showing genomic positions in color-coded categories with two additional bar charts. The illustrated genomic interval spans positions 350 to 396, and further details are provided by interactive elements like brushes to explore specific regions of interest.
