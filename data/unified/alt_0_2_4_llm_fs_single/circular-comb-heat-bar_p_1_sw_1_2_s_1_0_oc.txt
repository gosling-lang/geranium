A multi-track circular visualization displays genomic data from chromosome 1, covering positions from 1 to 3,000,500. The left section features a circular bar chart with genomic positions on the x-axis and expression levels on the y-axis. This chart is stratified into four rows, each corresponding to a category (sample 1, sample 2, sample 3, sample 4), with bars colored differently for each category. The right section shows a circular heat map with genomic intervals on the x-axis, where expression values are represented through color intensity, stratified likewise by categories. The layout is static, utilizing a multivec file for data input.
