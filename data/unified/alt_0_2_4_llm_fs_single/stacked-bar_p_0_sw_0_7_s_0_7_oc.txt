A vertical bar chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The height of each bar encodes quantitative data from the field "peak." The bars are color-coded to represent four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each with a distinct color. The chart provides genomic data on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis, with tooltips showing details such as start and end genomic positions, peak values, and sample names. The layout is linear using the hg38 assembly.
