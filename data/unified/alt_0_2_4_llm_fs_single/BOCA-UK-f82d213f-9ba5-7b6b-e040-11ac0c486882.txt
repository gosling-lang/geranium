The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view arranged vertically, linked by an interactive brush in the circular view. The circular view displays the entire genome, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. 

In the circular view, five tracks are presented: an ideogram, a point annotation track, two range annotation tracks, and a line-connection track. The point annotation track visualizes gene information. The range annotation tracks highlight genomic data, with "Gain" indicated by blue rectangles and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" by orange rectangles. The line-connection track illustrates structural variations, showing connections between genomic positions, colored based on structural variation type, including "Gain," "LOH," "Translocation," "Duplication," "Deletion," and two types of "Inversion."

The linear view mirrors the circular view's elements with added tracks: gene annotation, a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation," and additional range annotation tracks. The scatter plot uses VCF data, representing mutations by distance to the previous mutation, with colors signifying different mutation subtypes. The first range annotation track details "Insertion" and "Deletion" using differently colored rectangles. The second tracks show "Copy Number Variants" with bars representing copy number changes, highlighted in grey.
