The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view arranged vertically, linked by an interactive blue brush in the circular view. The circular view represents the entire genome, focusing on chromosome 1, and includes tracks such as an ideogram, point annotation, range annotation, and line-connection tracks. Notably, the "Gain" range annotation track highlights genomic intervals in blue rectangles, while the "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" track uses orange rectangles. Line-connection tracks display various genomic connections in distinct colors based on the 'svclass' field, including categories like 'Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', and 'Duplication'. 

The linear view replicates the circular view's tracks but introduces additional data representations, including a gene annotation track, a scatterplot visualizing point mutations, and two range annotation tracks depicting insertions and deletions in different colors. This comprehensive layout enables a detailed genomic analysis using CSV and VCF data, focusing on visual clarity and interactivity through customizable colors and tooltips.
