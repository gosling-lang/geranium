The visualization consists of a series of parallel area charts and ideograms for chromosomes 1 to 5, each displaying genomic data from a multivec file. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis displays peak values quantitatively. Areas are color-coded based on 'sample' categories, using a range of colors including blue, orange, and green.

Each area chart is aligned with an ideogram, containing text, rectangles, and triangles, to indicate cytogenetic bands. The colors of the bands vary: black, gray shades, purple rectangles, and maroon triangles mark centromeric regions. This combination of area charts and ideograms provides a comprehensive view of genomic expression and structural details across chromosomes 1 to 5.
