A linear genomic range annotation chart titled "GmGDV" displays gene annotations within chromosome 3, spanning from 52,168,000 to 52,890,000 base pairs. The chart, aligned vertically, uses an overlay to depict multiple tracks and is stratified by strand. Genes are represented with text labels, right triangles for positive strands, left triangles for negative strands, and rectangles for exons. Horizontal rules connect gene annotations. The chart utilizes colors to distinguish strands: blue for positive and orange for negative.
