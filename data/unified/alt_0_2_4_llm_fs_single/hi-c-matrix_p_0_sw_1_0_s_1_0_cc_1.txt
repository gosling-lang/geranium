The visualization titled **"Hi-C Matrix"** is presented in a linear layout, focusing on genomic Hi-C data. It overlays multiple tracks to depict a comprehensive view. This includes a heatmap where color intensity encodes expression values, with the x- and y-axes representing genomic intervals. Additional annotations are given by overlaid green lines showing specific genomic positions on both axes. The heatmap's color encoding follows a 'hot' gradient, accompanied by a legend for interpretation.

Moreover, blue points within the matrix illustrate genomic interactions, where point size varies based on an underlying quantitative value. These points are styled with white strokes for distinction. Overall, this visualization effectively combines a Hi-C heatmap with annotation lines and interaction points, providing a detailed insight into genomic data correlations and structural variations across certain chromosomes between positions 800 million and 1.8 billion. The title and subtitle, "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations," offer context for this complex genomic analysis.
