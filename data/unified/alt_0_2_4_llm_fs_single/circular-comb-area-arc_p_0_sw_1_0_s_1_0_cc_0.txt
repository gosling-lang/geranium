A vertically arranged circular visualization displays genomic data. The left track is an area chart showing the chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. Four nominal categories, 'sample 1' through 'sample 4,' are represented in four colorsâ€”blue, orange, green, and red. The height of the area represents quantitative 'peak' values. The right track is a connection chart within the same genomic interval. The links, colored according to their 's1' values, connect genomic regions, indicating structural relationships.
