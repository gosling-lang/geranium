The visualization is a linear area chart displaying genomic data from the hg38 assembly. It showcases expression values across the genome on the x-axis, with the y-axis representing quantitative values. The data is sourced from a multivec file, focusing on a single category, "sample 1." The visualization is titled "Basic Marks: area" with a subtitle "Tutorial Examples." The chart's area is colored in pink and is defined by quantitative peaks from the data. The layout accommodates a width of 672 pixels and a height of 156 pixels, and the design includes a center radius of 0.3 and a static orientation, ensuring clarity in representing the genomic positions.
