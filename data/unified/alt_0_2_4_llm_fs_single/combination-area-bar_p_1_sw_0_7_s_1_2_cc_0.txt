A vertical arrangement of charts in a linear layout displays genomic data along chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The visualization consists of two main tracks. The top track is a multi-row bar chart, where each row represents a different sample ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'). The height of the bars, colored in blue, orange, green, and red, indicates the range between 'peak_min' and 'peak_max' values. The bottom track is a multi-row area chart showing expression values across the same samples, with the area filled accordingly. These tracks are stratified by rows for categories and are color-coded for clear differentiation. The genomic intervals are aligned on the x-axis, and quantitative data is represented along the y-axis, enhancing the visualization of genomic peaks and their variations across samples.
