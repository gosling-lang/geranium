A circular chart titled 'Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements' visualizes genomic data. It includes four main components: a circular bar chart highlighting expression levels with purple bars, two circular ideograms showing genomic intervals with categories in varying colors, and a circular chart with connections colored in pink. The chart uses hg38 assembly and arranges elements in a stacked, static layout. Chromosome data from both multivec and CSV sources are used to present peaks and ideograms, respectively. Connections are drawn between genomic coordinates, distinguishing links inside and outside chromosome 1.
