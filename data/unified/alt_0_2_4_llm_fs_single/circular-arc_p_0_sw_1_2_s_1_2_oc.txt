A circular visualization in a vertical arrangement displays genomic data. It focuses on chromosome 1 within a specified interval (1 to 3,000,500). The chart includes connections within the genomic regions, where the arcs represent links between start and end positions on the chromosome. Each connection is color-coded nominally based on the 's1' field, allowing differentiation of categories. The transparency of the arcs is set at 0.2, with a black stroke outlining each connection. The static display utilizes a circular layout, showcasing a segment of the genome from 103,900,000 to 104,100,000.
