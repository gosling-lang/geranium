A circular scatter plot visualizes genomic data along chromosome 12 from positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000, reference assembly hg38. Dots are color-coded based on categories from 'sample 1' to 'sample 16,' excluding 'sample -,' mapping data from a multivec source. Peaks represent quantitative 'peak' values, stratified by opacity across rows, with multiple opacity layers for different peak value domains. The plot integrates genomic coordinates for 'start' and 'end,' with a top axis labeled for genomic intervals. This visualization demonstrates a comprehensive radial layout for exploring multi-sample genomic variations, supported by graphical perception principles outlined by Javed et al.
