The image is a Hi-C matrix visualization with annotations, displaying genomic interactions for chromosomes 5 to 10. The layout is linear, oriented horizontally, covering an x-domain from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 base pairs. The chart has overlaid tracks featuring a Hi-C matrix, red vertical lines, blue horizontal lines, bars, and points. The Hi-C matrix shows genomic intervals on both axes with color intensity encoding expression values. Red lines mark specific genomic positions across the x-axis, while blue lines mark positions on the y-axis. Bar tracks show additional genomic data with varying stroke colors, and a point chart displays size-encoded quantitative values with the points colored steel blue with white strokes. The style incorporates dashed lines and a light gray background, emphasizing the structured visualization of the genomic data. The title is "Hi-C Matrix," with a subtitle "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations."
