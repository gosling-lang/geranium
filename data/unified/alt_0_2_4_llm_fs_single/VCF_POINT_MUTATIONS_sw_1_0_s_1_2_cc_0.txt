The visualization is a linear scatter plot displaying point mutations from a VCF file across various chromosomes. The x-axis represents genomic positions annotated by chromosome numbers (chr1, chr2, etc.), and the y-axis quantifies the "DISTPREVLOGE" values. Each point corresponds to a mutation and is color-coded based on the "SUBTYPE" of mutation, including categories such as C>A, C>G, and T>C, each represented by distinct colors. The plot features a top legend for mutation types and an opacity level of 0.9 for the points, styled within a vertical arrangement. The title is "Point mutations from a VCF file."
