The visualization presents a combination of circular and linear layouts to represent genomic data of the hg19 assembly. The circular view acts as an ideogram of the entire genome, showcasing colored bands to indicate different staining patterns and a blue brush to dynamically link views. Inside, a series of concentric tracks display genomic annotations: a text track for putative driver genes, blue rectangles for copy number gains, orange for loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and interconnected lines representing structural variations across the genome. The connections are categorized by color, depicting various structural alterations such as translocations and inversions.

Below, the linear view focuses on chromosome 1, expanding on data seen in the circular view. This includes detailed annotations: gene positions, point mutations with scatter plots indicating mutation density, and two row-shaded tracks for insertions and deletions. Another track visualizes copy number variations as grey bars, while gain and LOH regions are again highlighted in blue and orange, respectively. The entire visualization is styled with light gray outlines and structured to facilitate genomic data exploration through interactive features.
