The visualization is a linear representation of a section of the E. coli genome, specifically between positions 222,000 and 240,000 on the chromosome U00096.3. The chart is titled "GFF3 file" with the subtitle "E. coli genome, colored by gene type." The genome is displayed on the x-axis, and the genes are represented as arrows indicating the direction of transcription, colored based on their biotype, such as protein coding, tRNA, rRNA, ncRNA, pseudogene, and unknown. Positive strand genes are marked with right-pointing triangles and negative strand genes with left-pointing triangles. Gene names are displayed above the gene locations. The visualization uses a GFF3 file for data, with smooth paths enabled for visual clarity.
