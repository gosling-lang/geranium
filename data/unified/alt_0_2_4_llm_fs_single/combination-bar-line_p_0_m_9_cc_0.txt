A vertical arrangement of genomic data tracks in a linear layout displays two types of charts over chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is an area chart showcasing multivec data, colored according to four categories: 'sample 1' (blue), 'sample 2' (orange), 'sample 3' (green), and 'sample 4' (red). It represents genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis. The bottom track features an overlay of a line chart and an area chart, stratified by rows for each sample category, displaying genomic positions on the x-axis with corresponding peak values influencing line and area size. Both tracks include legends and tooltips for interactivity, clarifying genomic positions, peak values, and sample categories.
