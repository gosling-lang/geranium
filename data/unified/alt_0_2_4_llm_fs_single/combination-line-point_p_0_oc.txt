The visualization consists of two linear charts arranged vertically, representing genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The top chart is a combined line and scatter plot displaying genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. It features lines and sized points, stratified by rows into four categories: 'sample 1' to 'sample 4', each depicted in a distinct color. The bottom chart is a scatter plot with similar x and y-axis configurations, where point size signifies expression values. Categories are emphasized with consistent coloring from the top chart. The visualization includes interactive tooltips for detailed exploration, providing genomic position, value, and sample information.
