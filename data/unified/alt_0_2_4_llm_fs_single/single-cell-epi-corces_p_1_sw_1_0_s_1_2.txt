The visualization showcases a single-cell epigenomic analysis using a linear layout with a vertical arrangement. It highlights data from 'Corces et al. 2020' within chromosome 3, spanning positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. The upper section features seven bar charts representing different neuron types (Excitatory, Inhibitory, Dopaminergic, Microglia, Oligodendrocytes, Astrocytes, and OPCs), with expressions shown on the y-axis, each distinguished by unique colors.

A genomic range annotation track titled 'Genes' visualizes gene structures with rectangles and texts, stratified by strand direction. Below, three 'PLAC-seq (H3K4me3)' connection tracks illustrate interactions within specific intervals, with subtle color distinctions. At the bottom, an ideogram of chromosome 3 provides a genomic context, enhanced by a red interactive brush linking to detailed views above. The overall layout uses an hg38 assembly with dynamic interactions enabled via linking IDs.
