The visualization titled "Visual Linking" features multiple interconnected views to explore genomic data. In a vertical arrangement, the primary linear scatter plot displays genomic positions on chromosome 1, ranging from 160,000,000 to 200,000,000, on the x-axis. The y-axis represents quantitative expression values, stratified and colored by four nominal sample categories. Below, two additional views enhance data exploration: a linear area chart and a circular line chart. Both charts incorporate a genome-wide view of chromosome 1, allowing users to select regions interactively using brushes, which are linked across the charts. The area chart illustrates expression data with shaded regions, whereas the circular chart uses lines. Each chart is organized by sample categories, further distinguished by color. The visualization is assembled using hg38 and enables dynamic updates to the detailed view through brush interaction, emphasizing the genome's intricate structural and functional complexity.
