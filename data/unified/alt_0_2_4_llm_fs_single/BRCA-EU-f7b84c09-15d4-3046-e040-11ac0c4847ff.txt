The visualization consists of two main parts: a circular view and a linear view arranged vertically. The views are linked by an interactive brush in the circular ideogram, focusing on chromosome 1 in the linear view. The circular view contains tracks like an ideogram, text annotations for putative drivers, and range annotations for genomic gains and losses. The tracks are color-coded by categories such as Gain (blue) and Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) (orange). The linear view further details chromosome 1 with a series of tracks: a detailed ideogram, rows for annotated genes, scatter plots for point mutations, and range tracks for insertions, deletions, and copy number variations. Connections between genomic positions, marked by lines, display various structural variations like translocations and inversions, distinguished through different colors. The visualization effectively synthesizes genomic data, aiding in interpreting complex genomic relationships across the chromosome.
