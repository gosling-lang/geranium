A circular bar chart represents a multivec file, visualizing genomic data from chromosome 12, between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The layout is composed of multiple concentric layers, each corresponding to a different sample category. There are 16 samples, depicted in distinct colors such as blue, orange, green, red, and purple, allowing differentiation between rows. The expression values are shown on the y-axis, segmented by different opacity levels to represent varying data ranges. This visualization references Javed et al.'s study on the graphical perception of multiple time series.
