A linear layout visualization titled "Single-cell Epigenomic Analysis" from Corces et al. 2020 shows chromosome 3 epigenomic data. The ideogram track with red triangles marks acen regions, and the color intensity represents band density. It includes bar charts illustrating peak activities in different neuron types like excitatory (orange), inhibitory (green), dopaminergic (purple), microglia (sky blue), oligodendrocytes (violet), astrocytes (red), and OPCs (light purple), with genomic features represented in right-aligned light blue and red text and rectangles. PLAC-seq data, depicted in linked lines, shows oligodendrocytes (orange), microglia (blue), and neurons (purple) with low opacity, emphasizing chromatin interactions.
