A circular bar chart visualizes a vector file with genomic positions mapped to expression peaks, using genome assembly hg38. The bars represent the values of the 'peak' field and are displayed in purple, radiating from a circular center. The x-axis is arranged in a circular layout, showing different chromosomes. The chart has a static, stacked alignment and is visually centered with a center radius of 0.3. The purple bars indicate quantitative expression levels along the y-axis.
