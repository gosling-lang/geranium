A linear area chart in vertical arrangement visualizes a multivec file, displaying chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 in the hg38 assembly. The data is stratified into four samples, each represented by a distinct row. The area in each row is color-codedâ€”orange for 'sample 1', green for 'sample 2', blue for 'sample 3', and purple for 'sample 4'. The x-axis shows genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative peak values. A tooltip provides genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample information. The chart has an interactive legend.
