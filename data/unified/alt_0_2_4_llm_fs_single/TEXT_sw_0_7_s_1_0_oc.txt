A text chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, displaying genomic data with categories 'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C'. The position of each text element corresponds to the genomic field 'start' on the x-axis and the quantitative field 'count' on the y-axis. The elements are colored based on their category, with distinct colors for 'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C'. The chart is titled 'Basic Marks: Text' with a subtitle 'Tutorial Examples'.
