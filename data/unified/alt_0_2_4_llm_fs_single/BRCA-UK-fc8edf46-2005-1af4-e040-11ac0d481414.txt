The visualization is composed of a circular ideogram and a linear genomic view, designed to display genomic variations across the human genome assembly hg19. The circular ideogram includes tracks for putative drivers, gains, and losses of heterozygosity (LOH), with colors indicating different categories of genomic variations. A blue interactive brush is featured, linking the circular view to corresponding regions in the linear view.

The linear section showcases detailed tracks for chromosome 1. This includes an ideogram with colored bands representing chromosomal features. The 'Putative Driver' track displays gene annotations, while the 'Point Mutation' track visualizes VCF data with points colored by mutation subtype. Further tracks detail insertions, deletions, copy number variants (CNVs), and structural variations with connections shown between linked genomic positions.

Structural variant tracks feature links of varying colors to denote types like 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion,' with user interactions enabled through clicking and hovering for detailed tooltips. The genomic data is presented in a harmonized fashion with a clear color-coded legend for mutation subtypes and structural variations.
