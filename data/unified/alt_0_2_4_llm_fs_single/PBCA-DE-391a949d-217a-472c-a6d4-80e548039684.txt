A dual-view visualization displays genomic data in both circular and linear formats, linked by an interactive brush. The circular view encompasses the entire genome featuring tracks such as an ideogram, a text-based annotation for "Putative Driver," range annotations titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and connection lines colored by data field categories like 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' and 'Deletion.' The linear view zooms into chromosome 1, with additional tracks. These include a detailed gene annotation track, a scatter plot named "Point Mutation" visualizing VCF files with color-coded mutation types, and range annotation tracks featuring copy number variants and indels. This setup enables detailed exploration and analysis of genomic variations across different data dimensions.
