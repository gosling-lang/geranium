The visualization consists of five parallel linear tracks, each representing a different chromosome (chr1 to chr5) using a multivec file. Each track displays genomic data with area plots, where the x-axis shows genomic positions and the y-axis represents quantitative peak values. The areas are colored according to various samples, including 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', with colors ranging from blue and orange to green and red.

Below each area plot, an ideogram features text labels for cytogenetic bands, colored according to their density. Light to dark shades of gray indicate different density values, while purple rectangles represent "gvar" stains, and maroon triangles indicate centromere positions. The tracks are static and arranged in a parallel format, offering a comprehensive view of the genome across these five chromosomes. The visualization uses data formatted in accordance with hg38 assembly standards.
