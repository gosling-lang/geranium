A circular visualization displays genomic data on chromosome 1. The layout consists of two tracks. The left track features a chord diagram with connections illustrating genomic range links. Each connection is color-coded based on genomic intervals. The right track is an area chart with multiple rows, depicting quantitative peak values across samples. Each row is categorized and color-coded per sample, showing variation across rows. The visualization is static, focusing on genomic intervals between 1 and 3,000,500 on chromosome 1, using a unified layout style and circular center radius for consistency.
