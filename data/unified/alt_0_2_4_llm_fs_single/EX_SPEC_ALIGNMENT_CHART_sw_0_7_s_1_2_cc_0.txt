The visualization consists of two main tracks arranged vertically. The first track presents alignment data for specific genomic intervals between positions 350 and 396, including a purple bar chart titled "Gap" showing gap values along the genomic axis on the y-axis, and a conservation bar chart colored based on conservation values represented with a "hot" color scale. 

The second track includes a detailed representation of sequences with rectangles and text for different sequences shown in distinct colors for base categories, depicting genomic samples with names. This part overlays components such as alignment, rectangular annotations, text, and conservation tracks, making it possible to view conservation scores and gap regions corresponding to genomic positions. Each base is highlighted in vibrant colors for easy differentiation. 

Furthermore, there is an overlaid chart displaying overall genomic intervals with three overlaid components: a rectangle chart for sequence alignment, a conservation bar chart using a gradient color scale, and a green bar chart representing gaps, all linked through an interactive brush for zooming into specific regions with position marks on the genomic axis. This visualization focuses on a portion of a genome, allowing users to explore alignment, conservation, and gaps efficiently.
