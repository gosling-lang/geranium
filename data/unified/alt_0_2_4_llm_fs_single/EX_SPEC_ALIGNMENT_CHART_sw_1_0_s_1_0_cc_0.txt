A visualization featuring two main views: a zoomable interactive view and a static overview. The interactive view, displaying between positions 350 and 396, includes three distinct layers: a bar chart titled "Gap" showing gaps in purple, another bar chart titled "Conservation" with a color gradient indicating conservation levels, and a categorical heatmap with text labels displaying sequence alignment across different samples. The color-coded rectangles represent different bases in the sequences. The static overview, aligned horizontally, shows the entire data range (0-396) with overlaid tracks: a categorical heatmap for sequence alignment, an unmarked genomic conservation bar chart, and a genomic gap bar chart. A brush tool, in red, facilitates navigation and highlights selected regions from the static overview in the interactive view. The layout is linear and arranged vertically, utilizing color and position effectively to represent genomic and quantitative data.
