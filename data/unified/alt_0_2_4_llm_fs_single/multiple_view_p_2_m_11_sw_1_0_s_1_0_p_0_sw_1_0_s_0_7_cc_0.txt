A multivec visualization displayed in a vertical arrangement of linked views, titled "Visual Linking." The top view consists of a linear layout and a circular layout side by side. The linear view shows genomic data of chromosome 1 as an area chart with four samples, each depicted in distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. An interactive brush allows selecting specific genomic ranges. The circular view to its right displays the same genomic data as a line chart, utilizing the same color scheme. Both charts are interactive, enabling linked selection. Below is another linear scatter plot displaying the genomic positions between 160,000,000 and 200,000,000 on chromosome 1. Points are colored according to sample categories, maintaining consistent color representation. The subtitle, "Change the position and range of brushes to update the detail view on the bottom," guides user interaction. The visualization leverages both area and point encoding to represent quantitative data.
