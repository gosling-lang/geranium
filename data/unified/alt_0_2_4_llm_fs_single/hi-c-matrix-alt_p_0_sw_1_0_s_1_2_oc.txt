A linear Hi-C matrix visualization showcasing genomic interactions between positions 800,000,000 and 1,800,000,000. The matrix overlays multiple tracks, integrating matrix data and annotations. The main matrix uses color intensity to represent contact frequencies, with grey tones indicating higher density. Vertical red lines and horizontal blue lines mark key genomic positions. Additional matrix overlays display interactions for chromosomes 6, 7, and 8, where points indicate specific coordinates with varying intensity and size denoting expression levels, colored in steel blue. The visualization is framed within a dashed style, emphasizing a structured layout for genomic data exploration.
