The visualization is a linear genomic range annotation track titled "IGV," displaying the chromosome 3 region between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. It consists of overlaying tracks showing gene annotations. Gene names are displayed as pink text, with corresponding pink rectangles representing gene ranges. White triangles within the rectangles indicate gene orientation, with filled patterns for different strands: leftward for negative and rightward for positive strands. The visualization uses a vertical arrangement and is stratified by strand.
