The visualization consists of a circular view and a linear view, arranged vertically. The circular view displays the entire genome with tracks for ideograms, genomic features, and structural variations within a circular ideogram. Notably, there are features labeled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' depicted with blue and orange rectangles, respectively. Lines connecting pairs of genomic positions represent structural variants, with colors indicating different types like translocation, duplication, and inversion.

The linear view zooms in on chromosome 1, featuring an ideogram at the top followed by tracks for genomic annotations, point mutations, and structural variants. The point mutation track, titled 'Point Mutation,' uses a scatter plot to show mutations, colored based on the type of nucleotide change. Additional tracks indicate 'Insertion', 'Deletion', and 'Copy Number Variants,' with rectangles indicating specific genomic ranges. A legend clarifies the color-coding for variants across both views. The views are linked, allowing navigation across the genomic context.
