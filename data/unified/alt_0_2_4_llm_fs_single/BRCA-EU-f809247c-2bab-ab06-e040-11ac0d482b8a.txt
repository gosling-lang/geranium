A circular and linear genomic visualization displaying the human genome assembly hg19. The circular view features five tracks, including an ideogram, a point annotation track titled "Putative Driver" in black text, and two range annotation tracks, "Gain" in sky blue rectangles and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" in dark orange rectangles. It also includes a line-connection track visualizing various structural variations using colorful arcs representing "Gain," "LOH," "Translocation," "Duplication," "Deletion," "Inversion (TtT)," and "Inversion (HtH)." 

The linear view shows chromosome 1, displaying similar tracks to the circular view. It features additional elements such as a gene annotation track with gray triangles for directionality, a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" with multicolored points indicating mutation subtypes, and two range annotation tracks labeled "Insertion" and "Deletion" with rectangles in light gray. The "Copy Number Variants" track uses gray for rectangles indicating numerical variation. 

The circular view is linked to the linear view using an interactive blue brush on the ideogram, facilitating navigation between genome-wide and regional insights.
