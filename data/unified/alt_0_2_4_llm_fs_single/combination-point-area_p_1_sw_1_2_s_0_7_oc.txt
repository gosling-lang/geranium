The visualization presents a linear, vertically arranged layout showcasing a genomic data representation of chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top chart is an area chart indicating the 'peak' values across four samples ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'). The genome is represented along the x-axis, while the y-axis displays quantitative values stratified by rows for each sample. Each sample is also distinguished by unique colors. The bottom chart is a scatter plot depicting the same genomic range, with point sizes and positions encoding expression values ('peak'). The plot uses color to differentiate among the samples and includes a transparency setting of 50%. Both charts are equipped with tooltips providing start and end positions, peak values, and sample identifiers. The visualization utilizes data from a multivec file with a horizontal orientation, utilizing the hg38 assembly.
