The visualization consists of a circular view and a linear view stacked vertically, linked by an interactive blue brush in the circular view. The circular view displays the entire genome using several tracks: a colorful ideogram, a text annotation track titled "Putative Driver," two genomic range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and a track with connections between genomic positions, using colors to indicate categories such as Translocation, Duplication, and Deletion. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, featuring tracks for ideograms, text annotations, range annotations for insertions and deletions, and a "Copy Number Variants" track. A scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" visualizes mutation data, with points colored by mutation subtype. The entire visualization provides an overview of genomic features with a focus on structural variations and annotations.
