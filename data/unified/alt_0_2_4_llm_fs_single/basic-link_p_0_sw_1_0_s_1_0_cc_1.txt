A linear layout visualization displaying genomic links on chromosome 1, titled "Basic Marks: Link." The chart uses curved lines to represent connections between genomic positions, drawn from data in a CSV file hosted on GitHub. Each connection is encoded with a lavender stroke, connecting start (s1) and end (e1) positions to their respective paired start (s2) and end (e2) positions. The genomic intervals are displayed on the x-axis with top-oriented axes, containing domains for ease of viewing.
