A circular line chart visualizes multiple time series derived from a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The layout comprises an overlay of tracks, with each track representing a sample. The line marks display the peaks of expression values across genomic positions. Different samples are distinguished by varying colors. The chart's stratification by rows illustrates the categorical division among the samples. Opacity levels vary across chart layers to reflect different quantitative domains. The chart references the study "Graphical perception of Multiple Time Series" by Javed et al., presented in TVCG 2010.
