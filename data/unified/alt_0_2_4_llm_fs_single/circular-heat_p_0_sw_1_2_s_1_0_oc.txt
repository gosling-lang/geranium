A circular heat map visualizes a multivec file, showing genomic intervals from chromosome 1 between 1 and 3,000,500. The data is stratified into four categories: 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4,' displayed in separate rows within the circular layout. Each category is encoded using color intensity, representing the quantitative value of the 'peak' field. The title is 'Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts' and the subtitle is 'Heatmap.' The visualization is static, with a legend showing the gradient of color values for clarity.
