This circular visualization displays genomic data with a focus on chromosome 1, covering the interval between 1 and 3,000,500. The layout is split into two sections, both arranged vertically but presented horizontally within the view.

The left track is a circular chart showcasing area plots that represent data from a multivec file. It features four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each differentiated by distinctive area colors, including blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis illustrates genomic positions, while the y-axis quantifies peaks. The data tooltip provides additional genomic start and end details, along with quantitative peak values.

On the right, a circular connectivity chart shows links between genomic intervals on the x-axis, highlighting structural connections within the data. Colors are used to distinguish different genomic intervals and their connections, adding a layer of categorical data representation.

Both charts are set on a circular layout with a center radius set at 0.5, ensuring clarity and accessibility for genomic interval analysis. The design emphasizes transparency through adjustable opacity, creating a cohesive and visually informative display of complex genomic data.
