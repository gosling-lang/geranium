The visualization consists of three stacked linear views illustrating genomic data on chromosome 13 between positions 31,500,000 and 33,150,000. Each view contains two main tracks: a genomic range annotation track showing gene structures and a significance track displaying genetic variant classifications.

1. **Genomic Range Annotation Track (HiGlass)**: 
   - The genomic range is represented with genes annotated as arrows, indicating transcription direction (right for "+" strand and left for "-"). 
   - Gene names such as "FRY," "BRCA2," and "NBPF2L2" are labeled accordingly.
   - Exons are displayed as rectangles within the gene structures, colored differently based on strand direction.

2. **Significance Track**: 
   - This track features bars and points marking genetic variants and their clinical significance.
   - Variants are categorized as "Pathogenic," "Likely Pathogenic," "Uncertain Significance," etc., using a color-coded scheme (e.g., purple for "Pathogenic," green for "Likely Benign").
   - Points and bars vary in size and opacity based on their zoom level visibility.

Color and styling attributes are configured to enhance readability and differentiation. This visualization efficiently combines detailed genomic annotations with variant significance data, providing a comprehensive view across multiple resolution scales.
