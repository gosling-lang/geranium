The visualization consists of two tracks arranged vertically in a linear layout, focusing on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track features a bar chart that displays genomic intervals on the x-axis with expression values represented by bars on the y and ye-axes. The chart is divided by rows indicating different samples, highlighted in distinct colors such as blue, orange, green, and red. The bottom track presents an area chart where the x-axis represents genomic positions and the y-axis shows expression values through filled areas. It is also stratified by rows to depict different samples, using the same color scheme. The data is visualized from a multivec file, allowing interaction through tooltips showing peak values and sample information. The design includes black strokes for bars and white strokes for the area chart, enhancing clarity.
