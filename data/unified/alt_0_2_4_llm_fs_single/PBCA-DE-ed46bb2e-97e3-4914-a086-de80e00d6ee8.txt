A circular and linear genomic view, linked by an interactive brush, visualize chromosomal data for the assembly hg19. The circular view includes five tracks: an ideogram, a track titled "Putative Driver" with black text annotations, a "Gain" track with blue rectangles, a "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" track with orange rectangles, and connection lines visualizing structural variations. The linear view mirrors these tracks and adds a gene annotation track, a scatterplot titled "Point Mutation" showing colored points according to mutation subtype, and a "Copy Number Variants" track with gray rectangles.
