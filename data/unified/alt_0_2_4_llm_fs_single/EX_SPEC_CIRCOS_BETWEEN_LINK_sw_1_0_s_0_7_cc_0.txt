A circular visualization titled "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements" displays genomic data using a stacked arrangement. The outer layer is a circular bar chart representing genomic positions with bars colored in sky blue, indicating expression levels on the y-axis. Two circular ideograms below the bar chart show different chromosomal regions with categories distinguished by varied colors of rectangles. The innermost layer features a circular chart with numerous connections marked in green and gray, showing genomic interactions between positions. This design uses data from multiple sources, including multivec and CSV files, effectively presenting genomic structures and relationships.
