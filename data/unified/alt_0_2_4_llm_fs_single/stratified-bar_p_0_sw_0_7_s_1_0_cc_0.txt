The linear layout visualization features a bar chart displaying genomic data across chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The chart is stratified into four rows representing 'sample 1' to 'sample 4', each marked by distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis indicates genomic position, and the y-axis shows expression values quantified as 'peak'. This setup highlights category-based comparisons, with a tooltip feature providing detailed genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample information. The data is sourced from a multivec file associated with the assembly hg38.
