A series of charts visualize genomic data with a focus on mark displacement. The main title is "Mark Displacement," and the subtitle explains the use of displacement options to address visual overlaps.

1. **Top Chart (Transcripts on chr3):** 
   - Displays genomic transcripts on chromosome 3 (interval 142,500,000 to 143,000,000).
   - Marks include right and left arrows, lines, and text indicating gene names like PLS1 and TRPC1. 
   - Up to 15 rows of data are visualized, with genes color-coded by strand: blue for '+' and orange for '-'.

2. **Middle Chart (Variants on chr2):**
   - Shows "Likely Benign" variants on chromosome 2 (interval 126,800,000 to 127,700,000).
   - Points and lines are marked with connections to gene annotations.
   - Features texts representing nucleotide bases, color-coded by letter (A, T, G, C).
   - Arrows and rectangles depict genes like BIN1 and MYO7B, colored according to strand.

3. **Bottom Chart (Features on chr17):**
   - Displays a deep pileup of points colored by significance on chromosome 17 (interval 43,080,000 to 43,120,000).
   - Points are positioned to avoid overlaps, using a "pile" method.
   - The chartâ€™s layout includes significant genomic features marked in
