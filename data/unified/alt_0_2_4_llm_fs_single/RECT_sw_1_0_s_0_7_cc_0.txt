A linear genomic ideogram visualizes data from a CSV file, displaying chromosome 1 with color-coded categories. The chart is titled "Basic Marks: Rect" and shows genomic intervals along the x-axis. Different categories such as 'gneg', 'gpos25', and others are represented by various colors, including blue, orange, and green. The visualization includes a stroke outline for the rectangles, offering distinction and clarity between categories. The subtitle is "Tutorial Examples".
