A circular genome visualization displays three distinct data tracks using the hg38 assembly. The first track is a bar chart, showing genomic loci on the x-axis and peaks on the y-axis, colored in sky blue. The second track is a cyclic ideogram, representing chromosome bands with various colors indicating different stain categories. The third track, overlaid, illustrates connections between genomic segments across all chromosomes, with lines in multiple colors to represent distinct chromosomal pairs and relationships. The layout is circular, employing a stacked alignment to integrate the different data tracks smoothly.
