The visualization titled "Visual Encoding" with the subtitle "Arcs" uses a linear layout to display genomic connections in chromosome 1, covering the interval from 1 to 3,000,500. The arcs represent links between genomic positions, with the start and end points encoded using fields 's1' and 'e2'. The color of the arcs is determined by the starting position 's1', adding a categorical aspect to the visualization. The arcs are partially transparent, allowing overlapping regions to be seen. The chart is structured in a vertical arrangement, enhancing clarity in the representation of overlapping genomic regions.
