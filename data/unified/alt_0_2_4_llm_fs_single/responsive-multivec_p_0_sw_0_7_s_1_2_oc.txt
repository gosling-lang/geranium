The visualization is a responsive bar chart in a linear layout depicting a multivec dataset, focusing on chromosome 12 within the interval of 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. It stratifies data across multiple samples using different colors for each category. Each bar represents a genomic position, with height indicating quantitative values from the 'peak' field. The chart features dynamic visibility; opacities and visibility of tracks change based on chart height, ensuring better adaptability and readability across various viewing conditions. The reference for the visualization is cited as Javed et al. in their 2010 study on graphical perception of multiple time series.
