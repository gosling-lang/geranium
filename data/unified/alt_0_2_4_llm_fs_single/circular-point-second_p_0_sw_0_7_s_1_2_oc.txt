A circular scatter plot displays multivec data with genomic positions from chromosome 1 between 1 and 3,000,500. The circular layout shows expression values using points whose sizes represent peak values. Points are colored based on sample categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The chart includes a top axis for genomic positions and provides a legend for categories. Opacity is set to 0.5 to visualize overlapping points, with tooltips detailing start and end positions, values, and sample information.
