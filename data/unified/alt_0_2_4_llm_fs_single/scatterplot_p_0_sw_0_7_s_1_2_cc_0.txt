A linear scatter plot visualizing a multivec file, representing genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The x-axis encodes genomic positions, and the y-axis represents quantitative expression values. Different samples, four in total, are distinguished by point colors - blue, orange, green, and red. The opacity is set to 0.5 for a visual blending effect. Each point's size correlates with its quantitative value ('peak'), enhancing the visual representation of data magnitude. The legend aids in identifying samples, while tooltips provide details such as start and end genomic positions and sample names for interactive data exploration.
