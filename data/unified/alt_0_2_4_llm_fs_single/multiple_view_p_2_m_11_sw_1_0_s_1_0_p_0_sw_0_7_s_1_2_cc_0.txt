A vertical arrangement of visualizations links overview and detail views using visual brushes. The visualization begins with a top section containing an area chart and a circular line chart. Both charts depict genomic data from chromosome 1, where each category—'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'—is represented with distinctive colors: blue, orange, green, and red. An interactive brush in the linear area chart allows dynamic updates to the lower, detailed section by selecting specific genomic ranges. 

In the circular chart, the genome is displayed with color-coded lines, depicting the data categories similarly to the area chart. 

The bottom section provides a detailed view of chromosome 1, between positions 160,000,000 and 200,000,000. Here, the scatter plot further breaks down the data into color-coded points distributed by the 'peak' value for each sample. This interactive visualization, titled "Visual Linking," enables synchronized exploration across different scales through linked data brushing.
