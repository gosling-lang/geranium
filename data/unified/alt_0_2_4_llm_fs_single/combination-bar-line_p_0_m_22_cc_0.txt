A linear layout visualization showcases a multivec file for chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The top track is a scatter plot with points representing genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. The points are colored categorically to distinguish between 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The bottom track is an overlay chart displaying area plots. The genomic positions are on the x-axis, and expression values determine the area size and height. Rows are stratified by sample categories, each highlighted with distinct colors.
