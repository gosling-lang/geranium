A linear bar chart visualizes a multivec file, depicting the genomic sequence across multiple chromosomes. The chart features semantic zooming, where text marks indicating base pairs appear as users zoom in. Categories 'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C' are represented with distinct colors for easy identification. The title is 'Example: Semantic Zooming' with the subtitle 'Text marks that indicate base pairs will appear when zooming in.' The x-axis shows genomic positions, and the y-axis represents the count of each base. Bars are color-coded for each base type, and text annotations become visible under specific zoom conditions, enhancing interactive exploration.
