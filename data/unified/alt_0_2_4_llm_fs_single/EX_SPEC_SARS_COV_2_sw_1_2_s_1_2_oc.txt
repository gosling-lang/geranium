The visualization is a detailed linear representation of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, sourced from the WashU Virus Genome Browser, NCBI, and GISAID. It features two main sections: 

1. **NC_045512.2 Genes**: Displayed as a series of navy blue rectangles along a x-axis representing the genome from position 1 to 29,903. White lines with a triangular pattern are used to indicate specific genomic features, linked to an interactive brush for exploration. Black text labels denote gene symbols.

2. **S Protein Annotation**: Illustrates protein domains such as 'receptor-binding domain (RBD)' and 'S1/S2 cleavage site,' with categories represented as colored rectangles. These annotations are organized in rows for clarity.

The subsequent sequence data shows nucleotide frequency across the genome with bar height representing count, and color coding distinguishes between bases (A, T, G, C). 

Lastly, the TRS-L-Dependent Recombination Events is visualized with curved connections in a light navy blue, indicating genomic positions where recombination events occur, providing insights into structural genome rearrangements.
