A visualization titled "Visual Linking" displays genomic data using a combination of circular and linear bar charts with interactive features. The visualization is structured vertically, featuring a circular chart on top followed by two linear charts. 

The circular chart illustrates genomic intervals on chromosome 1, with expression data shown as bars, stratified by category rows. Each category is color-coded with distinct hues: blue, orange, green, and red. An interactive brush links this circular view to the subsequent linear views.

The first linear chart maintains the same genomic representation as the circular chart but displays it in a horizontal format. The brushed regions on the x-axis dynamically update the view, providing detailed exploration functionality.

The second linear chart delves deeper, focusing on the interval from 160,000,000 to 200,000,000 on chromosome 1. It provides a detailed view of expression data, maintaining the same categorical coloring for consistency.

Overall, the visualization effectively combines interactive and static elements, allowing for exploratory analysis of multivec data across genomic positions and categories.
