The visualization titled "Visual Encoding" with the subtitle "Gosling provides diverse visual encoding methods" consists of multiple chart types arranged in a linear vertical layout. This figure includes:

1. A heat map displaying the genomic data across chromosome 1 to chromosome Y, stratified by samples 1 to 4. The color intensity represents the expression values.

2. Three different bar charts where genomic positions are on the x-axis and expression levels are on the y-axis, categorized by sample and color-coded for clarity.

3. A combined line chart and scatter plot overlay with lines and points representing expression levels. The point size is determined by the peak value of each genomic position.

4. Two scatter plots where the genomic data is displayed horizontally and expression levels vertically, with points color-coded by sample type and sized by peak values.

5. An area chart showing expression values filled beneath the genomic positions, color-coded by samples.

6. A bar chart displaying both minimum and maximum peak values within given ranges, color-coded by samples, with black borders defining the bar edges.

7. Lastly, an interleaved connection chart shows connections across specified genomic intervals, color-coded by the genomic starting position, with transparency effects for visual clarity.

Overall, this visualization explores various visual encoding methods to effectively present genomic data, with interactivity supported through tooltips to provide detailed information about each data point.
