The visualization is a genomic range annotation track titled "HiGlass," displaying data from chromosome 3, interval 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. It employs a linear layout with a horizontal arrangement. Tracks are stratified by strand: positive (+) strands are displayed in blue, and negative (-) strands in red. Each gene is represented with directional triangles indicating the strand direction, text labels for gene names, and rectangles for exons. The visualization utilizes variable shapes such as right-facing triangles for positive strands, left for negative, and pattern rules to highlight strand orientation. Tracks are layered vertically with color, size, and opacity encoding to differentiate elements.
