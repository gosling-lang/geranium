A circular bar chart visualizes genomic data from a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The chart consists of bars that represent quantitative values (labeled as 'peak') on the y-axis. The bars are color-coded according to four sample categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', as highlighted in the legend. Tooltip information provides genomic start and end positions along with the respective quantitative values. The chart is arranged in a vertical layout with a center radius of 0.5, utilizing a circular arrangement that maintains consistency in data representation across different samples.
