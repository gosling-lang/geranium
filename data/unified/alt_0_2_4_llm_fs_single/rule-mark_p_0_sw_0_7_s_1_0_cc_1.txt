A linear bar chart visualizes genomic data from a multivec file in the hg38 assembly. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis shows quantitative values of 'peak' with a domain from 0 to 0.003. Bars are colored sky blue. Overlaid on this are two 'rule' tracks. The first shows horizontal and vertical lines with stroke width corresponding to a quantitative field 'v', colored purple. The second shows vertical lines at specific genomic positions with a fixed stroke width, colored pink. The visualization is annotated with dashed horizontal and vertical rules, reinforcing genomic annotations. The title is "Rule Mark" with a subtitle "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines."
