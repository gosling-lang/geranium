The visualization is an overlaid Hi-C matrix illustrating genomic interactions using bars and annotations within a linear layout. It showcases interactions between genomic regions across chromosomes 5 to 10. The matrix is displayed with color intensity to represent quantitative values, employing a "hot" color scheme. Annotations include blue vertical lines and pink horizontal lines indicating specific genomic positions on the axes. A separate rectangular grid highlights the different categories using strokes. Additionally, a chart over the matrix maps points to genomic positions, with point size and opacity based on data values, and displayed in purple with a white stroke. The width and height of the visualization are set to 600 units each, with the entire genome captured within the interval from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000.
