The visualization is composed of three linear, stacked panels showcasing genomic data along chromosome 13 of hg38. Each panel contains a genomic range annotation track titled 'HiGlass' that features gene structures with forward and reverse strand orientations, indicated by blue and red color coding respectively. Gene names, such as 'FRY,' 'BRCA2,' and 'PDS5B,' are displayed alongside their genomic positions. Additionally, there are overlapping tracks depicting clinical significance data. These include bar and point markings representing various classifications like 'Pathogenic,' 'Likely pathogenic,' and 'Benign,' which are color-coded in shades ranging from pink to green. The panels cover specific intervals, allowing detailed examination of the genomic regions and associated clinical data.
