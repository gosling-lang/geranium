A bar chart with text labels uses semantic zooming to visualize a multivec file of genomic data. The layout is linear, displaying base pairs across various chromosomes. Bars represent quantitative counts, categorized by bases 'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C'. The color of each bar corresponds to its base category, visible in intervals on the x-axis. As you zoom in, text labels indicating base pairs appear amidst the bars, written in white. The chart titled 'Example: Semantic Zooming' emphasizes text marks highlighting base pairs upon close examination.
