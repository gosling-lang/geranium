A set of linear tracks showcases the genomic data visualization in Gosling.js. The first track is a genomic range annotation displaying the region on chromosome 3 from 52,168,000 to 52,890,000, visualized using gene annotation with gray-colored marks indicating strand direction and exon positions. The second track features a sequence bar chart focusing on chromosome 1 from 77,925,299 to 77,925,320, indicating nucleotide counts for bases A, T, G, and C, with distinct colors. The third track is an ideogram of chromosome 1, displaying cytogenetic bands with text annotations, accompanied by left and right triangles in distinct categories. The overall visualization is titled "Track Template In Gosling.js" and utilizes smooth paths for enhanced clarity.
