The visualization is a linear genomic range annotation track titled "IGV," focusing on chromosome 3, between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. It features an overlay arrangement with multiple tracks displaying gene annotations from a BED database. The visualization includes text labels for gene names and rectangular shapes denoting gene locations. The chart is differentiated by strand, with "+" and "âˆ’" strands represented as rows. The primary color used is green, and the chart employs white arrow patterns to indicate gene direction, enhancing visual clarity.
