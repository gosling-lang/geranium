A circular visualization of genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning from 1 to 3,000,500. The left circular chart displays area plots for four samples, with the x-axis representing genomic position and the y-axis showing quantitative peak values. Colors differentiate the samples: 'sample 1' (yellow), 'sample 2' (green), 'sample 3' (blue), and 'sample 4' (purple). The right circular chart shows genomic links using a within-link display, mapping connections between genomic coordinates from 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. Both charts are arranged horizontally within a circular layout with a center radius of 0.5.
