The visualization displays both circular and linear views arranged vertically. The circular view encompasses the full genome (hg19) with multiple tracks: an ideogram, point annotation, two range annotations, and links between genomic positions. The ideogram is interactive with a blue brush for linking to the linear view. Range annotations are titled 'Gain' (blue) and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' (orange). The link track connects structural variations, including 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversions'. The linear view, displaying chromosome 1, features an ideogram, driver mutations, gene annotations, point mutations (colored by subtype), and copy number variants (gray rectangles). It also includes additional range tracks for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion', with tracks colored to indicate different data categories.
