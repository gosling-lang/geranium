A visualization titled "Mark Displacement" showcases genomic data across multiple tracks, focusing on handling visual overlaps using displacement. The visualization consists of layered tracks:

1. **Transcript Track:**
   - Displays genomic intervals on chromosome 3 between 142,500,000 and 143,000,000.
   - Transcript structures are shown with right and left-oriented triangular annotations, lines, and rectangles color-coded by strand: blue for "+" and orange for "-".
   - A text track labels gene names within these intervals, allowing a maximum of 15 rows.

2. **Likely Benign Variation Track:**
   - Highlights a region on chromosome 2 between 126,800,000 and 127,700,000, emphasizing "Likely Benign" variants.
   - Uses green points and various colored text annotations corresponding to nucleotide changes.
   - Connections between genomic positions are represented by green lines.

3. **Genomic Variation Track:**
   - Focuses on chromosome 17 between 43,080,000 and 43,120,000.
   - Visualizes different types of pathogenicity using color-coded points, including categories such as "Pathogenic" and "Benign".

This comprehensive view utilizes techniques like point displacement and categorical coloring to ensure clarity and enhance the interpretability of overlapping genomic features.
