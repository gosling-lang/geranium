A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart displays multiple rows, each representing a different sample. The layout adapts between circular and linear based on aspect ratio. Bars indicate expression levels, stratified by color for different samples. The chart is designed to adjust height responsiveness while maintaining a fixed width, showcasing detailed genomic data across the selected interval.
