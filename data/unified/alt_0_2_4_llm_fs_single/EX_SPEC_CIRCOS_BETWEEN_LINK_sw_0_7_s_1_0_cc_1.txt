A circular visualization featuring a multi-layer structure, displaying genomic data with a focus on connections between regions. The outermost layer is a bar chart representing 'sample 1' peaks in purple. Two ideogram layers depict chromosomal bands, color-coded by stain categories, providing structural insights into the genome. At the core, a densely interconnected network of black and light gray links illustrates genomic relationships and segmental duplications. The chart is titled 'Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements,' emphasizing its arrangement and focus on genomic connectivity within the circular format.
