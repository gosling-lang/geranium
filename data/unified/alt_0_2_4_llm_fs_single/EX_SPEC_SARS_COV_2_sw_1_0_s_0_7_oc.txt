A linear genomic visualization of the SARS-CoV-2 genome encompasses various tracks illustrating different aspects of viral data. The primary track, titled "NC_045512.2 Genes," is depicted using navy rectangles with white lines and black text showing gene symbols. A brush interactivity feature is available for detailed exploration, linking to a subview. The subview displays protein annotations with rows colored according to categories like 'receptor-binding domain (RBD)' and 'heptad repeat 1 (HR1).'

Another primary track is a bar chart representing the sequence, with colors indicating nucleotide bases 'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C'. A TRS-L-dependent recombination events track uses arcs to connect genomic positions, highlighting potential recombination sites in light blue. The visualization is based on data from sources such as the WashU Virus Genome Browser, NCBI, and GISAID, covering the complete 29,903-base sequence of NC_045512.2.
