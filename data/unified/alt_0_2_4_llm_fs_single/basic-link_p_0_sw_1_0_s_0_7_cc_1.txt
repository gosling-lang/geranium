A linear layout visualization titled "Basic Marks: Link" showcases within-link connections across genomic intervals on chromosome 1. The arcs link starting and ending positions, with both x and x1 specified as genomic fields on the domain of chromosome 1. The arcs are styled in a light purple stroke, adding a visual layer to genomic data retrieved from a CSV source. The subtitle "Tutorial Examples" suggests an introductory context, aligning with the simple design focused on linkage representation.
