A circular bar chart in a radial layout visualizes a vector data file, showing the whole genome sequences of hg38. Each bar represents an expression value plotted against genomic positions. The bars are color-coded in light yellow. The x-axis, displayed in a circular format, represents genomic coordinates, while the y-axis measures quantitative values. The chart has a fixed layout with a central radius for visual appeal.
