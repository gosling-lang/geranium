A genomic visualization demonstrates mark displacement across multiple chromosomes using data from beddb files. Two main genomic regions are highlighted: chromosome 3 and chromosome 2. The first track, "hg38 | Transcript (Max. 15 Rows)," displays gene annotations on chromosome 3 between 142,500,000 and 143,000,000, with marks represented by text, triangles, rectangles, and lines, colored by strand. Chromosome 2 features a track titled "Likely Benign," visualizing likely benign variants using points, color-coded bases, and arrows. Connections illustrate relationships between variants. A third track spans chromosome 17 from 43,080,000 to 43,120,000, showing point annotations colored by variant significance, overlayed in a linear layout. Overall, the visualization effectively addresses visual overlaps by employing a displacement technique, enhancing clarity and readability.
