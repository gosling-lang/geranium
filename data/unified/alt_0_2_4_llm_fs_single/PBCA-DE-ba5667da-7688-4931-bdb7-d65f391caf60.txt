The visualization comprises a circular and a linear view linked by an interactive blue brush in the circular view. The circular view showcases the entire genome, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. The circular layout includes an ideogram track and multiple annotation tracks. The first track uses the circular ideogram to display genomic bands with a brush link. The 'Putative Driver' track represents gene information with black text. The 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' tracks visualize genomic changes in sky blue and dark orange rectangles, respectively. The 'svclass' track shows connections between genomic positions, color-coded for 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' 'Inversion (TtT),' and 'Inversion (HtH).' In the linear view, tracks include a detailed ideological view, the 'Putative Driver' text track, and replication variations like 'Copy Number Variants' depicted in gray rectangles. The 'Point Mutation' scatterplot reveals mutation distances with points in various colors, indicating different substitution types. This integrated genomic visualization allows in-depth exploration of structural variations and mutations.
