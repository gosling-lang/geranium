A linear visualization of genomic data displays two tracks arranged vertically. Both tracks use a multivec data source visualizing chromosome 1 over an interval of 1 to 3,000,500. The top track features an area chart where the x-axis represents genomic position and the y-axis represents quantitative expression values. Different colors indicate four distinct samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The bottom track overlays area and bar charts, stratified by sample rows. Here, the x-axis again shows genomic positions, while the y-axis shows expression with both area and bar marks, conveying peak values. The color differentiates the samples, with a legend provided for clarity.
