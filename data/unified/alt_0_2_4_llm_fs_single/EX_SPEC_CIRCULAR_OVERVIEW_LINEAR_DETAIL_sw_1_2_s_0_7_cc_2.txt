A circular visualization displays genomic data across several chromosomes, using multivec files in a stacked arrangement. The data presents four samples with color-coded categories, represented in shades of blue, orange, green, and red. The circular view features a connection overlay highlighting genomic rearrangements like deletions, inversions, translocations, and tandem duplications. The connections are styled with purple strokes.

Below the circular chart, two detailed horizontal bar charts display genomic data for chromosomes 5 and 16. Each bar chart shows expression values along the y-axis, stratified by sample categories. Interactive blue and red brushes link the x-axis from the circular view to these linear charts, emphasizing specific regions in both chromosome 5 and chromosome 16. The entire visualization is set in a vertical layout, allowing for comprehensive genomic examination.
