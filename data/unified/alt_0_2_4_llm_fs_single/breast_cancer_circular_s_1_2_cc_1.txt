A circular genomic visualization displays different types of structural variations across the hg38 genome. The outermost track is a circular ideogram colored based on cyto-band stain categories. Following this, two circular charts with rectangles represent different genomic data from a CSV file. The first inner track shows regions with zero minor copy numbers in tumors, marked in pink. The second displays regions with high total copy numbers in tumors, marked in purple. The innermost track features connections indicating genomic rearrangements like tandem-duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions. Each type of rearrangement is uniquely colored and outlined to convey distinct categories.
