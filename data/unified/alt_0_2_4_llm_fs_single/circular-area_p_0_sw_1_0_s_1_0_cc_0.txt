A circular area chart in a vertical arrangement visualizes a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500. The chart features four stratified areas — 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4' — each represented by different colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis depicts genomic positions, and the y-axis represents expression values. The chart includes a legend indicating the color associated with each sample.
