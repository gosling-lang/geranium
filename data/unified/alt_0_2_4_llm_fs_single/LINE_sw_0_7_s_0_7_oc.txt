The visualization is a line chart in a linear layout, displaying genomic data from a multivec file of the hg38 assembly. The x-axis represents genomic positions, and the y-axis shows quantitative expression values, depicted as lines. The chart is titled "Basic Marks: line" with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples." Data is shown for "sample 1," with line size coded to a fixed value. This visualization conveys changes in expression values across genomic positions in an orange line format.
