A comprehensive genomic visualization combines circular and linear layouts to display data related to chromosome analysis. The circular view includes several tracks: an ideogram, a text track labeled "Putative Driver," and two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," which use light blue and dark orange rectangles, respectively, to represent genomic ranges. Additionally, a connection track with lines in various colors illustrates structural variations like "Translocation," "Duplication," and "Deletion."

In the linear view, an ideogram shows chromosome 1, linked to the circular view via an interactive brush. This layout includes text annotations like "Putative Driver," visualized as black text, and a scatter plot labeled "Point Mutation," where points represent mutation distances and are colored according to mutation subtypes. Furthermore, two range annotation tracks titled "Copy Number Variants" and "Gain" utilize grey and light blue rectangles to denote specific genomic ranges. A categorical legend is provided to explain the colors used in the connection track, elucidating different structural variation types.
