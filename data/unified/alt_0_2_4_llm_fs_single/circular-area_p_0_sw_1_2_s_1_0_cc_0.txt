A circular chart arranged vertically displays a multivec file, visualizing genomic data for chromosome 1 within the interval from 1 to 3,000,500. The chart uses an area mark to represent quantitative peaks, which are differentiated by color for each of the four samples: 'sample 1' (blue), 'sample 2' (orange), 'sample 3' (green), and 'sample 4' (red). The chart is stratified by rows, with each row corresponding to a sample, and expression values are displayed on the y-axis. The chart's stroke is white, providing contrast for the overlapping areas. Tooltip functionality is available, displaying the start and end positions, peak values, and sample information for precise data interaction and analysis.
