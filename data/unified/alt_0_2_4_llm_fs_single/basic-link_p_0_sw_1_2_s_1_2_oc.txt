A linear layout visualization titled "Basic Marks: Link" shows genomic relationships using a CSV file. This visualization depicts chromosomal data from chromosome 1 of the hg38 assembly. The x-axes represent genomic intervals indicating start ('s1') and end ('e1'), along with secondary positions ('s2' and 'e2'). Arcs in the chart express these linkages in steel blue, illustrating connections within the chromosome. The subtitle "Tutorial Examples" is included, with no defined static or zoom limits.
