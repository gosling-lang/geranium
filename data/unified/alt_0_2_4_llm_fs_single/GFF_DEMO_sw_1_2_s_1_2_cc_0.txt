A linear genome visualization shows a segment of the E. coli genome (chromosome U00096.3) between positions 222,000 and 240,000. The visualization overlays multiple tracks, representing genes on both strands using right and left triangles. Genes are labeled at their genomic start positions and are color-coded by gene type, such as protein-coding, tRNA, rRNA, ncRNA, pseudogene, and unknown. Strand orientation is depicted with triangles pointing in the direction of transcription, and lines connect start and end positions, styled with smooth paths and triangular patterns. The title is "GFF3 file," and the subtitle is "E. coli genome, colored by gene type."
