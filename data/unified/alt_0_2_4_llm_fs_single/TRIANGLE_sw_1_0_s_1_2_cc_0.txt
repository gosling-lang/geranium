A linear genomic visualization titled 'Basic Marks: Triangles' uses a tile-based BedDB file. It stratifies data into two rows based on the 'strand' attribute, represented as '+' and '-'. The '+' strand shows right-pointing blue triangles, while the '-' strand shows left-pointing orange triangles, signifying gene direction across chromosomes 1 to Y on the x-axis. The visualization highlights color-coded gene orientation in a genomic context, with an opacity setting of 0.8 for visual clarity, primarily focusing on the directional markers. The chart is supplemented by a subtitle 'Tutorial Examples' for additional context.
