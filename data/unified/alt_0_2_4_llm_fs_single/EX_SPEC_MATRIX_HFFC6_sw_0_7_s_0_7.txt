A matrix visualization displays a comparison of Micro-C and Hi-C data for HFFc6 cells on chromosome 7, between positions 77,700,000 and 81,000,000. The layout is horizontal, with vertical arrangements of bar and matrix tracks. The left panel features bar charts for HFFc6_H3K4me3 in dark green, HFFc6_ATAC in orange, and HFFC6_CTCF in navy blue. Overlaid right and left genomic position annotations are shown as triangles, colored pink and green, respectively. A matrix track titled 'HFFc6_Micro-C' visualizes genomic interactions with color intensity. The right panel mirrors these tracks but includes a different matrix titled ‘HFFc6_Hi-C.’ An 'Epilogos (hg38)' track at the bottom presents data in various colors indicating different categories of epigenomic states. The visualization is styled with a light gray background.
