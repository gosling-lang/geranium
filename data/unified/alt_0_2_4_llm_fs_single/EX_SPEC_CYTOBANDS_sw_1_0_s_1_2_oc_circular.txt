The visualization is a series of concentric circular charts arranged in a parallel configuration, displaying genomic data across chromosomes 1 to 5 from the hg38 assembly. Each circular layer consists of two tracks. The first track is an area chart displaying quantitative peaks for four samples, colored differently to indicate categories. The second track is an ideogram showing cytogenetic bands, including various densities and special markings like purple rectangles for "gvar" and maroon triangles for "acen" regions. This setup efficiently visualizes genomic positions (x-axis) and quantitative values (y-axis) in a compact form.
