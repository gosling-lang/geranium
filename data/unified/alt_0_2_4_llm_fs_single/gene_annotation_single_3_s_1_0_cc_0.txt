The visualization is a linear genomic range annotation track titled 'HiGlass,' displaying data on chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The track is arranged horizontally and features a vertical arrangement of annotations showing gene structures. Genes are represented using triangles to indicate directionality, with right-facing triangles for genes on the positive strand and left-facing triangles on the negative strand. Text annotations provide the gene names. Exons are indicated by rectangles, and connecting lines reflect the structure and orientation of the genes. The annotations are stratified by strand, with blue used for the positive strand and orange for the negative strand, enhancing clarity and visual distinction.
