A circular visualization composed of three interrelated charts displays genomic data titled "Circos." The first chart is a circular bar chart, using the x-axis to represent genomic positions and the y-axis for quantitative expression values, visualized through green bars. The second chart is a circular ideogram illustrating chromosomal bands, with rectangles colored by category. The third chart connects genomic intervals with lines of varying colors, representing categorical information from the connected data field 'chr_2.' Each track in the visualization overlays the previous, creating a comprehensive circular genome visualization. The overall size is 700 by 700, and it uses the hg38 genome assembly.
