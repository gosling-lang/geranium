A linear visualization with two vertically arranged tracks displays genomic data. The top track is a bar chart representing four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The x-axis shows genomic positions on chromosome 1, from 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs, while the y-axis indicates peak values. The bars are separated by rows corresponding to each sample, with distinct colors for each sample. The lower track, a heat map, encodes expression values using color intensity, also partitioned by sample categories. These tracks utilize data from a multivec file with categories, position, and peak data fields.
