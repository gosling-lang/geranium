A circular line chart visualizes a multivec file for chromosome 12 spanning from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The data is represented with lines on the y-axis, stratified by 14 samples, excluding 'sample -.' Each sample is displayed in distinct colors, such as blue, orange, and green. The chart includes multiple overlays, reflecting different opacity levels and y-axis domains, capturing quantitative variations of the 'peak' attribute across samples. The reference for this visualization is "Graphical perception of Multiple Time Series" by Javed et al., TVCG 2010.
