Based on the visualization's JSON specification, alt text, attribute classification, and processed spec, here's a detailed text description for the multimodal search engine:

---

A circular scatter plot in a multivec file displays data across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. Each point represents a sample's genomic position (x-axis) and its expression value (y-axis), with the point's size indicating the expression magnitude. This visualization features four samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4'), color-coded in blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The circular layout enhances comparison between samples in a compact area. Data is sourced from a multivec file via a URL. The plot includes interactive tooltips displaying start and end genomic positions, peak values, and sample category, providing a comprehensive data exploration experience. The plot's opacity is set to 0.5 for a translucent appearance, and grid lines on the y-axis assist in value estimation.
