A linear layout visualization showcases chromosome 1 from 1 to 2,000,000 positions, using different BED file types. The visualization includes four tracks titled "BED12," "BED6," "BED6+6," and "BED12+1." Each track displays genomic ranges through colored rectangles, with green representing "BED12" and "BED6," and purple representing "BED6+6" and "BED12+1." Each rectangle signifies a genomic interval with standardized and custom fields based on BED specifications. The title is "BED files" with the subtitle "Demonstration of using BED files of different specifications."
