The visualization showcases a genomic ideogram and annotation tracks over a linear layout. The genomic ideogram displays chromosome 1 marked by rects and triangles with distinct colors based on "Stain" categories, such as gneg, gpos, and others. Gene annotations are visualized using right and left triangles for strands with a color scheme representing strand orientation. Below, two rectangular tracks display copy number variations (CNVs) in green for minor copy number in tumors and blue for total copy number. The final track, a connection graph, depicts structural variations like tandem-duplications and translocations, with lines colored and stroked according to "svclass". Each track provides insight into genomic intervals and variations, with tooltip interactivity for detailed data exploration.
