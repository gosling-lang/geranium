A multi-row bar chart in a linear layout displays a multivec file, showcasing chromosome 1 between base pairs 1 and 3,000,500. The visualization includes four rows representing 'sample 1' through 'sample 4,' each depicted with distinct colors. Bars display the range of values between 'peak_min' and 'peak_max,' and are color-coded by sample category. The chart is arranged vertically with data stratified by rows, and a legend is displayed for color reference. The x-axis presents genomic intervals, with tooltips providing detailed information on genomic positions and value ranges.
