The visualization titled "Hi-C Matrix" showcases a genomic heatmap, emphasizing the chromosomal regions from 800 million to 1.8 billion base pairs. Employing a linear overlay layout, it integrates multiple data tracks to depict Hi-C interactions and annotations. The primary matrix uses color intensity to signify interaction values, with warmer colors representing higher interactions. Overlaid are vertical and horizontal rules in purple and sky blue, indicating specific genomic positions. Additional tracks display genomic intervals with varying colors and stroke types to categorize different interaction strengths. A unique set of pink points marks specific expressions, encoded by size and opacity, enhancing the visualization's depth and interactivity. The subtitle aptly describes the aim of visualizing complex Hi-C data with matrix features and annotations.
