The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view showing genomic data from hg19. The circular view includes five tracks: an ideogram, a text annotation track titled "Putative Driver," two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and a link track illustrating structural variations. "Gain" and "LOH" are represented in sky blue and dark orange, respectively. The links between genomic positions use multiple colors, indicating various structural variations like Translocation and Duplication.

The linear view is linked to the circular view by chromosome 1, visualized in detail. It includes the ideogram, text annotations, and tracks for point mutations, insertions, deletions, and copy number variants. The "Point Mutation" scatter plot shows different mutation types with distinct colors. Range annotations for "Insertion" and "Deletion" are shown with different colors, and copy number variations are displayed as gray bars. This comprehensive visualization allows exploration of genomic alterations and their classifications.
