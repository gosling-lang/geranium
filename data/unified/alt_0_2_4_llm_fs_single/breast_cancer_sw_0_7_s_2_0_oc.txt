A linear view visualization of chromosome 1 from the hg38 assembly, featuring an ideogram with colored bands indicating different genomic stains. A gene annotation track displays directional triangles in two rows for gene strands: blue for positive and beige for negative. Below, two Copy Number Variation (CNV) tracks show data from a CSV file. The first track displays regions with zero minor tumor copy number in red rectangles. The second track highlights regions with a total copy number above 4.5 in green rectangles. At the base, a connection track illustrates structural variations with lines linking genomic positions, using colors like green, blue, red, and orange for different SV classes: tandem-duplication, translocation, deletion, and inversion.
