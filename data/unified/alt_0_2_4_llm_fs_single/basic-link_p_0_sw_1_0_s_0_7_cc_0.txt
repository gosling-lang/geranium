A linear layout visualization titled "Basic Marks: Link" demonstrates genomic connections within chromosome 1 using a CSV dataset. The links are visualized with arcs in red, representing segments between start and end genomic fields labeled 's1' and 'e1'. The visualization spans 560 units in width and 156 units in height, providing an interactive view with linking features aimed at depicting duplicated segments and structural rearrangements. The subtitle "Tutorial Examples" indicates its educational purpose.
