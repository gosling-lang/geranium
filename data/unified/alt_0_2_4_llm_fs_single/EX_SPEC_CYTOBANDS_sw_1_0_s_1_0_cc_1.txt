A series of linear visualizations display genomic data for five chromosomes (chr1 to chr5) in parallel tracks. Each chromosome track contains two layers: an area chart and an ideogram.

### Area Chart
- **Data Source**: Multivec file showing genomic positions across samples.
- **Marks**: Area, representing quantitative variations (peak values) along the genome.
- **X-axis**: Genomic positions on each chromosome.
- **Y-axis**: Quantitative peak values.
- **Colors**: Different colors represent samples (blue, orange, green, red) categorized under 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'.

### Ideogram
- **Data Source**: Cytogenetic banding data from a CSV file.
- **Marks**: Text, rectangles, and triangles overlaid on:
  - **Rectangles**: Represent the density of bands in gray-scale shades (from white to black) and purple for genomic variance regions.
  - **Text**: Labels bands with black text to indicate chromosomal features.
  - **Triangles**: Maroon triangles represent centromeric regions ('acen-1' and 'acen-2').

### Layout
- **Configuration**: Linear arrangement in horizontal orientation.
- **Style Attributes**: Gray strokes outline the genomic segments, adding clarity to delineated boundaries of genomic ranges. 

This visualization effectively communicates genomic density and variability across multiple chromosomes with a clear and informative layout.
