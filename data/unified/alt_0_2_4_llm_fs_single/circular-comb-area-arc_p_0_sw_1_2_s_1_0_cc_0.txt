This circular visualization consists of two distinct tracks: an area chart and a link track. The area chart, positioned on the left, displays data across the genome from chromosome 1, within the interval of 1 to 3,000,500. It visualizes four samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4') using multivec data, where each sample is represented by a distinct color. The areas are stratified in separate rows for each sample, creating a visual comparison of expression levels. The colors of the areas correspond to specific samples and include shades of blue, orange, green, and red.

The right track showcases a connection chart that uses CSV data to display within-link interactions on chromosome 1, spanning genomic positions from approximately 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. The connections are displayed with varying colors, indicating different segments of the chromosome. The opacity is set to create a semi-transparent effect, allowing for the overlapping connections to be clearly visible. Both tracks are styled with white strokes to separate segments, enhancing clarity.
