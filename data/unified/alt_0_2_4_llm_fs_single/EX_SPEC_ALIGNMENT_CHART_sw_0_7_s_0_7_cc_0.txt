A set of visualizations displays genomic data. The first chart, titled "Gap," is a bar chart showing gaps in a genomic interval from 350 to 396. Pink bars represent the gap values on the y-axis. The second chart, titled "Conservation," displays conservation scores within the same genomic interval. Yellow bars encode these scores on the y-axis, and their intensity corresponds to conservation levels. The third chart, aligned vertically, shows sequences with colored rectangles and text, stratified by categories, each associated with a different color denoting nucleotide bases. The final visualization is an overlaid chart, combining rectangles with genomic sequence data and two additional bar charts representing conservation and gap values as seen in the previous charts. This comprehensive layout provides an insightful look into alignment characteristics, gaps, and conservation across the specified genomic domain.
