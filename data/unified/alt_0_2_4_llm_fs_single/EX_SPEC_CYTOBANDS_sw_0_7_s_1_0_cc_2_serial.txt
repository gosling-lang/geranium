A series of linear area charts display genomic data across five chromosomes (chr1 to chr5) with an ideogram track below each chart. Each area chart visualizes a multivec file, showing data from four samples, with positions on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis. Colors are assigned to categories, such as blue, orange, green, and red. The ideogram tracks feature black and white rectangles indicating density, with additional purple, maroon right, and left triangles marking specific genomic features. The entire visualization is static and horizontally arranged in a serial layout.
