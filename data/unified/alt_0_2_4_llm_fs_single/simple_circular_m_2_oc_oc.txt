A circular visualization representing genomic data on chromosome 1, featuring two tracks. The outer track displays an area chart visualizing a multivec dataset, with samples 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The positions are encoded using the 'peak' field, with colors indicating different samples. The inner track shows a circular ideogram, using a CSV source, highlighting chromosome bands with varying shades to denote different stain categories. The layout is circular with a center radius of 0.6, offering a compact yet detailed genomic overview.
