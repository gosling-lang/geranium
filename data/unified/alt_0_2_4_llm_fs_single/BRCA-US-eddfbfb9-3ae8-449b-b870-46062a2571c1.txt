A circular and linear comparative view visualization displays genomic data on the hg19 assembly. The top circular view features five concentric tracks, including an ideogram and two range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)', shown as blue and red rectangles, respectively. A text annotation track, 'Putative Driver,' displays black text. The innermost track links genomic positions via arcs, colored by categories such as 'Translocation', 'Duplication', and 'Deletion.'

The linear view below presents chromosome 1, featuring similar tracks as the circular view with added detail. It includes a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation', where points represent mutation distances, colored by subtype such as 'C>T' and 'T>G'. A gene annotation track contains gray arrows indicating gene orientation. Additional tracks display rectangular annotations for insertions, deletions, and copy number variants. These are visualized as lines and rectangles across different categories, enriched by a fine level of detail, enhancing genomic interpretation. The interactive brush on the circular view seamlessly links to the corresponding linear sections, facilitating thorough exploration and analysis.
