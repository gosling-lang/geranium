The visualization consists of a circular ideogram and a linear view of chromosome data. The circular view features an ideogram with interactive brushing, allowing users to select genomic intervals linked to the linear view. Several circular tracks visualize data such as 'Putative Driver' with black text, and range annotations including 'Gain' (in sky blue) and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' (in dark orange). A line-connection track displays chromosomal translocations and other structural variants with different colors and strokes.

The linear view expands on chromosome 1, showing an ideogram and annotations such as 'Putative Driver' and 'Point Mutation' with a scatterplot, highlighting distances between mutations. Two additional range annotation tracks represent insertions and deletions in rectangles of different colors. A 'Copy Number Variants' track shows quantitative variations as gray bars. The connection track at the bottom visualizes structural variations between genomic positions, coded by color for categories like 'Duplication' and 'Inversion.'
