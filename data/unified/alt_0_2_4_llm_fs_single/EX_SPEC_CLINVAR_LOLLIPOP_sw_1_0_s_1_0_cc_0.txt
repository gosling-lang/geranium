The visualization presents three vertically arranged linear genome tracks, each providing a detailed view of different genomic intervals on chromosome 13. The tracks, marked as "HiGlass," showcase gene annotations with directional triangles and text labels indicating gene names. The first track spans 31,500,000 to 33,150,000 base pairs, while the second focuses on 32,000,000 to 32,700,000, and the third zooms further into 32,314,000 to 32,402,500.

Each track consists of two sections: a top section displaying blue and orange triangles, rectangles, and lines representing genes and exons differentiated by strand orientation, and a bottom section featuring variations in clinical significance. The clinical significance is visualized through bars and colored points, indicating categories such as "Pathogenic," "Likely pathogenic," and "Benign," among others. The color scheme differentiates categories, using shades like pink for "Pathogenic" and green for "Benign."

Opacity and size adjustments help manage visibility, allowing for detailed navigation and exploration of genetic variants. Interactive zoom levels offer a dynamic experience, adapting the granularity of the displayed data based on user interactions. This comprehensive view aids in analyzing genetic variations and their clinical implications across significant regions on chromosome 13.
