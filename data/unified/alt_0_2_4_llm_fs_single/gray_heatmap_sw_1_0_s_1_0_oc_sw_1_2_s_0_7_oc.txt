The visualization is a heat map displayed in a linear layout representing a matrix dataset. The genome of hg38 is plotted on both the x-axis and y-axis, showing intervals from chromosome 1 to chromosome Y on the x-axis and from chromosome 2 to chromosome 22 on the y-axis. The rectangles within the grid are coded with color intensity, with a grey color range indicating quantitative expression values. The layout is horizontal and the axes are aligned, with the x-axis positioned at the top and the y-axis on the left. The visualization is static, with no interactive features, and is assembled from data sourced from a matrix file. The chart dimensions are set to a width of 366 pixels and a height of 310 pixels.
