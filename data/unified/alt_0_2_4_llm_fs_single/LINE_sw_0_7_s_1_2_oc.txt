A line chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, displaying the entire genome of hg38. The position on the x-axis is encoded using the genomic field named 'position,' while the y-axis represents quantitative values from the field 'peak,' depicted as a continuous line. The title is 'Basic Marks: line,' and the subtitle is 'Tutorial Examples.' The thickness of the line is set to 2 units.
