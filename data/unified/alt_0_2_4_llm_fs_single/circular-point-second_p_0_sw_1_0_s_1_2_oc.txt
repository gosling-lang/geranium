A circular scatter plot displays genomic data from chromosome 1 within the interval 1 to 3,000,500. Each point represents genomic positions and expression values, where size and position encode the data field 'peak.' Points are color-coded to differentiate between four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The layout is static and circular with a center radius of 0.5, showing quantitative values on the y-axis with grid lines. The interactive tooltip reveals genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample categories.
