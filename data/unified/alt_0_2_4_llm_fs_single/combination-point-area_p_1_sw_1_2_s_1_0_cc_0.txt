A dual-track visualization in a linear layout illustrates genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The upper track features an area chart, segmented into rows by sample categories—'sample 1' through 'sample 4'—each represented by distinct colors (blue for sample 1, orange for sample 2, green for sample 3, and red for sample 4). This chart plots the 'peak' values across the genomic position on the x-axis, with corresponding y-axis values. The lower track displays a scatter plot of the same data, highlighting individual data points whose sizes and y-axis positions are determined by 'peak' values. The color differentiation remains consistent with the categories, enhancing visual clarity. The visualization includes interactive tooltips providing additional genomic details, offering an integrated perspective on data variations across samples.
