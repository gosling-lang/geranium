A circular visualization displays chromosome 1, spanning 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs, using hg38 assembly. The layout consists of two horizontal tracks: a heat map and a bar chart. The heat map on the left depicts genomic intervals with color intensity representing peak values, stratified into rows by four samples. The right track is a bar chart showing genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis, each sample represented by different colored bars. Both tracks feature interactive tooltips detailing start and end positions, peak values, and sample names.
