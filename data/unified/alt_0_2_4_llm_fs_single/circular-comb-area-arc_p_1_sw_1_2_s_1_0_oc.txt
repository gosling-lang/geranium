A circular visualization displays genomic data with two distinct tracks from chromosome 1 between base pairs 1 to 3,000,500. The left track features a connection chart where links represent genomic intervals coded by different colors. These connections illustrate large-scale genomic segments between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. The right track consists of an area plot, stratified by four samples, each represented by a unique color. The samples, labeled from 1 to 4, show the expression levels on the y-axis. This layout allows for a comprehensive view of genomic structure and sample-specific expressions.
