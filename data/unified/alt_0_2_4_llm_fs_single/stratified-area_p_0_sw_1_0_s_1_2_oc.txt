A multi-row area chart in a linear layout visualizes genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning from positions 1 to 3,000,500 of the hg38 assembly. Each row represents a different sample ('sample 1' to 'sample 4') and is colored uniquely for clarity. The genomic position is plotted on the x-axis with top-axis labeling, and quantitative expression values (peaks) are shown on the y-axis using filled areas. The chart is interactive, displaying detailed information via tooltips, and includes a legend for sample categories. The visual is styled with a white stroke separating areas, enhancing visual distinction.
