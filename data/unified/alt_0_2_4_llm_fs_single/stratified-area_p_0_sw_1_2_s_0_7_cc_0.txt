An area chart in a vertical linear layout visualizes a multivec file, representing chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 using the hg38 assembly. The chart uses an area mark to display quantitative data from the 'peak' field across four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each row represents a different sample, with colors blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The x-axis shows genomic positions, and a legend is provided to identify sample colors. The chart includes tooltips showing start and end genomic positions and peak values. The stroke of the area is white with a width of 0.5.
