A circular area chart visualizes a multivec file, highlighting chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart consists of multiple layers representing different sample categories, excluding "sample -", each displayed in a distinct color. The visualization showcases quantitative "peak" values as areas along the y-axis, divided into five different ranges for detailed observation: 0 to 0.01, 0 to 0.0025, 0.0025 to 0.005, 0.005 to 0.0075, and 0.0075 to 0.01. The chart is stratified by rows, and the circular layout enhances the perception of genomic patterns in the dataset, made reference to the study by Javed et al. on graphical perception of time series.
