A linear bar chart visualizing a multivec data file and JSON annotations. The chart is titled "Rule Mark" with the subtitle "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines." The data shows the hg38 genome, with "sample 1" as the category. The x-axis displays genomic intervals, and the y-axis shows quantitative values of the "peak" data field, ranging from 0 to 0.003. Bars in the chart are colored sky blue. Overlaid tracks use a rule mark to denote specified genomic positions with horizontal and vertical dashed lines, colored in sky blue and green, representing different quantitative references. Each rule's stroke width varies according to the associated quantitative value.
