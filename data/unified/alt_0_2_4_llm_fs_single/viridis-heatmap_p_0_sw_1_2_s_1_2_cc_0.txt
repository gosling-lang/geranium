The visualization is a heat map in a linear layout, displaying a multivec file from the genome of chromosome 1, covering an interval from 1 to 3,000,500. Rectangles represent the genomic intervals, which are colored according to the expression values of a data field named 'peak.' The color intensity is based on a quantitative scale, labeled with a "hot" color palette. The map is stratified by four rows labeled as 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4,' each representing different categories. The x-axis marks genomic positions, and tooltips provide detailed information for each section, including start and end positions within the chromosome and specific expression values.
