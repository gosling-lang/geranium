The visualization represents a heat map in a linear layout, displaying genomic data from a matrix file associated with hg38. The axes show genomic intervals on both the x and y dimensions, encoded with a rectangular mark. Color intensity, ranging from light to dark within a hot color scheme, represents quantitative expression values. The chart's title is 'HFFc6_Micro-C', and the overall dimensions are 294x420 units.
