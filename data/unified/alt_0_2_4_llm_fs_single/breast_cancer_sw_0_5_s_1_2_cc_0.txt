The visualization consists of five tracks arranged in a linear layout, displaying genomic data on chromosome 1. The first track is an ideogram using a CSV file with rectangles indicating different categories, while left and right triangles mark specific regions. The second track, a genomic position annotation track, utilizes BEDDB data, showing gene direction with blue right triangles for the '+' strand and orange left triangles for the '-' strand, with category-based color encoding. The third and fourth tracks are rectangle plots visualizing copy number variations from a CSV file. The third track highlights regions with a minor copy number of zero in tumor data, shown in pink rectangles, while the fourth track shows regions with a total copy number greater than 4.5 in purple rectangles. The final track displays genomic rearrangements from a CSV file, with connections illustrating different structural variations such as tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions, colored and stroked according to specific categories.
