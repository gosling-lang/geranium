The visualization combines a circular and linear view linked by an interactive brush. The circular view displays the entire genome with tracks, including ideogram, point annotation, range annotation titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' and line connections. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, reflecting the circular view's magnified section. It has similar tracks, a gene annotation track, a scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation,' and additional range annotations. Categories like 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion' are distinguished by color and stroke in the line-connection track.
