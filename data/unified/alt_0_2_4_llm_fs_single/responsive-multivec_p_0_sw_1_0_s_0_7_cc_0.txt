A multi-row bar chart visualizes a multivec file, showing the chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart displays data from samples 1 to 16, omitting specific samples. The bars, stratified by rows, represent genomic intervals on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis. Different colors indicate different sample categories. Visibility of data adapts responsively with the chart's height. The dataset originates from a graphical perception study on multiple time series, referenced in TVCG 2010.
