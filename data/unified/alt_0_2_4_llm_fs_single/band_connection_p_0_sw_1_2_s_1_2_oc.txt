A linear visualization representing segmental duplications using CSV data is displayed. This chart consists of multiple tracks, each featuring rectangular blocks and connection lines in shades of green. The visualization focuses on chromosome 1, displaying genomic intervals between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. The rectangles represent specific genomic regions, while the connections illustrate relationships between segments on each track. These segments and connections maintain a consistent green color theme, providing a visual coherence. The transparency effect, set at 15%, offers an overlay-like appearance between elements, enhancing the overall visualization clarity.
