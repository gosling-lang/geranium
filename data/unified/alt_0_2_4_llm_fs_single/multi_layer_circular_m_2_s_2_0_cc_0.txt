A circular area chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying chromosome 12 from positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The chart features rows of areas for different 'sample' categories: 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' 'sample 6,' 'sample 7,' and 'sample 8.' These areas are represented in distinct colors, including blue, orange, green, red, purple, and brown. The y-values represent 'peak' values, with areas filled within the range of 0 to 0.01. The layout follows a circular design, using data from hg38 assembly, facilitating a comprehensive genomic comparison.
