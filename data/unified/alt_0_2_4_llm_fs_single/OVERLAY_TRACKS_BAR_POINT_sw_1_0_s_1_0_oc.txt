A linear genomic visualization chart overlays bars and points, illustrating genetic significance across chromosome 3. Using a BEDDB data type, it maps genomic intervals on the x-axis and significance on the y-axis. The chart is approximately 800 pixels wide and 230 pixels tall. Categories for "significance" such as "Pathogenic" and "Benign" are color-coded, with pathogenic variants in shades of orange and likely benign in green. Baseline significance is "Uncertain," denoted in black. The visualization, titled "Example: Overlay Tracks," includes a legend and gridlines for clarity.
