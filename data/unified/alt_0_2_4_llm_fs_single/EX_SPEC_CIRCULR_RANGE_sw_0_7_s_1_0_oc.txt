The visualization is a circular bar chart representing genomic data. It uses a vector dataset to display the genome on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. The chart features a light yellow color for the bars and spans the entire hg38 genome. The layout is static, with a stack alignment and a center radius of 0.3, making the visualization concise and focused. Each bar's height represents quantitative values from the 'peak' field, highlighting genomic positions in a circular arrangement.
