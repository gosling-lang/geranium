The visualization is a heat map displaying genomic interactions in a linear layout using a matrix dataset. It covers genomic intervals from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 bases. Both the x-axis and y-axis represent genomic coordinates, with chr5 to chr10 labeled. The intensity of the gray color encodes the expression values, illustrating the interaction strength between genomic regions. It is set within the context of the hg38 genome assembly and is rendered in shades of gray. The heat map emphasizes regions of high interaction along the diagonal, indicative of intrachromosomal interactions.
