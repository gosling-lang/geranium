---

The visualization displays genomic features on chromosome 3 from 52,168,000 to 52,890,000 in a linear horizontal layout. It contains six different genomic range annotation tracks with diverse visual accentuation:

1. **Cyverse-QUBES**: This track overlays text annotations of gene names along with directional indications using right-facing and left-facing triangles for forward and reverse strands, respectively. It features light gray rectangles indicating gene structures, gray rules showing gene extents, and purple rectangles with a purple stroke representing exons.

2. **Generic Gene Track**: This track displays genomic annotations categorized into genes, exons, and introns. Genes are marked in dark gray, exons in bright red, and introns in cyan. The track is structured by strand categories.

3. **GmGDV**: This annotated track uses blue for forward strand elements and red for reverse strand ones. It incorporates text, triangles, and rectangles to depict gene names, their orientation, and exon structures. 

4. **HiGlass**: Implementing various forms of data encoding, HiGlass uses pastel blues and reds to denote different strands and displays gene names, triangles for directional cues, and rectangles for exon representation.

5. **IGV**: This track utilizes navy color to depict genomic annotations with markers indicating the start and end points of genes. Text annotations are integrated for gene names, with white-opacity patterns
