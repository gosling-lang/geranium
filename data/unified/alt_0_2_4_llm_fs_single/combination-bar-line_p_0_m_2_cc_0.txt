The visualization comprises two vertically arranged charts displaying genomic data across chromosome 1 within a range of 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. The top chart presents an area plot indicating expression values on the y-axis and genomic positions on the x-axis. Different samples are distinguished by colors: blue, orange, green, and red, representing 'sample 1' to 'sample 4,' respectively. 

The bottom chart features an overlay of area and bar plots. It visualizes the same genomic positions on the x-axis, stratified by rows for each sample. The area is plotted along with bars whose heights correspond to expression values. Colors remain consistent with those in the top chart, providing clear differentiation of samples. The charts incorporate tooltips to reveal detailed information about genomic positions, expression values, and sample categories, enhancing interactivity.
