The visualization is a linear pileup chart using BAM data, focused on chromosome 1 between positions 136,750 and 139,450. It features two tracks: a top bar chart showing coverage with gray bars, and a bottom track displaying reads as colored rectangles. The rectangles are segmented by rows representing various structural variations, such as 'normal read,' 'deletion (+-),' and 'inversion (++).' Each variation type is color-coded, including silver for 'normal read' and red for anomalies like 'mates not found within chromosome.' The chart includes a legend titled 'Insert Size = 300bp.'
