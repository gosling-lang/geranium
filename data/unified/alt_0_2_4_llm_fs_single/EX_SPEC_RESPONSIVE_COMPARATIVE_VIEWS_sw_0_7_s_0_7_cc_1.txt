**Description**: 

This visualization presents a set of three vertical bar charts arranged horizontally. Each chart displays genomic data from a multivec file across different chromosomes and intervals, specifically chromosomes 12 and 9. The x-axis represents genomic positions within intervals ranging from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The y-axis shows quantitative values corresponding to the 'peak' field. Data for each chromosome is shown using distinct color encoding: pink for the first chart and green for the second and third charts. The bars are outlined in white with a stroke width of 0.5. The charts showcase how expression levels vary along the genome for 'sample 1'. These views are designed responsively to adjust based on available width, maintaining a consistent height for data representation.
