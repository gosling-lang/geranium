The visualization is a scatter plot with a linear layout, displaying point mutations from a VCF file. The x-axis represents genomic positions across various chromosomes, specifically chromosome 2 and others notated as chr4, chr7, chr10, chr13, chr17, and chr27. The y-axis quantifies the log-transformed distance to the previous mutation. Each point in the scatter plot represents a mutation event, with colors distinguishing different mutation subtypes: C>A, C>G, C>T, T>A, T>C, and T>G. The legend on the right clearly indicates these categories. The subtitle, "Point mutations from a VCF file," succinctly describes the dataset focus. The plot is characterized by transparency in the data points, enhancing visibility of overlapping mutations, with a consistent opacity across all data points. The visualization is interactive, allowing for detailed exploration of genomic mutations.
