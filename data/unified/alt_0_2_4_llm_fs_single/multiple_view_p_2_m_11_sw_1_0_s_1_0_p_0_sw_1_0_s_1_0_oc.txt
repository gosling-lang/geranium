The visualization consists of a vertical arrangement of linked charts, demonstrating data from chromosome 1 using a multivec file alignment.

1. **Top Left: Linear Area Chart**
   - Displays genomic intervals on the x-axis with expression values shown in colored areas on the y-axis.
   - Rows represent categories 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each in different colors.
   - Includes interactive brushes to update other views, allowing users to select and focus on specific genomic regions.

2. **Top Right: Circular Line Chart**
   - Illustrates the same data in a circular layout, emphasizing the continuity of genomic data.
   - Lines correspond to the four categories, with sections of the genome highlighted interactively through brush links.

3. **Bottom: Linear Scatter Plot**
   - Focuses on a detailed view of chromosome 1 (160,000,000 to 200,000,000).
   - Displays points reflecting quantitative expression data on the y-axis stratified by category with corresponding colors.
   - The scatter plot is dynamically linked to the top views, providing detailed insight into the selected region.

Overall, this interactive visualization allows exploration and comparison of genomic data across different layout styles, enhancing the understanding of genomic expression patterns.
