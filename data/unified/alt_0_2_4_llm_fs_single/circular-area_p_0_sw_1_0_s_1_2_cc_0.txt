A circular layout displays multiple samples of genomic data using an area chart. The visualization encompasses chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500, showing quantitative peak values stratified by four samples. Each sample is distinctively colored: blue for 'sample 1,' orange for 'sample 2,' green for 'sample 3,' and red for 'sample 4'. The visualization effectively conveys genomic data with a top-oriented axis and informative tooltips, enhancing the interpretability of the sample data peaks.
