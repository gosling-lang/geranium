The visualization displays genomic data in a linear layout, focusing on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. It comprises two vertically arranged tracks. 

The top track is a multicolored line chart representing expression values. Each line corresponds to one of four samples, with colors denoting different categories. The x-axis shows the genomic positions, while the y-axis displays quantitative expression values.

The bottom track combines a scatter plot and an area chart. This track is stratified by sample categories, with areas and points representing expression levels and their heights indicating peak values. Points are color-coded by category, and the x-axis defines genomic positions.

Tooltips provide details about genomic position, peak values, and sample names. The layout employs the hg38 assembly with an interactive zoom capability, allowing detailed examination of genomic regions.
