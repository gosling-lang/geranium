The visualization showcases three interconnected charts using a brush for interactive detail linkage. On the top left, a linear area chart displays genomic data across chromosome 1, with intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. The chart is stratified by categories, using distinct colors for each. An interactive brush links to subsequent charts. On the top right, a circular line chart visualizes the same data in a radial format, maintaining the color stratification and genomic intervals on the x-axis. The bottom chart provides a detailed linear view over a specified interval on chromosome 1 (160,000,000 to 200,000,000), rendered as a scatter plot. Points represent expression values and colors denote categories, updating dynamically with the brush interaction. The title is "Visual Linking," and the subtitle emphasizes interactive adjustments to update the detail view.
