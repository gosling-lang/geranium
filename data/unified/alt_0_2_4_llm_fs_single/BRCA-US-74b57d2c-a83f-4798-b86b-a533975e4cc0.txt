The visualization consists of a circular view and a linear view stacked vertically. The circular view displays the entire genome, including an ideogram, and features an interactive blue brush linked to the linear view. The ideogram showcases genomic intervals with color-coded categories such as 'Gain' in sky blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in dark orange. A text track titled 'Putative Driver' and a line-connection track display variant classifications like 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' and 'Inversion' with varying line colors and strokes.

The linear view zooms into chromosome 1 from the circular view, featuring multiple tracks: an ideogram with triangles indicating centromeres, a 'Putative Driver' text track, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation,' two range annotation tracks for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' with distinct colors, and a track for 'Copy Number Variants' showing data in light grey rectangles. Various structural variations are depicted using links of different colors based on the category, enhancing the genomic exploration experience.
