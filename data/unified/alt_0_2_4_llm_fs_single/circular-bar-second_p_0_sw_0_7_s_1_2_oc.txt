A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file showing genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The layout is static with a vertical arrangement, and the chart is segmented into four concentric rings representing different samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is associated with a unique color to depict expression levels encoded in the 'peak' field. The inner radius is set to half the outer radius, optimizing visibility within the circular format. The x-axis represents the genomic position, and the y-axis encodes quantitative peak values. Tooltip support reveals details such as start and end positions, peak value, and sample designation. The assembly used is hg38.
