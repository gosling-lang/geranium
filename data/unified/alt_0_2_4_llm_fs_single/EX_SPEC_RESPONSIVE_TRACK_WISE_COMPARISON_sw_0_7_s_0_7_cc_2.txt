The visualization consists of genomic tracks arranged vertically, showing data from chromosomes 12 and 8. The top track displays gene annotations for chromosome 12, with genes and exons represented by green triangles and rectangles. Below, three bar charts for samples 1, 2, and 3 display genomic data as bars in purple and sky blue, indicating different expressions. Similarly, tracks for chromosome 8 show gene annotations in green, with corresponding bar charts for each sample below, displaying data with purple and green bars. Each section of the visualization is linked to its genomic interval through the x-axis, highlighting distinct features in the data.
