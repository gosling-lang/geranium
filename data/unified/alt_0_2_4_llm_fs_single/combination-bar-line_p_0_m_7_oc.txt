The visualization consists of two stacked tracks in a vertical linear layout, displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. The upper track is a scatter plot showing expression values with colorful points, each color representing a different category: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The x-axis denotes genomic positions, while the y-axis displays quantitative peak values. The lower track combines an area and line chart, stratified by sample categories, with colors matching the scatter plot. The lines depict quantitative peaks, with the areas highlighting differences in expression across samples. Both tracks use interactive tooltips to provide genomic start and end positions, along with peak values.
