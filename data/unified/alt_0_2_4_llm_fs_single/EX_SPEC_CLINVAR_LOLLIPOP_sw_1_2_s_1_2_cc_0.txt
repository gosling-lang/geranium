The visualization consists of three linear views arranged vertically, each focused on chromosome 13 across specified genomic intervals. Each view contains an annotation track and a significance track.

**Gene Annotation Tracks:**
- Display gene structures with directionality using triangles, text labels, and exons as rectangles.
- The strand is encoded with color: blue for positive and orange for negative.
- A rule pattern indicates gene orientation, with varied line patterns for strands.

**Significance Tracks:**
- Present ClinVar data with a combination of bars and points.
- Bar chart encodes significance levels such as "Pathogenic" and "Likely benign" with colors and height.
- Points show individual data entries positioned along the x-axis according to genomic start.
- Data adapted dynamically based on zoom level, offering varying insights at different resolutions.

The visualization allows examination of gene structures and ClinVar significance, providing insights with interactive zoom-dependent details.
