The visualization consists of five linear tracks aligned horizontally. The first track is an ideogram showing chromosome 1 with various stain categories, including gneg, gpos, and acen, represented in different colors. The second track is a genomic position annotation track displaying gene locations using triangles to indicate strand direction; strands are colored blue for positive and beige for negative. The third track features orange rectangles representing areas with zero minor copy number in tumor cells, while the fourth track shows green rectangles depicting regions with a total copy number in tumors higher than 4.5. The fifth track visualizes structural variations with connections between genomic positions, color-coded for different structural variation classes such as tandem-duplication and translocation. The interactive design allows for exploration of genomic features in this linear layout.
