A linear layout visualization showcases overlayed tracks, presenting multivec data for chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The visualization uses both line and point marks to represent expression values, with each sample displayed on separate rows. The position is shown on the x-axis, while the y-axis encodes the 'peak' values quantitatively. The point size varies based on the 'peak' value, ranging from 0 to 6. The chart distinguishes four samples using distinct colors for both lines and points: orange, green, blue, and purple. The title of the visualization is "Example: Overlayed Tracks," indicating its function to demonstrate multiple data series within a unified view.
