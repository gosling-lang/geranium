The visualization consists of three vertically arranged genomic range annotation tracks, covering chromosome 3 from position 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. 

1. **HiGlass Track**: Shows gene annotations with text labels. Genes on the '+' strand are depicted with blue right-facing triangles and lines, while '-' strand genes use orange left-facing triangles and lines. Exons are shown as rectangles.

2. **IGV Track**: Displays similar annotations as HiGlass but in a purple hue. Here, text labels indicate gene names, while rectangles and lines represent their positions and orientations.

3. **Corces et al. Track**: Mirrors the above annotations with smaller font sizes and employs a combination of blue and orange colors for '+' and '-' strand genes, respectively. Exons are marked as rectangles and gene paths as lines.

Each track is stratified by strand, and the color scheme provides categorical differentiation.
