A linear view with three tracks visualizes genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The first track is a bar chart displaying expression levels with color-coded categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4.' The second track overlays a line chart and scatter plot, depicting expression trends and individual points in various colors, stratified into rows based on sample categories. The third track showcases an area chart, filled with color for each sample level. Each track includes tooltips detailing genomic positions and values, enhancing data interaction and exploration.
