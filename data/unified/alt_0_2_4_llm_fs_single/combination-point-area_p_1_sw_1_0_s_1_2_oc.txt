A linear genomic visualization displays two vertically arranged tracks focused on chromosome 1 from base positions 1 to 3,000,500 of the hg38 assembly. The top track is an area chart stratified by four samples, each colored differently. It shows the peak values along the y-axis and is encoded by the area under the curve. The bottom scatter plot presents the same genomic positions on the x-axis but showcases peak values with points whose sizes vary according to the quantitative peak data. Both tracks use colors to represent different samples and include tooltips for interactive data inspection.
