The visualization showcases genomic data using a linear layout with two main regions. The first region, titled "hg38 | Transcript (Max. 15 Rows)," spans chromosome 3 between positions 142,500,000 and 143,000,000. It uses displacement to manage overlapping marks, depicting genes with directional arrows and text annotations in blue and orange, based on the strand orientation. Exons are represented by rectangles. This track maximizes visibility within set genomic intervals.

The second section focuses on chromosome 2, titled "Likely Benign," covering positional intervals between 126,800,000 and 127,700,000. It features points, text, and connections illustrating variants classified as likely benign. The points are green, and the associated connections are in light blue, linking corresponding genomic sites. This view uses color to differentiate variants and annotations across tracks to show genomic positions and categories.

The visualization also covers chromosome 17 (43,080,000 to 43,120,000), where points are colored based on pathogenic significance, ranging from likely pathogenic to benign. The entire visualization employs color-coding for clarity, with varying opacities to maintain visual hierarchies and ensure elements are distinct and informative.
