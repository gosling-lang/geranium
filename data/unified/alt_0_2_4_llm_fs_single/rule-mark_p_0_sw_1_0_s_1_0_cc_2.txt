This visualization is a composite chart titled "Rule Mark," featuring an annotated bar chart with horizontal and vertical lines. The main track is a bar chart showing genomic intervals on the x-axis, with expression values on the y-axis, represented by green bars. Overlayed are two tracks with lines: one displays both horizontal and vertical lines, where expression values are shown on the y-axis with varying stroke widths, colored in pink; the other exhibits vertical lines in sky blue. The data is processed using a multivec file linked to specific genomic positions on hg38 assembly. The chart uses a dashed styling pattern for elements like the lines, enhancing the annotation functionality with clear visual delineations.
