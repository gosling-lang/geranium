The linear visualization shows genomic intervals on chromosome 1, ranging from positions 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. It consists of seven tracks: four rectangle tracks and three connection tracks. The rectangles represent different genomic segments, with colors including green, purple, sky blue, and pink. The connection tracks visually link segments within the genome using lines, which are colored either sky blue or green, signifying relationships between these segments. The genomic data is sourced from a CSV file and formatted for hg38 assembly. The opacity, stroke width, and colors are consistent across tracks to distinguish the various elements visually.
