A visualization with a circular and a linear view arranged vertically. The circular view depicts the entire hg19 genome as an ideogram with interactive features. It includes a "Gain" track in blue and a "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" track in orange, with connections between genomic regions. The circular view connects to the linear view using a brush, zooming into chromosome 1. The linear view features a range of data tracks: a detailed ideogram, "Putative Driver" and "Point Mutation" annotations, and genetic variations like insertions, deletions, copy number variants, and structural variants. Colors differentiate categories such as gain, loss, translocation, duplications, deletions, and inversions. The layout integrates comprehensive data visualization, facilitating mutation and genomic feature analysis.
