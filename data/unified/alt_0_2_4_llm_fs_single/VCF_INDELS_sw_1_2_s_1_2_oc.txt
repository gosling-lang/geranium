This visualization presents a linear layout of insertions and deletions identified from a VCF file, covering multiple chromosomes including chr1, chr3, chr5, chr7, chr10, chr16, and chr21. The chart utilizes rows to distinguish between the 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' categories, marked with rectangles. Insertions are represented by yellow rectangles, while deletions are depicted in green. Data is overlaid using text annotations indicating the type of mutation, formatted as a concatenation of reference and alternate bases (REF â†’ ALT). The background is set to a light gray for improved contrast, and transparency is applied to the elements for a clearer visual impact.
