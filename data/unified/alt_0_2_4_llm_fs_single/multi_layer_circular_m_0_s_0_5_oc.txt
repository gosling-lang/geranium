A multi-row scatter plot in a circular layout visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The eight rows are named 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 6', 'sample 7', and 'sample 8', each represented by distinct colors. The data points reflect the 'peak' values, with no axis displayed for quantitative values. This circular scatter plot is designed to emphasize the distribution and intensity of genomic annotations across the specified chromosome interval.
