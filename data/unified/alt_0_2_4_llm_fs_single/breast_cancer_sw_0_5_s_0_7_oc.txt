The visualization is a multi-track linear layout representing genomic data across chromosome 1 of the hg38 assembly. The first track is an ideogram, illustrating cytogenetic bands with colors representing different stains. The segments include rectangular blocks with left and right triangles that indicate the centromeres. The second track displays gene annotations, showing genomic positions with markers for positive and negative strands, colored in grey and tan respectively.

The third track is a range annotation track using CSV data that highlights genomic regions with minor copy number variations (CNVs) in a tumor sample, marked in dark orange rectangles. The fourth track visualizes total CNVs above a threshold, illustrated with green rectangles. The final track is an overlay chart presenting structural variations with connections, displaying different rearrangements such as tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions, styled with varying colors for each structural class.
