A circular scatter plot visualizes a multivec data set across chromosome 12, spanning positions from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The plot utilizes a point mark for the 'peak' data field, displayed in a circular layout. The genomic positions are represented on the x-axis, and the peak values are on the y-axis. The data is stratified in rows by 'sample' categories, with each category depicted by distinct colors, facilitating comparison across 16 'sample' categories. The plot features multiple layers corresponding to different value domains of the 'peak' data, with opacity varied across layers to highlight distinct value ranges. The circular design emphasizes the peripheral mapping of genomic positions, allowing for easy identification of data patterns and correlations in a visually compact format.
