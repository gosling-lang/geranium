A multi-track linear visualization shows genomic data for chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track overlays a line chart and bar chart, displaying quantitative peaks for four samples in distinct colors across genomic positions. Categories are represented by rows, with line and bar colors indicating different samples. The bottom track presents a scatter plot, with data points colored according to sample categories. This plot visualizes expression values along the y-axis and genomic positions on the x-axis, providing a comprehensive view of genomic variability.
