A heat map in a linear layout visualizes a matrix file, displaying genomic intervals ranging from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 base pairs. The x-axis represents genomic positions from multiple chromosomes, while the y-axis shows corresponding paired genomic intervals. The color intensity encodes quantitative values, using a gradient from light yellow to dark red. The data is rendered as rectangles indicating levels of expression or interaction, utilizing an 'hg38' genomic assembly.
