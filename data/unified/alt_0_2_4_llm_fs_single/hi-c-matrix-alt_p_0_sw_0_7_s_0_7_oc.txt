A Hi-C matrix visualization in a linear layout displays genomic data from a matrix file, encompassing genomic intervals between 800,000,000 and 1,800,000,000. The matrix plot is colored based on quantitative values, with a grey scale. Vertical red and horizontal blue genome-wide annotations highlight significant areas. Points and bars in different overlays indicate specific genomic positions and values. The visualization is titled "Hi-C Matrix" with the subtitle "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations."
