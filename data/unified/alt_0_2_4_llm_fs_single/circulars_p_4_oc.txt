A circular layout visualization titled "Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts" showcases various visual encoding methods using the genome of chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The visualization consists of multiple horizontal views, each employing different graphic marks such as rectangles, bars, points, and line connections.

The first view is a circular heat map utilizing a multivec dataset. It displays expression values through color intensity, organized into rows based on samples labeled from 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'. 

Subsequent views include circular bar charts showing genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. The bars are colored according to sample categories.

A combined line and point chart highlights peaks with lines and corresponding points, where the size represents expression values. 

In another view, a scatter plot uses points to display genomic data. Here, color denotes the sample categories, and point size represents expression magnitude.

The visualization concludes with an area chart illustrating data of four samples and a connection chart that links genomic positions with arcs colored to reflect different data divisions. All tracks include tooltips providing detailed data insights.

This visualization effectively demonstrates circular layout capabilities in encoding genomic data through diverse graphical representations.
