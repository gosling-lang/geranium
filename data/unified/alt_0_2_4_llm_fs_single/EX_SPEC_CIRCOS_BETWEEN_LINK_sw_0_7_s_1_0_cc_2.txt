The visualization titled "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements" uses a circular layout to depict genomic data of the hg38 assembly. It comprises multiple tracks in a stacked alignment. The outermost track is a bar chart, illustrating quantitative data, with a green hue representing specific data points. Within, an ideogram displays chromosomal bands with colors coded according to stain types. The visualization also includes linkage tracks showing connections between genomic positions. These links are colored in shades of gray and black, signifying different chromosomal connections. The interactive chart presents a comprehensive view combining structural details and linkage patterns across genomic intervals in a visually engaging manner.
