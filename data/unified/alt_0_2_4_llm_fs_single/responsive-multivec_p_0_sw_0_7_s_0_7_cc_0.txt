The given visualization is a multivec bar chart in a linear layout, illustrating genomic data from chromosome 12 spanning intervals between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. It leverages a responsive design, adjusting dynamically with height changes. The data is filtered to exclude certain samples and portrays multiple categories across samples 1 through 16 with distinct colors including blue, orange, green, and purple. Dynamic visibility toggles according to track height, showing variable levels of data concentration with transparency changes. This chart aids in understanding the distribution and intensity of peak values across different samples, providing insight into genomic research findings. The chartâ€™s reference is drawn from Javed et al., highlighting graphical perception in multiple time series from TVCG 2010.
