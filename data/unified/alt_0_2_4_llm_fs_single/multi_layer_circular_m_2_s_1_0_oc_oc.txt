A circular area chart visualizes a multivec file, displaying genomic data for chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart has multiple concentric rings, each representing histone modification data from eight samples. Rows correspond to different samples, excluding "sample -". The area height within each ring represents a quantitative measure of peak intensity, ranging from 0 to 0.01. Each ring is uniquely colored to distinguish the samples. The visualization utilizes a circular layout with interactive features, focusing on the specified genomic position in the hg38 assembly.
