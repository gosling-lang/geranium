A linear area chart visualizes a multivec file across the entire genome of hg38. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis encodes the quantitative 'peak' values. The chart is titled 'Basic Marks: area' and features a subtitle 'Tutorial Examples'. The area is filled with a constant size of 2, creating a continuous visual display of intensity. The chart has a height of 210 and a width of 560, with chromosomes axes labeled at the bottom.
