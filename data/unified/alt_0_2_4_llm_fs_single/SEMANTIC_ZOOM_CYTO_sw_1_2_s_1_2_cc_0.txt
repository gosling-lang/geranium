The visualization is a semantic zooming ideogram of the human genome (hg38) displayed in a linear layout. Each chromosome is represented as a rectangular track, with colors indicating different chromosomal bands: white for gneg, shades of gray for gpos (light to dark), and light blue for gvar. The title "Example: Semantic Zooming" indicates that additional details, such as text and triangular shapes marking centromeres, become visible upon zooming in. The interactive feature allows users to view chromosomal details by adjusting the zoom level, with certain texts and features becoming visible at higher resolutions. Triangles are used to denote acrocentric chromosomes, colored maroon for both q (right triangle) and p (left triangle) arms. The chart is designed for dynamic exploration of genomic data, enhancing detail visibility based on zoom level.
