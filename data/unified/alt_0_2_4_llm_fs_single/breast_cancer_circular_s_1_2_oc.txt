A circular visualization composed of four distinct tracks illustrates genomic data from the hg38 assembly. The outermost track displays a circular ideogram with different chromosomal bands, where colors represent various staining categories such as "gneg" (white) and "acen" (red). The next track depicts genomic regions with a focus on cancer-related data. Rectangles in dark orange show regions of 'minor copy number in tumors' with a value of 0, while green rectangles highlight 'total copy number in tumors' within the range of 4.5 to 900. The innermost track presents a network of connections, representing structural variants across the genome. Categories such as "tandem-duplication" and "translocation" are encoded with specific colors and strokes, including "#569C4D" for tandem duplications and "#4C75A2" for translocations. The layout facilitates the comparison of chromosomal rearrangements, revealing complex interactions and mutations.
