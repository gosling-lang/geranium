The visualization depicts a linear layout showcasing genomic connections using a CSV file. The data consists of genomic intervals from chromosome 1, represented by arcs linking two genomic positions, with each arc colored in light red. This visualization, titled "Basic Marks: Link," is set in the genome assembly hg38, spanning a width of 960 pixels and a height of 210 pixels. The genomic intervals are laid out horizontally along the x-axis, divided into sections corresponding to specific regions on chromosome 1. This illustrative structure highlights the relational dynamics within the chromosome, enhanced by the visualization's interactive capabilities.
