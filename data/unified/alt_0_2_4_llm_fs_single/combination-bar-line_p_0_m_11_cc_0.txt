A linear, vertical arrangement displays genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The visualization consists of two tracks. The top track is a multicolored bar chart showing 'peak' values across four sample categories: sample 1 (blue), sample 2 (orange), sample 3 (green), and sample 4 (red). This track features genomic position on the x-axis and quantitative 'peak' values on the y-axis. The bottom track employs an overlay technique, where an area plot displays the same sample categories with stack heights representing peak values. The chart is divided by rows for each sample category. Tooltips provide supplementary data, including start and end positions and peak values for genomic intervals. The visualization uses a multivec dataset and includes interactive legends for the categories.
