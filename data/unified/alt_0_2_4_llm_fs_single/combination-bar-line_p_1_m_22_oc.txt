A visualization in a linear layout presents genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The upper chart combines a scatter plot and line plot, using points and lines to convey 'peak' values across four samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'). Each category is distinguished by color, and the line size reflects the magnitude of expression values. The lower chart is a scatter plot showing expression values for the same samples, where each point's color indicates the sample category. Both charts use the genomic position as the x-axis and overlay a tooltip for detailed exploration of genomic data, including position, value, and sample information.
