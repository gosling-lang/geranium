A bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart represents data across multiple categories, with each category displayed as a distinct colored bar. Visibility and opacity of the bars vary based on the track height, changing the domain of the 'peak' field across different thresholds. The visualization is responsive in height, adapting its size based on viewer constraints.
