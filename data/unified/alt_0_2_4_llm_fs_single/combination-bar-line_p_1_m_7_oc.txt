This visualization displays a linear layout consisting of two vertically arranged tracks focused on chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is an overlay of line charts, stratified by the category 'sample,' which includes four samples. The x-axis represents genomic positions while the y-axis displays quantitative 'peak' values. The lines are color-coded according to their sample category, with different line sizes reflecting the 'peak' values. The bottom track is a scatter plot, also stratified by the 'sample' category. The x-axis represents genomic positions, and the y-axis shows 'peak' values. Points are colored to indicate different categories, enhanced with grid lines for precise observation. Both tracks feature interactive tooltips for additional data insights.
