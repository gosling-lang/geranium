The visualization comprises two linear charts in a vertical arrangement, representing genomic data on chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top chart is a line chart where four samples—'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'—are plotted as separate rows. Each line's color corresponds to its sample, and the x-axis denotes genomic positions, while the y-axis shows expression values. Tooltip interactions offer details for each sample, position, and value. The bottom chart is an area chart with overlapping colored regions representing the same four samples. It highlights combined expression data across the chromosome, with colors corresponding to each sample. Both charts are set to a width of 600 pixels and showcase separate visual encoding styles: lines for the first chart and areas for the second.
