This visualization in a linear layout represents genomic data using multiple tracks. The display focuses on chromosome 1, specifically between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000 of the hg38 assembly. It includes tracks with bars and lines connecting genomic intervals. The rectangles, colored in sky blue and purple, depict the start and end positions along two regions of the chromosome. Connections, shown as pink and sky blue links, represent relationships between these genomic intervals. The interactive elements, such as opacity and styling features, enhance the clarity and emphasis on genomic overlaps and links.
