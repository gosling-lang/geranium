The visualization consists of two views: a circular and a linear view. The circular view, with a blue interactive brush, displays the entire human genome (hg19) as an ideogram, allowing exploration of specific genomic regions. Within this view, several tracks depict data: an ideogram colored by staining patterns, a point annotation track titled "Putative Driver" with text labels, and two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" (sky blue) and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" (dark orange). A connections track visualizes structural variations classified as 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion', with each category distinguishable by a specific color.

The linear view corresponds to chromosome 1, synchronizing with the circular view via a blue brush. This view includes an ideogram with chromosome bands, a gene annotation track with gene names and exon structures, and a "Point Mutation" scatter plot where mutations are colored based on their subtype ('C>A', 'C>G', 'C>T', 'T>A', 'T>C', 'T>G'). Two additional range annotation tracks show 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' events, and a "Copy Number Variants" track visualizes quantitative copy number data with gray bars. The entire setup is designed for interactive exploration of genomic features, providing detailed insights into genomic variations and potential mutation drivers.
