A visualization in a vertical linear layout displays two tracks, showcasing genomic data from chromosome 1, between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The top track is a bar chart, representing ‘peak_min’ and ‘peak_max’ values as bars stratified by samples 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4,' each distinguished by unique colors. The bottom track displays an area chart, visualizing the ‘peak’ values as colored areas corresponding to the same samples. Both tracks use genomic coordinates on the x-axis and quantitative values on the y-axis. The charts are enhanced with tooltips, stroke details, and legends for clarity.
