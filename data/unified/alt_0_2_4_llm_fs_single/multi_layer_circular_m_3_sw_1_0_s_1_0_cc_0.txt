A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file showing the chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The data is organized into multiple samples, excluding one with a placeholder name. Each sample is represented as a ring in the circular layout, differentiated by color, with colors selected from a diverse palette. The bars depict genomic intervals on the x-axis, with expression levels indicated on the y-axis. The visualization incorporates several opacity-based tracks, facilitating the discernment of expression level ranges within a domain. The circular design emphasizes the graphical perception of multiple time series as discussed in Javed et al.'s study, enhancing the intuitive understanding of data variation across genomic positions.
