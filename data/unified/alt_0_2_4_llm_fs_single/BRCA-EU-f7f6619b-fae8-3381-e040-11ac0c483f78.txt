The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view, arranged vertically and linked by a blue interactive brush. The circular view presents the entire hg19 genome, while the linear view focuses on chromosome 1. The circular view includes an ideogram, a text annotation track titled 'Putative Driver,' two range annotation tracks labeled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' with blue and orange rectangles respectively, and a connection track showing structural variations. These variations link genomic positions with colors representing 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' 'Inversion (TtT),' and 'Inversion (HtH).' The linear view mirrors the circular view with additional tracks: a gene annotation track, a scatterplot labeled 'Point Mutation' displaying VCF data—where points represent mutations by distance with colors indicating 'SUBTYPE'—and a range track for 'Copy Number Variants,' showcasing total copy number data in grey bars.
