A circular line and point chart arranged vertically visualizes a multivec file, displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The chart features four rows corresponding to 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4,' each shown with distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The lines represent genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peaks on the y-axis. Points are overlaid, with their size also indicating the peak values. This chart allows comparison of quantitative genomic data between different samples.
