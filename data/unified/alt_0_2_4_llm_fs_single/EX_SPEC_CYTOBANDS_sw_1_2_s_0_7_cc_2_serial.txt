The visualization features a linear genomic layout that consists of multiple tracks for five chromosomes, namely chr1 to chr5. Each track represents two visualizations overlaid on each other. The first visualization is an area chart depicting quantitative genomic data from a multivec file, representing expression levels. Different samples are represented using varied colors like blue, orange, green, and red. The second visualization is an ideogram showing the corresponding chromosome's cytogenetic bands. The bands are depicted with rectangles shaded in gray tones, while specific regions like "acen" are highlighted using red triangles. Text labels represent genomic bands, displayed in black if space allows. This static arrangement uses a consistent width across tracks, maintaining visual coherence.
