A composite visualization with a circular overview and two detailed linear views is displayed. The circular view has two stacked tracks. The first track shows genomic data from a multivec file across all chromosomes, stratified into four samples. Each sample is represented by rows with bars indicating expression levels, colored differently for each sample. Blue and red interactive brushes are applied to the x and y-axes, linking to the detailed views. The second track reveals genomic rearrangements with connections between selected chromosomes, classified by type (deletion, inversion, translocation, tandem-duplication), and colored strokes differentiating the categories.

Below the circular chart are two linear bar chart panels. The left panel focuses on chromosome 5, while the right panel highlights chromosome 16. Both panels utilize data from the same multivec file, displaying expression levels in a similar multi-sample format. Each sample's color is consistent, and the panels provide a more detailed view through the use of linked interactive brushes stemming from the circular chart.
