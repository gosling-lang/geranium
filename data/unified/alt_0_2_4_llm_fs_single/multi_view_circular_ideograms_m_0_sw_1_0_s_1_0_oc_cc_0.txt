A circular visualization combines a scatter plot with an ideogram, both set in a circular layout. The outer track represents a scatter plot where points illustrate the expression values across chromosome 1, arranged along the genomic position. Points are colored in categories such as blue, orange, green, and red. The inner track presents an ideogram displaying chromosome bands, with colors indicating specific staining types for categories like gneg, gpos25, gpos50, and others. The layout emphasizes genomic features using position and color dimensions, facilitating an integrated view of genetic and expression data. The center radius is 0.6, integrating data layers effectively within the circular plot.
