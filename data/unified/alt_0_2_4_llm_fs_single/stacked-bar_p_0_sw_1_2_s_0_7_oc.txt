A vertically arranged bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, showing data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. Different samples are visualized as overlapping colored layers, with categories 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', each represented in unique colors. The x-axis represents genomic positions, with values labeled at intervals, and the y-axis displays peak expression values. A legend on the right indicates colors associated with each sample category, enhancing interpretable data representation.
