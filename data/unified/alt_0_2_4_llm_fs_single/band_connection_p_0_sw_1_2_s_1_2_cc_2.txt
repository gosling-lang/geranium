A linear visualization displaying three sets of genomic intervals on chromosome 1, ranging from 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. The visualization showcases a series of rectangular bars and connection lines. The rectangular bars are colored in purple, green, and pink, representing different genomic segments. The blue connection lines illustrate overlaps or duplications between these segments across the tracks. The line thickness and color intensity vary, designating the level of overlap, with opacity set at 0.15. This visualization uses CSV data files to depict the genomic fields and supports interactive tooltip details indicating start and end positions.
