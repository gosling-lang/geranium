A linear genomic visualization for chromosome 1 displays five tracks. The top track, an ideogram, shows chromosomal bands with various category colors, including blues, oranges, and greens. Triangle annotations indicate gene strands, with blue for forward and orange for reverse. The third track indicates genomic loss with green bars, while the fourth track represents gain with pink bars. The bottom track features arcs connecting genomic rearrangements, with colors indicating different structural variation classes such as tandem-duplication and translocation.
