A circular scatter plot visualizes genomic data from chromosome 12, spanning positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. Points represent expression values, stratified by multiple samples arranged radially. Each sample, colored distinctly, reflects quantitative values on the radial axis. The visualization includes opacity variations across five layers, enhancing the visibility of peak intensities. The chart is based on multivec files and features a comprehensive color range, without a visible legend. The reference is Javed et al., focusing on the graphical perception of multiple time series as documented in TVCG 2010.
