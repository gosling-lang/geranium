A circular visualization with three stacked tracks demonstrates genomic relationships. The first track is a bar chart, displaying genomic data with peaks encoded as bars around the circle, colored green. The second track is an ideogram, illustrating chromosome data with colored rectangles representing different staining categories. The third track shows connections using within-link marks, visualizing genomic linkages in purple lines. The visualization, titled "Circos," is static, arranged in a circular layout, based on the hg38 assembly. It aligns the various data tracks using the position field as the central connecting attribute, effectively depicting complex genomic interactions.
