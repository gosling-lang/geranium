The visualization is a circular scatter plot displaying genomic data for chromosome 12, ranging from positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The plot is structured with color-coded points representing various sample categories. Expression values are mapped to the y-axis, stratified across rows for each category. An interactive arrangement allows exploration of multiple samples with transparency levels indicating overlapping data points. This chart references "Graphical perception of Multiple Time Series" by Javed et al. and aims to enhance visual insights into the varied genomic expressions.
