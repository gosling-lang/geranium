A circular bar chart displays genomic data from chromosome 1, covering positions from 1 to 3,000,500. The chart is organized with two rows representing 'sample 1' and 'sample 2.' Each sample is shown in distinct colors: blue for 'sample 1' and orange for 'sample 2.' Bars on the chart depict expression values, with the position on the x-axis and peak range on the y-axis. Tooltips provide detailed information about genomic positions and values. The chart includes a legend indicating the sample names and colors, surrounded by a black stroke for clarity.
