A vertical genomic visualization consisting of two linear tracks displays data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The top track is a heat map that presents expression values using color intensity, stratified by rows representing categories named 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The color scale ranges from light to dark, indicating lower to higher value intensities. Below, a bar chart illustrates expression on the y-axis with colored bars. Each bar's color corresponds to the distinct category of samples, shown in blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. Both tracks include tooltips displaying genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample categories.
