The visualization displays a matrix plot with two overlaid tracks highlighting genomic data on chromosome 10. This linear arrangement uses color intensity to depict quantitative values. The first matrix, covering the lower-left section, is shaded in pink, while the second, occupying the upper-right, is in grey. Both matrices illustrate genomic intervals on the x- and y-axes, which are marked at significant positions. The color gradient indicates varying expression levels, as shown in the embedded legends. Responsive design parameters ensure adaptability, maintaining clarity regardless of scale, within a coordinated genomic context between 50,000,000 and 100,000,000 positions on the chromosome.
