A circular heatmap visualizes a multivec file, showing the chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 on the hg38 assembly. The heatmap is arranged vertically with rows corresponding to different samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Color intensity encodes peak values, with a gradient range representing quantitative differences. The visualization is titled "Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts" with the subtitle "Heatmap." Each segment provides tooltip details showing genomic start and end positions, peak value, and sample name. The layout emphasizes data stratification by categories through both color and spatial arrangement.
