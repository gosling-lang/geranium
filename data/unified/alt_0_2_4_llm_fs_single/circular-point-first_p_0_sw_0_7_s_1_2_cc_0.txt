A circular scatter plot visualizes genomic data from four samples over a section of chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The chart contains points representing expression values, with point size corresponding to the magnitude of expression. It is colored by sample category, with individual colors assigned to each sample. The arrangement is vertical, and the layout is circular with a center radius of 0.5. The visualization, displayed in a static mode, enables tooltip interactions showing genomic start and end positions, value, and sample information.
