The visualization is a circular bar chart that displays genomic data from chromosome 12, spanning from positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. It uses a multivec dataset, with categories representing different samples. Each sample is represented as a separate row, with colors indicating different samples and their expression levels. The chart features multiple layers with varying opacities to depict different data domains. Bars are stratified by rows, with expression values shown on the y-axis and genomic intervals on the x-axis. The chart's reference is from a study on graphical perception of multiple time series by Javed et al., TVCG 2010.
