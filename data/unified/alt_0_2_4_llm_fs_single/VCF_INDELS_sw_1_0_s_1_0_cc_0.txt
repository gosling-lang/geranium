This visualization is a linear genomic plot representing insertions and deletions from a VCF file. Two rows categorize these mutations: 'Insertion' and 'Deletion.' Each row displays colored rectangles, with orange indicating insertions and green for deletions. The layout spans several chromosomes, including chr1, chr3, chr5, chr7, chr9, chr12, chr18, and chrX. The plot's interactive features adjust visibility based on zoom level, offering detailed mutation labels as you zoom in. The chart's background is light gray, aiming for clarity and simplicity in presenting genomic variations.
