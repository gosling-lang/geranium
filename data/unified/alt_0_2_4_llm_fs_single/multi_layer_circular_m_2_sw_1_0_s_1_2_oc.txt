The visualization is a circular area chart displaying genomic data from the multivec file, covering chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. Multiple samples are visualized as concentric rings, with each ring representing a distinct sample. The data are color-coded per sample, and the height of the area depicts quantitative values from the 'peak' field. The chart is stratified into various rows based on quantitative domains to highlight variations within the genomic intervals. No legend is displayed, but the area opacity varies across domains, offering a detailed visual representation of the data distribution in different samples. The reference for this visualization is Javed et al.'s study on multiple time series' graphical perception.
