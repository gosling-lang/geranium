The visualization is a scatter plot arranged in a linear layout displaying data from a multivec file. It shows chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. Points represent expression values plotted on both the y-axis and size axis, encoded by the 'peak' data field. The x-axis displays genomic positions, and points are colored by samples, highlighting different categories like 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each point's color corresponds to a specific sample category, enhancing distinction. The visualization includes an interactive tooltip providing details like start and end positions, peak values, and sample names. Titling and legends are absent, but the plot utilizes opacity for visual clarity, with a consistent center radius in its layout.
