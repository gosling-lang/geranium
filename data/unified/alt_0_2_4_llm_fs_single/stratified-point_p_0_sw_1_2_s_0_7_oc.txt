The visualization is a linear layout scatter plot displaying genomic data across chromosome 1 between 1 and 3,000,500 base pairs. It represents expression values using points whose y-position and size are determined by the 'peak' field, with the genome positioned along the x-axis. The chart is organized by rows corresponding to four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is visually differentiated by unique colors, enhancing categorical clarity. Points have a transparency level set at 50%, facilitating visual overlap. The tooltip provides detailed information, including genomic start and end positions, peak value, and sample name. The view is interactive, allowing for detailed exploration within the specified genomic range.
