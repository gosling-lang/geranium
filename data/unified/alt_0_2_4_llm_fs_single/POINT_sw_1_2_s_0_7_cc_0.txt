The visualization presents a scatter plot in a linear layout, illustrating a multivec file over the entire genome of hg38. The x-axis encodes genomic positions labeled by chromosome, while the y-axis represents quantitative 'peak' values. The points' size and placement on the y-axis are determined by the 'peak' data field, and all points are pink. The chart carries the title "Basic Marks: point" and the subtitle "Tutorial Examples."
