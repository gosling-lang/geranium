A linear and circular visualization displays genomic data from hg19 assembly, focusing on chromosome 1. The circular view features an ideogram, text annotation for "Putative Driver," range annotations for "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and a within-link track illustrating structural variations labeled by types such as "Translocation" and "Duplication" in different colors. A blue brush highlights chromosome intervals, linking the circular and linear views, which show more detailed tracks: a linear ideogram, gene data, point mutations shown as scatter plots, indel visualizations, and copy number variants represented as bars. The views emphasize structural variations and genetic features using color and shape stratification.
