The visualization is a scatter plot in a linear layout, illustrating point mutations derived from a VCF file. It uses a vertical arrangement and displays genomic positions on the x-axis, while the y-axis represents the log-transformed distance to the previous mutation. Each point is colored by the subtype of mutation, with categories including 'C>A', 'C>G', 'C>T', 'T>A', 'T>C', and 'T>G'. The data is filtered to exclude null values in the 'DISTPREVLOGE' field. The visualization has a subtitle, "Point mutations from a VCF file."
