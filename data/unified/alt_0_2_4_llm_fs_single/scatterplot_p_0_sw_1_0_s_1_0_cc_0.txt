A scatter plot in a linear layout visualizes genomic data across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 using a multivec file. Points represent expression values, with their position and size encoded by the 'peak' field. The points are colored according to the 'sample' field, featuring categories such as 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', with colors including blue, orange, green, and red. The visualization is interactive, providing genomic positions and values on hover with a tooltip. The plot includes a legend to denote categories and is configured with a transparency of 0.5, facilitating comparison of expression values among different samples. The chart occupies a space of 600x160 pixels and is aligned horizontally.
