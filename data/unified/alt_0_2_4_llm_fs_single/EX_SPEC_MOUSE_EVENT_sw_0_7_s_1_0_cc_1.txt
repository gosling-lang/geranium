A set of linear and genomic range annotation tracks showing multivec data are presented in five charts. The charts, titled "Custom Mouse Events," display interactive features like mouse hovering and range selection. The first three bar charts, titled "Individual Marks," "Group Marks By Sample," and "Group Marks By Genomic Position," represent genomic intervals along the x-axis and quantitative "peak" values along the y-axis. Each bar's color corresponds to different samples within the multivec dataset. The "Group Marks By Gene" track visualizes gene annotations with elements such as triangles, rectangles, and text labels mapped along chromosome 3. The final track, "Group Marks By Chromosome," includes an ideogram with bands, rectangles, and triangles, illustrating chromosomal features. The charts implement various interactive mouse events, including custom hover colors, stroke styles, and selection hues.
