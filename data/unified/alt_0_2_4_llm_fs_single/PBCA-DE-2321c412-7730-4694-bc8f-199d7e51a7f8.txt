The visualization comprises a circular and a linear view connected by a blue interactive brush in the circular view, representing the genome using the hg19 assembly. The circular view features several tracks: a circular ideogram, a point annotation track titled "Putative Driver," and two range annotation tracks named "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)." These tracks display genomic intervals with color-coded rectangles: blue for "Gain" and orange for "LOH." A line-connection track highlights various structural variations based on "svclass," such as 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' 'Inversion (TtT),' and 'Inversion (HtH).' 

The linear view, aligned below, provides a detailed view of chromosome 1. It contains an ideogram, a gene annotation track showing gene orientations, a scatterplot titled "Point Mutation" visualizing point mutations colored by subtype, and additional range annotation tracks similar to the circular view. The "Copy Number Variants" track uses gray rectangles to visualize quantitative differences. Horizontal lines and triangles are used in various tracks to depict different genomic elements and connections. The entire layout of both views is designed to provide an interactive exploration of genomic data, allowing for detailed analysis of structural variations and mutations.
