The visualization features a circular and linear view, linked by a blue interactive brush on the circular side. The circular layout visualizes the entire hg19 genome, with tracks such as an ideogram, text annotations, blue rectangles for 'Gain', and red rectangles for 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)'. It also displays connection lines colored by structural variant types like 'Gain', 'LOH', and others. The linear component focuses on chromosome 1, including similar tracks alongside a gene annotation section and a scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation' displaying VCF data. The scatterplot represents mutation distances with color-coded points based on subtype. Additional tracks include variety-specific annotations, showcasing genetic data with rectangles and connection lines for features like 'Insertion', 'Deletion', and 'Copy Number Variants'.
