A circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file focusing on chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart consists of multiple layers, each representing a category such as 'sample 1', 'sample 2', and others, excluding 'sample -'. Bars encode quantitative values labeled as 'peak' and are distinguished by different colors for each category. This genomic data is displayed on a circular axis, and each track is stratified by rows, enhancing comparative visual analysis. The layout is interactive, enabling dynamic exploration within specified genomic intervals.
