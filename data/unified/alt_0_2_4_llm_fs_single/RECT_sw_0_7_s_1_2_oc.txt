A linear ideogram visualizes chromosome 1 of the hg38 assembly, showing genomic intervals with colored rectangles. Rectangles are colored based on the 'Stain' field, indicating categories such as 'gneg,' 'gpos25,' 'gpos50,' 'gpos75,' 'gpos100,' and 'gvar.' Colors range from white to shades of gray and blue. The title is 'Basic Marks: Rect,' and the subtitle is 'Tutorial Examples.'
