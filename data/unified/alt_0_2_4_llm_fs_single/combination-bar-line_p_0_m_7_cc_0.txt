A genomic visualization in a linear layout shows multivec data from chromosome 1, spanning from position 1 to 3,000,500. The visualization consists of two tracks arranged vertically. The top track is a scatter plot, where the x-axis represents genomic positions, and the y-axis represents expression values, displayed as points. Each point's color corresponds to one of four samples, indicated in the legend. The bottom track combines an area chart and a line chart. It features rows for each sample with distinct colors, mirroring those in the scatter plot. This track shows expression values with areas and lines across the genomic range. The tooltip provides detailed information about genomic positions and corresponding values for individual points and samples.
