The visualization titled "Example: Semantic Zooming" is a linear ideogram illustrating chromosomal bands from the hg38 assembly. As users zoom in, text labels and triangle marks are revealed to provide additional details. The chart uses rectangles to denote chromosomal regions, colored in varying shades of gray based on the chromosome. Text labels display the chromosome names, while left and right triangles in maroon appear at specific areas, indicating centromeres. This setup enables a detailed exploration of chromosomal structures through interactive zooming.
