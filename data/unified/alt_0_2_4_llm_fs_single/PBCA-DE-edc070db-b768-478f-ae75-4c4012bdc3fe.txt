A genomic visualization with both circular and linear views displaying multiple types of genomic data on the hg19 assembly. The circular view includes an ideogram showing chromosome bands, a text track labeled 'Putative Driver' with biallelic annotations, and range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' visualizing copy number variations in blue and orange rectangles. Lines connecting genomic positions represent structural variants such as 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion,' with colors indicating different types.

The linear view, linked by an interactive brush in the circular view, details chromosome 1. It features an ideogram, a text track for putative driver mutations, and a gene annotation track with exon structures. A scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' shows VCF data with points colored by mutation subtype. Additionally, there are tracks for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' from VCF data with rectangles differentiated by shades, and a 'Copy Number Variants' track displaying numeric copy variations in grey.
