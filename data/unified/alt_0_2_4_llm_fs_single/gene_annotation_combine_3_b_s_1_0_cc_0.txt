A linear layout visualization compares gene annotations across three different tracks for the region on chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The first track, "HiGlass," displays gene annotations with plus-strand genes in blue and minus-strand genes in orange, using triangles and rectangles to indicate gene direction and exons, respectively. The second track, "IGV," shows a similar annotation in pink, with text labels on top of the genomic positions. The third track, "Corces et al.," uses smaller text and rectangles with blue for plus-strand and orange for minus-strand, offering a detailed gene and exon depiction. Each track is aligned vertically, allowing for easy comparison of gene structures and positions.
