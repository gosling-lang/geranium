A vertically arranged linear visualization presents data from a multivec file across chromosome 1 positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top scatter plot depicts genomic positions on the x-axis, with quantitative peaks on the y-axis, size-encoded by peak values. Points are colored by categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4,' with an opacity of 0.5, and include grid lines. A legend indicates the categories. The bottom scatter plot, also color-encoded by sample categories, shows the same data stratified into rows for each sample. Tooltip information provides genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample categories. The visualization uses assembly hg38.
