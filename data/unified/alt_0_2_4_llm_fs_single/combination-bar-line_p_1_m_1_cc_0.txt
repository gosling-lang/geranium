The genome browser visualization includes two vertically arranged linear tracks, representing a multivec file, visualizing genomic data for chromosome 1 (interval: 1 to 3,000,500). The top track is a combination of a scatter plot and bar chart, where genomic positions are shown on the x-axis, while expression peaks are displayed on the y-axis. It features four rows for samples labeled 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'. Points and bars are colored distinctly: blue, orange, green, and red respectively, with sizes representing peak values.

The bottom track is an area chart using similar color encoding, displaying genomic positions on the x-axis and expression peaks on the y-axis, with color areas indicating different samples. Both tracks have tooltips providing information on genomic position, peak values, and sample names. The visualization allows for distinct categorical visualization through colors and is structured in a way to provide easy comparative insights between different samples over specified chromosomal intervals.
