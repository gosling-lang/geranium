A multi-track linear visualization displays genomic data. The "Gap" track uses a gray bar chart to show regions with gaps in nucleotide sequences, with values along the right y-axis. The "Conservation" track presents conservation scores using a colored bar chart, where the bars' heights indicate conservation levels. The main track has rows for different genomic sequences represented by colored rectangles, each color indicating a different nucleotide or amino acid, with their positions aligned on the x-axis. The bottom overlay combines a bar chart and rectangles, indicating sequence alignments. The layout is horizontal with interactive zoom capabilities, covering a genomic interval from position 350 to 396. The design includes detailed color coding and alignment features for comprehensive genomic analysis.
