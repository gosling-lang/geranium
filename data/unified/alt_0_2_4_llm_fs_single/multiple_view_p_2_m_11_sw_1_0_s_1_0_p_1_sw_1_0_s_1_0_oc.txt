This visualization, titled "Visual Linking," displays genomic data using a combination of scatter plots, area charts, and line charts. It features a dynamic vertical arrangement with multiple tracks linked by interactive brushes for detailed updates.

1. **Top Track:** A scatter plot in a linear layout focused on chromosome 1 between positions 160,000,000 and 200,000,000. It shows expression levels on the y-axis with colored points, stratified by samples "sample 1" through "sample 4."

2. **Bottom Left Track:** An area chart in a horizontal layout covering chromosome 1, displaying a summary view with an interactive brush. Expression is shown with filled areas, each color-coded by sample categories.

3. **Bottom Right Track:** A circular line chart, also showing chromosome 1, illustrating expression trends with lines. The brush in this track links back to the detail view, allowing for refined genomic navigation.

Each track is stratified by samples, displaying distinct colors for different data categories, enhancing clarity in analyzing the genomic intervals.
