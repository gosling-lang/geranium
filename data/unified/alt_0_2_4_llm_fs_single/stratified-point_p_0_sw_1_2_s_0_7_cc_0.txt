A linear layout visualizes a multivec file across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The chart uses a scatter plot to represent genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. Four samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4') are represented as rows, with point size and color indicating expression magnitude and sample category, respectively. Each sample is assigned a distinct color: blue, orange, green, and red. The transparency of data points is set at 50%, enhancing data visualization. The chart includes a dynamic tooltip feature providing detailed genomic and quantitative data at specific points.
