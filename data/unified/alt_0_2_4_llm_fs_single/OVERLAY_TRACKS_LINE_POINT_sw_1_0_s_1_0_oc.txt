The visualization is a multiline and scatter plot with overlaid tracks in a linear layout, titled "Example: Overlayed Tracks." It presents data from multiple samples mapped to chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis shows quantitative expression values. Each line and scatter plot point corresponds to a unique sample, differentiated by distinct colorsâ€”orange, green, blue, and purple. The scatter plot points vary in size based on the 'peak' values, with a size range from 0 to 6. The chart is stratified by rows, with each row representing a different sample category. The data is sourced from a multivec file.
