A genomic sequence visualization featuring two main views. The first view displays aligned sequences and genomic annotations over two tracks: a "Gap" track shown as a gray bar chart, and a "Conservation" track represented as a bar chart with quantitative color coding. A series of colored rectangles represents sequence data overlayed with text labels indicating specific bases. The layout is linear and horizontal. The second view features an overlay chart showing conservation and gap data across the entire sequence range from positions 0 to 396, with zoom interactivity linking the two views. The design is outlined in light gray, ensuring clarity and focus on genomic data.
