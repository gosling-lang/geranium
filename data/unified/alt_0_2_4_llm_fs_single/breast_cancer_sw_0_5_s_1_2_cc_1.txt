The visualization is a linear arrangement displaying five distinct tracks, focusing on the genomic data of chromosome 1. The top track is an ideogram, illustrating the cytobands with different colors, and includes right and left triangles indicating centromeres. The second track features a genomic position annotation track with triangular markers; blue triangles represent positive strand gene positions, while orange triangles indicate negative strand gene positions. The third and fourth tracks display genomic regions in green rectangles; these represent filtered minor copy number variation (CNV) and total CNV in tumor data, respectively. The bottom track is a link track connecting genomic positions with lines in varied colors, denoting different structural variations such as tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions. The layout leverages color and shape to convey complex genomic relationships effectively.
