The visualization showcases genomic position annotations using triangles. Titled "Basic Marks: Triangles" with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples," it features a linear layout. The x-axis represents chromosomal positions, spanning several chromosomes such as chr1, chr2, etc. Triangles indicate genomic features: blue right-pointing triangles for the '+' strand and red left-pointing triangles for the '-' strand. The chart is divided by rows based on strand orientation, emphasizing categories through color differentiation.
