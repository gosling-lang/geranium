A circular bar chart visualizes a vector dataset in a circular layout. The visualization represents the entire genome of hg38, with the chromosomal position shown around the circle. The height of the bars, which are colored in a pale yellow, encodes quantitative values from the data field named 'peak.' The chart has a center radius of 0.3 and is aligned in a stacked format, emphasizing comparative differences in genomic expression across chromosomes.
