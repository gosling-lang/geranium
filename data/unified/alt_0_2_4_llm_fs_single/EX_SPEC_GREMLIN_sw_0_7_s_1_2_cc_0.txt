The visualization features a linear layout titled "Gremlin (O'Brien et al. 2010)" focusing on human chromosome 5. The top track displays an ideogram with color-coded bands representing different staining categories, such as gneg, gpos25, and acen, displayed in shades from light gray to black and pink for acen regions. The x-axis is marked for genomic positions, annotated with text labels for band names. Beneath, a segmented duplication track shows genomic regions as rectangles with connections between duplicate segments within and across chromosomes hs5, hs4, and hs6. These segments are colored differently and arranged in rows by chromosome, with added transparency. The "Region of Interest" track narrows down interactions to positions between 68,000,000 and 71,000,000 on chr5, also demonstrating links between segments from the same set of chromosomes. Following this, the "Rearrangement View" provides a detailed close-up of rearrangements within a smaller window of chr5, particularly between 69,276,000 and 69,282,000, showing prominent purple connections. Overall, the visualization uses varied colors and opacities to represent genomic structures and interactions, employing brushes to facilitate linking between the charts.
