The visualization is a linear plot titled "Pileup Track Using BAM Data," displaying genomic data from chromosome 1 covering the range between 136,750 and 139,450. It contains two tracks. The top track is a bar chart showing coverage of reads, where the height of the bars corresponds to the number of reads, using a silver color. The bottom track visualizes individual reads as rectangles, with rows stratified by structural variation types. The rectangles are colored based on categories such as 'normal read', 'deletion (+-)', and others, with colors ranging from yellow to red to gray, among others. The width of the visualization is 1050 pixels, and it is interactive with tooltips providing detailed genomic information.
