The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view arranged vertically, showing genomic data from the hg19 assembly. The circular view contains five tracks: an ideogram, a text annotation track titled 'Putative Driver,' and three range annotation tracks. The tracks represent genomic regions such as 'Gain' in blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange. Connections between genomic positions are depicted with various colors representing structural variations: Gain, LOH, Translocation, Duplication, Deletion, and Inversions. The linear view zooms into chromosome 1, featuring additional tracks: a gene annotation track, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' using a VCF file with color-coded points for mutation types, and a CSV-based track displaying 'Copy Number Variants' in grey. This design utilizes a brush tool in the circular view to link to the corresponding linear region.
