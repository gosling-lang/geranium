The visualization consists of two vertically stacked linear genomic tracks focusing on chromosome 2. The top track is a line chart displaying data from "sample 1," "sample 3," and "sample 4," with colors blue, orange, and green, respectively. Each line represents quantitative values of "peak" across genomic positions on the x-axis, stratified by sample on the y-axis. The bottom track is an area chart showing "sample 1" and "sample 2" using the same blue and orange color scheme, with the area representing the peak values. Both charts are encoded to emphasize categorical distinctions by color. The axis delineates genomic positions on chr2, and both tracks include white strokes with a width of 0.5 for clearer visualization.
