The visualization is composed of multiple tracks using a linear layout to demonstrate the repositioning of genomic marks on selected chromosomes to address visual overlaps. The first panel focuses on chromosome 3, displaying transcripts from the hg38 genome assembly. Marks are displaced into rows to prevent overlap, with blue and orange arrows indicating strand orientation. The second panel presents data from chromosome 2 with annotations for "Likely Benign" variants. Points and text indicating nucleotide changes are included, using color to differentiate categories. Another panel showcases connections between genomic regions using light green lines, while additional tracks present gene annotations with colored triangles and rectangles representing exons and introns. The final view highlights chromosome 17, with a focus on variant pathogenicity represented by colored points, illustrating significant genomic positions in a vertically arranged format.
