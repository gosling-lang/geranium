The visualization consists of two vertically arranged linear charts displaying multivec data for chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The top chart is a scatter plot stratified by sample rows (sample 1 to sample 4), each displayed with points colored in blue, orange, green, and red respectively. Point size is proportional to the 'peak' value. The bottom chart is an area plot, also colored by sample, showing the genomic 'peak' values as a continuous area, with each sample differentiated by color. Both charts feature a genomic x-axis and a quantitative y-axis, with tooltips providing additional data on hover.
