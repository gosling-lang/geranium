The visualization is a linear area chart displaying genomic data across multiple chromosomes. Represented in a purple color, the area chart uses a multivec file to show the expression values derived from the field 'peak'. These values are aligned on the x-axis representing genomic positions, while the y-axis quantifies the expression magnitude. The title of the chart is "Basic Marks: area" with a subtitle "Tutorial Examples". The chart, centered in a linear layout, spans the entire assembly hg38, demonstrating a comprehensive overview of genome-wide data.
