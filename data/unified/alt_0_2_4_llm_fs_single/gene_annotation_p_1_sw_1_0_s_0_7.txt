The visualization consists of two vertical arrangements of genomic range annotation tracks. The horizontal layout covers a region on chromosome 3 from positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. 

**First Arrangement:**
- **Corces et al.**: Displays genes and exons with text annotations for gene names. Positive strand genes are marked in blue and negative strand genes in red. Exons are shown as rectangles; gene connections as lines.
- **IGV**: Similar to Corces et al., but with genes represented in navy color and exons connected by white lines with triangle patterns indicating strand direction.
- **HiGlass**: Visualizes genes with blue and red triangles indicating strands, text for gene names, and exons in rectangles. Lines connect gene starts and ends with a similar triangle pattern as IGV.

**Second Arrangement:**
- **GmGDV**: Displays genes with text annotations, exons as blue and red triangles, and lines connecting them. Different strand directions are shown in blue and red.
- **Cyverse-QUBES**: Shows annotations with black text for gene names, gray triangles for directional strands, gray rectangles for genes, and purple rectangles for exons, connected by gray lines.

Each chart is stratified by strand with colors and patterns denoting strands, while maintaining genomic alignment across tracks.
