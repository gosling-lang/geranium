A circular and linear genomic visualization displays detailed structural variations across the hg19 assembly. The circular view, representing the entire genome, connects to a linear view focused on chromosome 1 through a blue interactive brush. The circular view features five tracks: an ideogram, a 'Putative Driver' text track, and three range annotation tracks showing 'Gain' in blue and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange. Connections between genomic positions are shown as lines colored by data field categories ('Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', 'Inversion'). The linear view adds more layers: a gene annotation track, a 'Point Mutation' scatter plot visualizing VCF data, two range annotation tracks for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion', and a 'Copy Number Variants' track using gray rectangles.
