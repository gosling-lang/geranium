The visualization consists of three horizontal bar charts aligned side by side, each displaying genomic intervals on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis. The first chart represents data from chromosome 12 within the interval 5,000,000 to 15,000,000, using navy blue bars. The second chart visualizes data from chromosome 9, also within the same interval, with orange bars. The third chart, similar to the first, represents chromosome 12 but uses yellow bars. Each chart includes a white stroke around the bars for clarity. The data is sourced from a multivec file focusing on "sample 1," with visualization adjustments for widths under 1200 pixels.
