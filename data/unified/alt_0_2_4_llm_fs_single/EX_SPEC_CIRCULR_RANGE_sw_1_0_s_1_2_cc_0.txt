A circular bar chart visualizes a vector file, displaying the entire genome in a circular layout. The x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative peak values. The bars are colored pink, and the layout has a center radius of 0.3 with a static alignment. The data source is a vector file from a specified URL. The chart is designed to show genomic expression with a uniform circular arrangement, ensuring that each bar radiates outwardly to depict the magnitude of gene expression levels across the genome.
