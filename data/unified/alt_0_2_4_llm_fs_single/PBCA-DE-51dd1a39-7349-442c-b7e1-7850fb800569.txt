A circular and linear layout presents genomic data using the hg19 assembly. The visual contains a comprehensive ideogram highlighting cytobands in various colors to differentiate categories. The circular layout includes multiple annotation tracks such as "Putative Driver," displaying genes as text annotations, and structural variations represented through line connections of different colors. Two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" mark genomic intervals with blue and orange rectangles, respectively. An overlay track visualizes translocation, duplication, and deletion events.

The linear view, linked to the circular view by a brush, focuses on chromosome 1. It features an ideogram, gene annotations with directional triangles, and a scatter plot for point mutations categorized by subtypes. Insets for insertions and deletions display data using distinct shapes. The "Copy Number Variants" track visualizes quantitative data using gray bars, while tracks for "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity" display data using colored rectangles. Each view is dynamically interactive, highlighting the genomic architecture and structural variations comprehensively.
