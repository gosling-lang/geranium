A circular visualization showing genomic data with two tracks. The outer track is a circular bar chart representing multivec data for chromosome 1, displaying samples in different colors: blue, orange, green, and red. Each bar's height encodes the 'peak' quantitative value. The inner track is a circular ideogram of chromosome 1, highlighting genomic regions in different shades of gray and blue, corresponding to various stains. The layout has a center radius of 0.6 and a spacing of 5. The visualization uses data from hg38 assembled datasets, dynamically supporting zoom interactions.
