A circular scatter plot visualizes genomic data from a multivec file, focusing on chromosome 1 between 1 and 3,000,500. The chart is arranged vertically and stratified into four rows, each representing a different sample: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The expression values are shown with points whose size correlates with the 'peak' value. Each sample is represented by a distinct color: blue, orange, green, and red respectively. The visualization is static and features an interactive tooltip providing genomic positions and values for each data point.
