The visualization presents a vertical arrangement of four linear tracks showcasing BED files. The genomic region spans chromosome 1 from 1 to 2,000,000. The first track, titled "BED12," uses BED files with all standard fields, represented as green rectangles. The second track, "BED6," displays the first six BED fields in pink. The third track, "BED6+6," includes additional custom fields, shown in sky blue. The final track, "BED12+1," extends the standard fields with one additional custom field, also in sky blue. Each track uses rectangular marks to depict genomic intervals, with a uniform stroke and size for consistency. The overall layout effectively demonstrates different BED file specifications in chromosome 1.
