A linear visualization composed of two vertically arranged tracks displays multivec data for chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track features a stacked bar chart with genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression data on the y-axis. Each bar is colored to represent one of four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The variations in expression are shown along the y and ye-axes, where 'peak_min' and 'peak_max' values define the range.

The bottom track displays an area chart with a similar color scheme for the same samples. It maps expression against genomic positions along the x-axis, using 'peak' values along the y-axis. Each chart segment is colored according to the sample, aiding in differentiation. Both tracks provide tooltips with detailed information about genomic positions and expression values, enhancing interactivity. The assembly used is hg38, with a total width of 720 pixels and height of 186 pixels for each track.
