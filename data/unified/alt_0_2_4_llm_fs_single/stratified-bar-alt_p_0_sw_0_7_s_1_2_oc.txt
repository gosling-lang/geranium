A multi-row bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, depicting chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The chart includes four stratified rows, each representing different samples labeled 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each sample is shown in a unique color and is plotted with bars that encode the range of peak values between 'peak_min' and 'peak_max' on the y-axis. This visualization is further enhanced with tooltips providing insights into genomic positions and peak values. The x-axis is divided into genomic intervals, highlighting specific segments of chromosome 1.
