A linear layout visualization displays segmental duplications across chromosome 1, specifically between the 103,900,000 and 104,100,000 intervals. The visualization consists of rectilinear tracks and connection tracks indicating duplicated segments. Green is used both for the rectangles representing specific genomic intervals and for the connections between these intervals, visualizing relational data. The representation utilizes a CSV file describing start and end positions of duplications, with a consistent stroke and opacity applied to both rectangles and connections.
