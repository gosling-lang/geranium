A genomic visualization with a circular and linear view, displaying a comprehensive overview of chromosome 1. The circular arrangement features an ideogram for chromosome annotation, a textual track titled "Putative Driver" indicating genetic elements, and two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" showing genomic features in blue and orange, respectively. Additionally, multiple connecting tracks highlight structural variations with lines in various colors, representing different subtypes such as "Translocation," "Duplication," and "Deletion," based on the data field 'svclass.' The linear view provides more detail for the same chromosome, including a gene annotation track, a "Point Mutation" scatter plot revealing mutations with colored points, and further range annotation tracks illustrating "Insertions" and "Deletions" in white and gray. Together, the views offer a detailed and interactive genomic data exploration experience, seamlessly linked by a blue brush in the ideogram.
