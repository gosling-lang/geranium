The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view, linked by an interactive blue brush. The circular view, titled "Ideogram," displays the entire hg19 genome with several tracks: an ideogram, a text track titled "Putative Driver," range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," and a connection track showing structural variations. Connections are color-coded to represent different structural variations: "Gain," "LOH," "Translocation," "Duplication," "Deletion," and "Inversion."

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and includes analogous tracks: an ideogram, a text track titled "Putative Driver," gene annotations, and additional data. The scatterplot titled "Point Mutation" visualizes variants from a VCF file, with points color-coded by mutation subtypes. Range annotations are used to represent "Insertion" and "Deletion," while "Copy Number Variants" are shown with a quantitative axis. The visualization effectively combines genomic data types, highlighting chromosomal variations and mutations across both views.
