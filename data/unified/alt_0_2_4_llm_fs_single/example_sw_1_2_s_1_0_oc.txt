A composite visualization of genomic data using multiple encoding methods. The visualization is titled "Visual Encoding" with the subtitle "Gosling provides diverse visual encoding methods." It displays chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 and includes:

1. A heat map showing the genomic regions across samples 1 to 4, where expression values are encoded by color intensity.
2. Bar charts illustrating genomic data across samples, with values indicated by height and stratified by samples with distinct colors.
3. A combination of a line chart and scatter plot, illustrating expression values with lines and points sized by peak values, stratified by sample.
4. Scatter plots depicting genomic positions, where the point size and color represent expression values across samples.
5. An area chart where the expression data is shown through filled regions, colored by sample.
6. Charts showing min-max ranges of expression data, where bars represent these ranges for different samples.
7. A connection chart visualizing genomic data links, colored based on categorical values. 

The visualization effectively utilizes various marks such as rects, bars, points, lines, and connections to reveal complex genomic data relationships.
