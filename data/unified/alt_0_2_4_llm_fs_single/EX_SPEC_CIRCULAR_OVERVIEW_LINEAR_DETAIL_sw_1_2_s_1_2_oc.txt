A multiview visualization featuring circular and linear layouts displays genomic data from hg38. In the circular view, bar charts represent genomic intervals with expression values stratified by sample categories, distinguished by color. Connections between genomic positions highlight relationships and variations across selected chromosomes. The linear views provide detailed expression data on chromosomes 5 and 16, with brush-linked bar charts for interactive exploration. The color scheme is cohesive across views for sample identification, and multiple visual encodings enhance data interpretation.
