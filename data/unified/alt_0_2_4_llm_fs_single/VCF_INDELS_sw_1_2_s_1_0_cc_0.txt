The visualization is a linear chart illustrating insertions and deletions extracted from a VCF file. It is organized into two rows, with 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' as categories. The chart uses a genomic x-axis, displaying chromosome regions such as chr2, chr5, chr8, chr11, chr14, and chr18, among others. Insertions are represented in orange, while deletions are shown in green rectangles. Each rectangle's position corresponds to genomic coordinates, and the chart includes labeled text for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion'. The background color is a light grey (#F6F6F6), providing subtle contrast to the chart elements. The opacity setting is high, ensuring clear visibility of all data points.
