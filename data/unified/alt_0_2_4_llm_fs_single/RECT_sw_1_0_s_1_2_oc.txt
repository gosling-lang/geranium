The visualization is a linear ideogram displaying chromosome 1 from the hg38 assembly. Titled "Basic Marks: Rect" with a subtitle "Tutorial Examples," it uses colored rectangles to represent different chromosomal stain categories such as "gneg," "gpos25," "gpos50," "gpos75," "gpos100," and "gvar." The colors range from white for "gneg" to black for "gpos100" and purple for "gvar." The x-axis shows genomic start and end positions, with the width of each rectangle corresponding to the size of genomic intervals. The chart is styled with gray strokes and is non-static, allowing for potential interactions like zooming or panning.
