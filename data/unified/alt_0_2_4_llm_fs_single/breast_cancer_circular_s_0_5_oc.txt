A circular ideogram visualization displays genomic data of hg38 across chromosomes, utilizing a multi-track layout. An ideogram track shows chromosome bands with color-coded staining patterns such as gneg in white and gpos in shades of gray and black. Adjacent to it, two range annotation tracks depict copy number variations (CNV) from a CSV file. The first track highlights zero minor copy number tumor regions in orange, while the second shows amplified tumor regions in green. Inside, a link track visualizes structural rearrangements, with connections colored based on rearrangement types like tandem-duplication in green and translocation in blue.
