A circular layout visualization displays genomic data using various tracks. The outermost track is a circular bar chart depicting genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, rendered in sky blue bars. The subsequent track consists of a circular ideogram that categorizes genomic intervals with different colors. Another circular ideogram is included, sharing the title "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements," and categorizes data using rectangles of different colors. Additionally, a circular chart with connections is present, showcasing links between genomic positions. These connections are visually differentiated with green color, indicating various categorical data. The dataset features are visualized across a parallel arrangement, maintaining a fixed center radius and static layout. The focus on multivec and cyclic representations aids in exploring genomic patterns efficiently.
