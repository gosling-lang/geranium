The visualization consists of two main views: a circular view and a linear view, arranged vertically and linked by an interactive blue brush in the circular view. The circular view displays the entire genome with five tracks: an ideogram, a point annotation track (titled "Putative Driver" and visualizing CSV data), two range annotation tracks ("Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)"), and a line-connection track showing structural variations with different colors based on the "svclass" data field. Categories like "Gain," "LOH," and "Translocation" are highlighted.

The linear view zooms into chromosome 1 and offers more detailed visualization, featuring nine tracks. It includes an ideogram with chromosomal positions, a point annotation track showing "Putative Driver" markers, a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" visualizing VCF data with points colored by mutation subtypes, and two additional range annotation tracks ("Insertion" and "Deletion") showing rectangles in yellow and green. Another track, "Copy Number Variants," visualizes bar heights representing quantitative data, with gray rectangles. The views are interactive, offering tooltip details and color-code legend for easy interpretation. The genome data is based on the hg19 assembly.
