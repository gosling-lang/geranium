A complex visualization of breast cancer genetic data features both circular and linear arrangements. The title is "Breast Cancer Variant (Staaf et al. 2019)," with a subtitle about RAD51C- and PALB2-altered TNBCs. The first section is a circular layout showing various genomic data across the entire genome. The tracks include "Patient Overview," displaying an ideogram with categories colored according to chromosomal stains. A "Putative Driver" track uses text and black triangles, while "LOH" and "Gain" tracks show genomic changes in dark orange and green rectangles, respectively. The "Structural Variant" track provides connections between genomic positions, using colors to denote classes like tandem-duplication and translocation.

Below, a linear layout details chromosome 1. An ideogram serves as a background, with triangle marks and text indicating genomic annotation. Additional tracks display detailed "Putative Driver" information, gene annotations, LOH, and Gain characteristics in Genomic range annotation tracks. The "Structural Variant" track repeats here as well.

Adjacent linear views provide more specific genomic coverage and pileup data obtained from BAM files. These include coverage bar charts and pileup display with color-coded categorical variations such as deletions and inversions, spanning defined intervals on chromosome 1. The layout's sophisticated layering and linking offer an in-depth view of genomic alterations associated with breast cancer, displayed using a Gosling specification.
