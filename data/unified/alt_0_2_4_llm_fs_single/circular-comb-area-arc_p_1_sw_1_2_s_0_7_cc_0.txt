The visualization is a circular layout containing two horizontally arranged views. The left view features a circular chart with connections, representing genomic intervals on chromosome 1 between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. The connections are color-coded to indicate different categories. The right view is a circular area chart displaying genomic positions and expression values. Four samples are represented, each with a distinct color. The area chart is stratified by rows, with category colors displayed in a legend. The layout and connections illustrate genomic relationships and patterns over specified intervals.
