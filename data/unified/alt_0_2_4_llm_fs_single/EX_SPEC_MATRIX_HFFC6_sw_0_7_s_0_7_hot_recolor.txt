A visualization titled "Matrix Visualization" compares the Micro-C and Hi-C data for HFFc6 cells on chromosome 7, between genomic positions 77,700,000 and 81,000,000. The display is arranged horizontally with adjacent vertical views.

**Left Vertical View:**
- *Tracks:*
  - **HFFc6_H3K4me3:** Purple bar chart displaying genomic intervals on chr7, representing peaks from a bigWig dataset.
  - **HFFc6_ATAC:** Dark green bar chart with similar genomic coverage.
  - Multiple overlays show CTCF alignment and gene annotations using colored bars and triangles.
  - **HFFc6_Micro-C Matrix:** An orange-colored matrix chart encoding interactions based on genomic positions.

**Right Vertical View:**
- *Tracks:*
  - Similar bar charts as the left view for **HFFc6_H3K4me3** and **HFFc6_ATAC**.
  - Gene annotations are displayed with colored triangles stratified by strand types.
  - **HFFc6_Hi-C Matrix:** Mirrors the left matrix with similar color intensity encoding.
  
**Bottom Track in Both Views:**
- **Epilogos (hg38):** Color-coded bar chart displaying 15 genomic categories, from "Active TSS" to "Quiescent/Low," across shared genomic intervals.

This visualization uses a consistent visual encoding scheme across both views to compare
