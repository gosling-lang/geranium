The circular area chart visualizes a multivec file representing chromosome 12, covering the interval from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The layout is circular, displaying the genomic data in stratified rows for multiple samples. Each sample is represented by a unique color. The chart's x-axis shows genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative expression peaks. Colors from a predefined palette indicate different samples, facilitating comparative analysis across 13 samples after filtering out undesired data. The visualization's design incorporates multiple opacity settings and domain ranges to highlight variations in data. The reference for this visualization is "Graphical perception of Multiple Time Series" by Javed et al., TVCG 2010.
