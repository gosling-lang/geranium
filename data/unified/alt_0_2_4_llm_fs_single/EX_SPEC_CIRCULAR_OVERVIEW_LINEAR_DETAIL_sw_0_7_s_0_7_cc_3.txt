A vertical arrangement consisting of a circular overview and detailed linear views. The circular visualization features a stacked bar chart with genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, stratified by row categories with distinct colors. It includes overlay brushes to link genomic details with linear views. A chart within the circle shows genomic connections using curved lines with color-coded strokes for categories, predominantly green. Below, two detailed horizontal bar charts present genomic intervals on chromosomes 5 and 16, colored similarly according to samples. The linear views are linked back to the circular overview by the interactive brushes, enhancing drill-downs across genomic regions.
