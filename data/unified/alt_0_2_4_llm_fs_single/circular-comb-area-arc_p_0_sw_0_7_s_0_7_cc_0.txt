The circular visualization in a vertical arrangement consists of two main tracks. The left track features an area chart displaying genomic data across chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The data is stratified by four categories—'sample 1' through 'sample 4'—each represented by distinct area colors. The chart utilizes a multivec file to encode peak values along the y-axis and genomic positions along the x-axis. The right track is a connection chart illustrating within-link connections among genomic intervals on chromosome 1. The connections are colored based on nominal values from the dataset, adding a layer of categorical distinction.
