The visualization features a circular and a linear view stacked vertically, linked by a blue interactive brush in the circular view. The circular layout depicts the entire genome, focusing on structural variations such as 'Gain,' 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' and various structural variants like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication' across chromosomes. The linear view corresponds to chromosome 1, showing detailed tracks including a gene annotation track, a scatterplot for point mutations, and copy number variations. Each view displays data with distinct color schemes for categories, facilitating comparisons of genomic intervals and annotations.
