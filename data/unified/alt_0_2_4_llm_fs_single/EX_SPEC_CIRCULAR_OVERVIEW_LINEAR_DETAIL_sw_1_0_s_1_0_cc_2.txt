The visualization consists of a circular arrangement and two linear bar charts. The circular layout features two tracks: a multivec bar chart and a connection track, both showing genomic intervals. The bar chart displays expression levels stratified by rows of categories, with colors representing four samples in distinct shades. The connection track links genomic positions, with strokes indicating categories such as deletion and inversion. Below, two linear bar charts provide detailed views of chromosome 5 and chromosome 16, linked by brushes to sections of the circular view. Each bar chart showcases genomic intervals with expression levels colored according to sample categories. The interactive brushes in the circular chart allow focus on specific regions in the linear charts.
