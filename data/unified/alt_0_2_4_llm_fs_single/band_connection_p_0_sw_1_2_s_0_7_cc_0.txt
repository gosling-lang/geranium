The visualization represents gene duplication events on chromosome 1, focusing on the interval between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. The layout is linear and contains seven tracks. Each track alternates between rectangle marks and connection (between link) marks. 

Rectangles indicate specific genomic intervals colored in pink and sky blue, with pink representing one set of genomic regions and sky blue another. Connections between these rectangles are displayed in sky blue lines, indicating associations or duplications between different genomic segments.

The data is sourced from a CSV file and visual encoding includes opacity for visibility and stroke for emphasis. The alignment of tracks helps in visualizing duplication events, and tooltips offer detailed genomic positions for precise information. The display is finely structured, showing variations and connections across the specified genomic range.
