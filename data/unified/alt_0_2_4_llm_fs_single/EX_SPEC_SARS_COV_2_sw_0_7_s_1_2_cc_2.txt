The visualization presents genomic data of SARS-CoV-2 in a linear layout. It consists of multiple tracks displaying gene annotations, sequence information, and recombination events along chromosome NC_045512.2. The upper view titled "NC_045512.2 Genes" shows gene positions with green rectangles, purple lines, and texts. Below, the "S Protein Annotation" track stratifies data by protein domains using different colors. The "NC_045512.2 Sequence" track visualizes nucleotide counts of bases A, T, G, C as colored bars. Finally, the "TRS-L-Dependent Recombination Events" track displays connecting arcs for recombination with dim purple lines. The visualization is interactive with a highlighted brush, enabling detailed exploration of genomic intervals. The visualization integrates data from the WashU Virus Genome Browser, NCBI, and GISAID.
