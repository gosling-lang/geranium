A circular visualization displays genomic data for chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500 in a split vertical layout. On the left, a circular heat map encodes expression values with color intensity from a multivec file. The heat map is stratified by four sample categories, highlighting peak values with a 'hot' color scheme. On the right, a circular bar chart represents the same genomic intervals with bars indicating expression values on the y-axis. It is stratified by sample categories, shown through distinct bar colors including shades of blue, orange, green, and red. Each track includes tooltips providing detailed data values, such as start and end genomic positions, peak values, and sample identifiers. The layout and visual encoding emphasize differences and patterns across samples in a visually compact manner.
