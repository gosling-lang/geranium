The visualization displays a hybrid view consisting of a circular and a linear layout depicting genomic information. The circular section includes five tracks with an ideogram at the outermost representing the human genome, using different colors to distinguish various bands. Tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' use blue and orange respectively, displaying genomic ranges. A network-like 'withinLink' track shows connections with varying colors for categories such as 'Translocation', 'Duplication', and 'Inversion.'

The linear section focuses on chromosome 1, corresponding to the circular view's highlighted region. Tracks include a detailed ideogram, text for 'Putative Driver' genes, a scatter plot for point mutations visualized with colored dots, and range annotations for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion.' A track titled 'Copy Number Variants' shows quantitative data through grey rectangles. Connections in multiple colors visually represent structural variations in detail.
