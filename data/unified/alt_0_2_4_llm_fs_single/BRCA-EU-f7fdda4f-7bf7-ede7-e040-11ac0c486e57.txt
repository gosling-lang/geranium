A complex genomic visualization composed of 23 individual charts is shown in a linear and circular layout. The circular view presents the entire genome with multiple tracks, including an ideogram, text annotations, genomic ranges, and connection lines. Each track visualizes different aspects such as 'Gain' in blue rectangles and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in orange rectangles. Connection lines indicate genomic interactions, color-coded based on categories such as 'Translocation' and 'Duplication.'

The linear view shows detailed information for chromosome 1. It includes an ideogram, text annotations for 'Putative Driver' mutations, and a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' displaying various mutation types with distinct colors. Additional tracks show data on insertions, deletions, copy number variants, and gain and loss regions, supporting detailed genomic analysis. The visualization employs interactive features like a blue brush linking the circular and linear views, enhancing data exploration.
