A genomic visualization titled "Gremlin (O'Brien et al. 2010)" displays a linear layout of Chromosome 5 from the hg38 assembly. The main view includes an ideogram track with categorical staining patterns in shades of gray and pink. Text labels are applied to significant genomic bands. Below, two tracks showcase segmental duplications across chromosomes hs5, hs4, and hs6, represented by green and blue links, with row stratification. A detailed "Region of Interest" focuses on a genomic range between 68,000,000 to 71,000,000 bp with further duplications, highlighting inter-chromosomal connections. The "Rearrangement View" isolates an area from 69,276,000 to 69,282,000 bp, visualizing structural reorganization in bold arcs. Brushes enable cross-navigation among these linked views, providing an interactive exploration of chromosomal duplications and rearrangements.
