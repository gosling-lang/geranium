The visualization is a circular bar chart representing genomic intervals on chromosome 12, ranging from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. It visualizes multivec data with rows representing various samples, excluding those labeled as "sample -". The chart is stratified by rows with each row colored to indicate different categories using a nominal color scheme. The expression values, represented by the height of the bars, are segmented into multiple domains. Each domain has a different opacity to denote various ranges of 'peak' values, from 0 to 0.01, segmented further into smaller intervals. The visualization is constructed with an overlay alignment and spacing set to 1. The radial layout provides a compact view that utilizes a center radius of 0.3, offering a comprehensive depiction of the dataset's quantitative aspects with an overall width and height of 1152. The description emphasizes the reference to Javed et al.'s study on the graphical perception of multiple time series.
