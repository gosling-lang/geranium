A visualization titled "Visual Linking" demonstrates genomic data across three distinct chart types. At the top, a linear area chart displays multiple samples from chromosome 1, each stratified by category and color-coded in blue, orange, green, and red. A dynamic brush overlays the view, controlling the linked details below. Adjacent is a circular line chart of the same data, with lines in corresponding colors, reflecting sample peaks over the chromosome's length. The interactive brush links to the bottom scatter plot. This scatter plot offers a detailed view of a specific chromosome 1 region (positions 160,000,000 to 200,000,000), depicting points color-coded by category. Together, these charts allow exploration of genomic expression patterns through interactive linking.
