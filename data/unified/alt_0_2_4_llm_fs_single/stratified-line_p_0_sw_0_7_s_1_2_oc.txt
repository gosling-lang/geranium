A linear chart in a vertical arrangement visualizes multivec data showing chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The chart includes four rows for 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4,' each represented by differently colored lines and points. Genomic positions are on the x-axis, while expression values are on the y-axis, with point sizes indicating expression height. Tooltip information displays genomic position, peak value, and sample category.
