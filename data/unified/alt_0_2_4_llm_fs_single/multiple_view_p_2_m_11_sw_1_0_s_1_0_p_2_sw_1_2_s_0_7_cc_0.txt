The visualization consists of a vertically arranged layout featuring two main views: a circular composite and a linear composite. The circular view encompasses a line chart with colored lines representing four categories ('sample 1' to 'sample 4') in distinct hues of blue, orange, green, and red. This circular chart covers the entirety of chromosome 1 and includes a brush for selecting regions, influencing the details displayed below. Adjacent to it, the linear view exhibits an area chart, also employing the brush interaction to select genomic ranges. Beneath these, a detailed linear view presents a scatter plot focusing on a specific region of chromosome 1, from 160,000,000 to 200,000,000. Data points within this plot are color-coded consistently with the categories above. The title 'Visual Linking' and subtitle indicate interactivity, where adjustments to the brush modify the detailed scatter plot view below.
