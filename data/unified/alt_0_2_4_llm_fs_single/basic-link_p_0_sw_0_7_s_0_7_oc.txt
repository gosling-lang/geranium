The visualization is a linear layout titled "Basic Marks: Link," which illustrates genomic data on chromosome 1. It uses a CSV data file to render connections between specified genomic intervals, represented as arcs. The arcs span genomic positions defined by the start and end points on the x-axis, specifically for chromosome 1. These links are styled with a steelblue stroke, and the chart is part of the "Tutorial Examples" series. The dataset sources from a URL linking to a CSV file containing genomic fields. The visualization's assembly is hg38, with specified axis and orientation to ensure an informative representation of genomic connections.
