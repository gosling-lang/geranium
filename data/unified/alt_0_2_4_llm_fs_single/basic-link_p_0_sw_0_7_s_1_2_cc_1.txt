The visualization displays a chart with genomic connections in a linear layout, titled "Basic Marks: Link" with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples." It visualizes data from a CSV file containing chromosome, start, and end positions. The chart focuses on chromosome 1, highlighting connections between two genomic intervals using arcs. These arcs are displayed in lavender, providing a visual link between genomic positions. The visualization is designed in a horizontal format, with assembly hg38 and includes axis labels on top for genomic coordinates. The layout allows for interactive exploration with zoom, emphasizing the connectivity within chromosome 1.
