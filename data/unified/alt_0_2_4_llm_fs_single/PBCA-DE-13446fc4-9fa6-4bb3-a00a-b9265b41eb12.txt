The visualization consists of two arrangementsâ€”a circular view and a linear view, aligned vertically. The circular view, titled "Ideogram," encompasses the entire genome of the hg19 assembly and features multiple tracks. This includes a circular ideogram with a blue interactive brush linked to the linear view. The additional tracks are "Putative Driver" displaying gene annotations in black text, and two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" represented by blue and orange rectangles respectively. These annotations indicate genomic regions of interest. Further, a withinLink track visualizes structural variations between genomic positions using lines in varied colors, indicating categories like Translocation, Duplication, and Deletion.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and showcases similar tracks. The "Ideogram" is followed by "Putative Driver" as a text track. Below this, a point mutation scatterplot titled "Point Mutation" displays genomic positions against mutation distances, color-coded by mutation subtype such as C>A, C>G, and C>T. The following range annotation track denotes insertions and deletions with yellow and green rectangles. The "Copy Number Variants" track represents quantitative data with lightgrey rectangles. Additional tracks maintain continuity with the titles "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," echoing the circular view's annotations.
