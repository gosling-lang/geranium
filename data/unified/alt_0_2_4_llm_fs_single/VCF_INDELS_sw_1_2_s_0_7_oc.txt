The visualization is a horizontal bar chart displaying insertions and deletions extracted from a VCF file, covering multiple chromosomes. The title "Insertions and deletions from a VCF file" is displayed above the chart. Each row corresponds to a specific mutation type: 'Insertion' is shown in orange, and 'Deletion' is shown in green. The x-axis represents genomic positions, annotated with chromosome labels (e.g., chr1, chr4). The chart uses rectangles colored based on the mutation type to illustrate their occurrence, with white text annotations indicating the reference and alternate alleles. Transparency and overlay techniques are used for visibility adjustments based on zoom level, providing clear information on the mutation distribution across the genome.
