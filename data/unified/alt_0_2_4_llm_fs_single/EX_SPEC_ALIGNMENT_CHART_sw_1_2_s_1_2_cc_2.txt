The visualization consists of a linear alignment chart with two main views. The first view contains three tracks: a "Gap" bar chart, a "Conservation" bar chart, and a multi-row chart representing sequences. The "Gap" chart uses sky blue bars to denote gaps between genomic intervals on the y-axis. The "Conservation" chart shows conservation scores with a hot color gradient. The sequence chart stratifies sequences by rows, with distinct colors indicating different nucleotide bases. The second view is an overlaid chart, using rectangles and bars to depict the overall alignment from different perspectives, featuring categories' color coding. An interactive brush links the two views, allowing navigation across the genomic intervals.
