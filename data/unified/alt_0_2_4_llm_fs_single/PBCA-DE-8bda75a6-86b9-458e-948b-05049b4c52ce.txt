The visualization comprises two main views: a circular ideogram and a linear genomic representation, both based on the hg19 assembly. The circular view acts as an overview of the genome, using a circular ideogram with linked genomic intervals highlighted in light blue, representing 'Gain,' and dark orange for 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH).' Superimposed are genomic links depicting structural variants categorized by color, including 'Translocation' and 'Inversion,' which are differentiated by green and purple lines, among others. 

The linear view provides detailed insights into chromosome 1, segmented into multiple tracks. The top track features chromosome banding, where a blue brush indicates linked regions corresponding to the circular overview. Below, annotated 'Putative Driver' genes are displayed as black text labels over genomic intervals. A scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' visualizes mutations from a VCF file, with points colored according to mutation subtypes, such as 'C>A' or 'T>G.' Underneath are tracks for 'Insertion' and 'Deletion,' using colored rectangles to denote different mutation types. 

The 'Copy Number Variants' track shows variations using gray bars, quantitatively expressing 'total_cn' data. Additional tracks detail specific variants like 'Gain,' and 'LOH,' illustrated with sky blue and orange rectangles respectively. Connections between genomic points are visualized with arches, categorized by 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' and more, in the bottom-most track, enhancing the examination
