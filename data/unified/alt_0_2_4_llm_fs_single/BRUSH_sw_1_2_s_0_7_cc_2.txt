The visualization consists of two line charts arranged vertically, titled "Example: Brushing and Linking." Both charts are presented in a linear layout and visualize genomic data from chromosome 1 using a multivec file. The top chart displays the entire chromosome 1, with expression values represented by purple lines. It features a blue interactive brush for linking with the lower chart. The bottom chart zooms into a specific interval between 200,000,000 and 220,000,000, displaying expression values with green lines. Both charts offer genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative expression levels on the y-axis.
