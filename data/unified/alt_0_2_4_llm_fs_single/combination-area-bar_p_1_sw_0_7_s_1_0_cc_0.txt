The visualization presents a genomic data layout in a linear arrangement with two distinct tracks, showing the chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a stacked bar chart with bars representing the range of expression values (peak_min to peak_max) across four samples, each color-coded (blue, orange, green, red for samples 1 to 4, respectively). Each sample is stratified by its row, with the genomic positions on the x-axis. The bottom track is an area chart, displaying continuous expression values across the same samples, preserving the same color scheme. Both tracks are rich in interactivity, showing detailed genomic coordinates and expression values on hover, with a focus on facilitating comparison across the samples.
