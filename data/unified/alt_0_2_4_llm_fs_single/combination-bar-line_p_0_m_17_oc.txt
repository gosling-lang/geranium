The visualization is a multi-track linear layout showing genomic data on chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The top track features a bar chart with colors representing four different samples. The x-axis denotes genomic positions, while the y-axis displays quantitative expression values. The bottom track combines an area chart and a scatter plot with points, stratified by rows based on the samples. The color and size of the points correspond to the sample categories and expression values, providing a detailed view of genomic expression across samples. The overall layout is vertical, emphasizing a detailed comparative analysis between sample groups.
