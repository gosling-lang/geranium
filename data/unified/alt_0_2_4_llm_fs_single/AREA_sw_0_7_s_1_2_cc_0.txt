The visualization is an area chart in a linear layout displaying genomic data from a multivec file across the entire genome of hg38. The chart uses the 'peak' field for both the x-axis (genomic position) and the y-axis (quantitative value). The area is shaded in pink, providing insights into expression levels. The chart is titled "Basic Marks: area" with a subtitle "Tutorial Examples," and it spans a width of 672 pixels, highlighting genomic data for "sample 1."
