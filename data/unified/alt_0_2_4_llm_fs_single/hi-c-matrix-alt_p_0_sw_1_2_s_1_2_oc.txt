The visualization features a Hi-C matrix for genomic data over chromosome intervals from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000. It uses an overlay of multiple tracks to display data in a linear layout. The matrix track encodes genome position on both axes, with expression levels represented by color intensity in a grey scale. Annotations include red vertical lines and blue horizontal lines marking specific genomic positions. Additional overlaid bar charts depict genomic intervals with categories distinguished by stroke color. A scatter plot overlay uses steel blue points with size encoding expression magnitude. The overall structure highlights relationships within data through visual encoding, aiding in complex genomic analysis, as evidenced by the title "Hi-C Matrix" and subtitle "Visualize Hi-C Data Using Matrix and Annotations."
