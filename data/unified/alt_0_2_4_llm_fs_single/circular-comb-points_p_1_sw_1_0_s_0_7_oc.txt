A circular layout visualization displays genomic data from chromosome 1. There are two circular scatter plots. The left plot shows expression values as points, with size and y-axis encoding the 'peak' data field. Color represents sample categories, shown in a legend. The right plot stratifies by rows based on categories with similar color encoding for samples. The plots use a genomic x-axis, and the data spans from position 1 to 3,000,500. The opacity of points is set to 0.5, and tooltips provide additional genomic and quantitative information.
