The visualization consists of two vertically arranged genomic tracks focusing on chromosome 3, between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The left track, titled 'IGV,' visualizes gene annotations as text and rectangles with directional indicators for strand orientation. The genes are shown in navy blue, utilizing triangles for directional cues. The right track presents a detailed breakdown of genomic components, displaying exons in pink, introns in silver, and the overall gene structure in gray rectangles. Both tracks are stratified by strand (positive and negative) and are interactive, allowing a closer look at the intervals. The visualization is presented in a linear layout, adopting a horizontal arrangement for comparative purposes. The assembly used is hg38.
