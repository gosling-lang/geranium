The visualization is a circular genome plot, showcasing connections between genomic positions on chromosome 1 from 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. The layout is vertical with a centered circular arrangement, and the entirety of the genome is displayed. Connections are colored categorically, representing different data classifications. Opacity and stroke width provide visual distinction, with a black stroke outlining each connection. The plot is static, emphasizing the chromosomal intervals and interactions.
