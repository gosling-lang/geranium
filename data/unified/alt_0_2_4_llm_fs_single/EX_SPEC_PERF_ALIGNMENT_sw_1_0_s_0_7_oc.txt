A visualization titled "Smoother Zoom" uses a linear layout to present a comparative analysis of genomic data rendering approaches. The visualization consists of two vertically arranged views: "New Approach: Stretching Tiles" and "Original Approach." Each view uses a rectangular color-coded heatmap to represent genomic sequences from a CSV file. 

The x-axis displays genomic positions, focusing on the interval from 350 to 396. The y-axis is stratified by nominal categories, without legend, differentiating samples by the 'name' field. Each rectangle is colored based on the 'base' field, with a range of 20 colors coded in hexadecimal. Text annotations display genomic base information, overlaying the rectangles, with conditional visibility for zoom levels less than 10. 

The "New Approach" uses stretching graphics instead of redrawing for performance optimization during zoom, marked experimentally, while the "Original Approach" maintains traditional rendering. Both views have a width of 560 and a height of 310. The subtitle emphasizes scaling existing elements over redrawing.
