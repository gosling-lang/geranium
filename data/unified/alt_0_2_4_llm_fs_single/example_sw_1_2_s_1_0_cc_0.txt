The visualization titled "Visual Encoding" demonstrates various visual encoding methods provided by Gosling using a linear layout. The visualization is organized vertically, covering chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. It comprises nine distinct tracks, each visualizing genomic data from a multivec file.

1. The first track uses a heatmap to display genomic intervals along the x-axis, with expression values represented by color intensity, stratified by rows for categories labeled 'sample 1' to 'sample 4.'

2. The second and third tracks feature bar charts with genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. The bars are colored to indicate different samples, with the third track adding a grid for better insight.

3. The fourth track showcases an overlay of a line chart and scatter plot, where points' sizes reflect expression values.

4. The fifth and sixth tracks include two distinct scatter plots, showing points on the y-axis that convey both expression and size, with colors differentiating the samples.

5. In the seventh track, an area chart displays genomic data, using color to represent various categories and incorporating a white stroke for the data's outline.

6. The eighth track presents a bar chart with genomic intervals, where values are depicted with bars spanning the y- and y-e-axes, categorized by sample.

7. The final track utilizes a connection chart, showing genomic intervals on the x-axis while the color of connections signifies different categories.
