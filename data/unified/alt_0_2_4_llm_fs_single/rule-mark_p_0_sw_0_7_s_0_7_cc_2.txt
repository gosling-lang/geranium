The visualization titled "Rule Mark" features a linear layout with overlaid tracks, annotated by horizontal and vertical lines. A bar chart displays genomic data with sky-blue bars representing expression levels, ranging from 0 to 0.003 on the y-axis. Two sets of rule marks are overlaid: one with purple horizontal and vertical lines indicating expression values, and the other with green vertical lines, providing additional genomic annotations. The chart visualizes data for chromosome positions, enhancing interpretability with dashed lines for stylistic emphasis.
