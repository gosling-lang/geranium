The visualization is a circular area chart showcasing multivec data focused on chromosome 12, spanning positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. It features 16 color-coded samples with categories like 'sample 1', 'sample 2', and more, displayed in distinct colors such as blue, orange, and green. The chart has multiple layers, each representing different quantitative 'peak' domains. These are arranged in stratified rows, conveying genomic expression values through areas of varying opacity, providing a comprehensive view of the data in a compact, circular format. The reference is from Javed et al., highlighting graphical perception of multiple time series.
