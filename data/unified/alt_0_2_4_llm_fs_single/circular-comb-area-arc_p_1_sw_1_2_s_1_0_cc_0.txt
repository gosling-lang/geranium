A circular layout visualization shows the genomic intervals of chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500 in two interconnected views. The left track illustrates connections between genomic regions using a withinLink mark, where colors indicate different categories based on the 's1' field. The right track presents an area chart stratified by rows for four samples, 'sample 1' to 'sample 4', each colored uniquely. The area chart's x-axis represents genomic positions, while the y-axis reflects quantitative expression values ('peak') for each sample. The visualization utilizes a multivec file for data representation.
