A circular area chart visualizes a multivec file, presenting genomic data from chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart consists of multiple overlaid tracks and is stratified into 16 categories labeled from 'sample 1' to 'sample 16', excluding 'sample -'. Each track is colored uniquely corresponding to these categories. The y-axis represents the expression levels segmented into different ranges with varying opacities to highlight the peaks. This chart is part of a study on graphical perception of multiple time series, as referenced in Javed et al., TVCG 2010.
