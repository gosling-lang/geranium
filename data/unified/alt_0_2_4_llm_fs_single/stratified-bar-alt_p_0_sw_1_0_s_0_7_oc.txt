The visualization is a linear bar chart displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The data is categorized by four samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4'), each represented by a distinct color. The x-axis shows genomic intervals, while the y-axis displays the range of expression values between minimum and maximum peaks. Each sample is stratified in rows, with tooltip information highlighting position, minimum, and maximum peak values, and sample name. The bars are outlined in black with a subtle stroke width, enhancing clarity and definition.
