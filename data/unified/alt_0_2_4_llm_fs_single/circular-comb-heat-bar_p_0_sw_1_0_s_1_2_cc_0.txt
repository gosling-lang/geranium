**Description:**

This visualization features a circular arrangement with two horizontal views, each containing circular tracks. The left track is a heat map where genomic intervals on the x-axis are represented, and the intensity of color encodes expression values using a color gradient from light to dark, based on the 'peak' value. This track displays data stratified by four categories ('sample 1' to 'sample 4'), organized as separate rows. The right track is a circular bar chart, also displaying genomic data where intervals are shown on the x-axis. The height of the bars on the y-axis represents quantitative expression values. Each category ('sample 1' to 'sample 4') is identified by distinct colors: blue, orange, green, and red, which correspond to different samples. The visualization is titled and bordered with outline styling, facilitating easy visual comparison and category distinction.
