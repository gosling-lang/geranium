The Circos visualization displays a genomic dataset in a circular layout, divided into three main tracks. The outermost track features a bar chart where genomic positions are plotted on the x-axis, with quantitative peaks represented on the y-axis in pink bars. The middle track consists of a circular ideogram using data from the UCSC HG38 Human CytoBand, where intervals correspond to different chromosomes. These intervals are color-coded according to genomic stain categories such as gneg, gpos25, and gpos50, among others. The innermost track includes connections between genomic regions, visualized as lines that vary in color based on the chromosome field 'chr_2', highlighting the interchromosomal relationships in the data set. The visualization is static and spans a width and height of 588 units.
