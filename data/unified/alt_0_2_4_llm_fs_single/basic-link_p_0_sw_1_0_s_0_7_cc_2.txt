The visualization is a linear genomic layout titled "Basic Marks: Link," with a subtitle "Tutorial Examples." It shows connections between genomic positions on chromosome 1 from a CSV dataset. The arcs represent links between two sets of genomic intervals. The dataset is loaded via a URL and utilizes fields such as "s1," "e1," "s2," and "e2." The connections are visualized using arcs colored in green (#85B348). The visual encoding aligns genomic positions along the x-axis, annotating the domain with two chromosome positions (100,000,000 and 200,000,000). The orientation is horizontal, with fixed dimensions of 560 by 156 pixels, supporting dynamic zooming.
