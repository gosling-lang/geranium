A circular bar chart in a circular layout visualizes a vector file, displaying genomic data of hg38. The position of each bar represents a genomic location, and the height represents the 'peak' value. The bars are colored sky blue. The chart is static, with a center radius of 0.3, and aligned in a stack. The x-axis is marked at the top, and the y-axis encodes the quantitative 'peak' data. The visual is rendered at a size of 840x840 pixels.
