The visualization consists of a linear layout with two stacked views, each representing genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The top chart is a scatter plot with data points encoding 'peak' values from a multivec file. Points are sized by 'peak', colored according to 'sample' categories, and presented against a grid for clarity. The chart includes a legend illustrating four samples distinguished by blue, orange, green, and red. The y-axis represents quantitative expression values, with genomic positions on the x-axis.

The bottom chart similarly represents genomic data as a scatter plot but stratifies points by sample category into separate rows. Points are sized by 'peak' and categorized by color, with decreased opacity for visual layering. Comprehensive tooltips provide additional genomic and quantitative data for each point. Both plots facilitate intricate exploration of these genomic datasets within the defined interval of chromosome 1.
