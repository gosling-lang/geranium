The visualization consists of two charts within a circular layout, representing genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500 using a multivec file. 

The left chart is a circular bar chart, where the genome is mapped on the x-axis and expression levels are displayed on the y-axis with bars. These bars are colored to represent four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', in yellow, cyan, blue, and pink respectively. 

The right chart combines a circular line chart and a circular scatter plot. It similarly maps the genome on the x-axis and expression levels on the y-axis, illustrated by lines and points. Each category is represented by a distinct color. Additionally, point sizes are determined by the expression values, with the chart segmented into rows by category. 

Both charts include tooltips that provide genomic position, value, and sample information on hover, enhancing interactivity.
