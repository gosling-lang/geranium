The visualization is a multivec bar chart laid out linearly, displaying genomic data of chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 of the hg38 assembly. The x-axis presents genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative peak values. The chart includes bars colored by samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4'), and each color signifies a different sample category. Tooltips provide additional information on genomic start and end positions, peak value, and sample category. The chart is 720 pixels wide and 160 pixels high.
