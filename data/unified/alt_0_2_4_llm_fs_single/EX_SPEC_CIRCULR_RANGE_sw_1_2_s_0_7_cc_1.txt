A circular bar chart in a stacked layout visualizes a vector data file, showing the entire genome of hg38. The position of bars is encoded using the data field named 'position,' while the height represents the 'peak' values. The bars are colored in sky blue. The chart features a top axis with genomic coordinates, with a center radius of 0.3. The visualization is static with specified dimensions of 588x588, and the bars are arranged circularly, illustrating genomic data distribution across chromosomes.
