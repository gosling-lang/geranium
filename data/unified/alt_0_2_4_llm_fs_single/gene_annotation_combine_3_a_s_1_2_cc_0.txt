The visualization consists of three genomic range annotation tracks in a linear layout, displaying data from chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. The first track, titled "Cyverse-QUBES," utilizes various shapes to represent genomic features: pink text and right triangles for gene annotations on the positive strand, sky blue left triangles for negative strands, purple rectangles for gene bodies, and green rectangles for exons. The second track focuses on genomic range annotations with sky blue rectangles indicating genes and green rectangles for exons. The third track, labeled "GmGDV," showcases gene annotations with text in different colors representing strands, blue for the positive and orange for the negative. The strands are further differentiated by right and left triangles along with rectangle bars. Each track is stratified by the strand orientation, providing a comprehensive view of gene and exon distribution across the specified genomic interval.
