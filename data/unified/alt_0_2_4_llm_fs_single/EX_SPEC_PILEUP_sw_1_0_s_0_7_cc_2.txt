The visualization displays two tracks in a linear layout, utilizing BAM file data focusing on chromosome 1 between genomic coordinates 136,750 and 139,450. The title is "Pileup Track Using BAM Data." The upper track is a coverage chart shown as a bar plot with silver bars, representing the read counts aligned to the genome. The lower track is a pileup chart visualized with rectangles. This track is organized into rows representing different categories based on structural variations, including 'normal read', 'deletion (+-)', 'inversion (++)', 'inversion (--)', 'duplication (-+)', 'more than two mates', 'mates not found within chromosome', and 'clipping.' Each category is color-coded, with colors like gray, orange, green, and others to denote different types of structural variations. The width of the display is 875 pixels and the height is 506.01 pixels.
