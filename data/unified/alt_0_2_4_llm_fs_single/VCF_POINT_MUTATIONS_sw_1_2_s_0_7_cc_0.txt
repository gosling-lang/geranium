The visualization is a linear scatter plot that showcases point mutations derived from a VCF file. The x-axis displays genomic positions spanning several chromosomes, while the y-axis represents the logarithmic distance to the previous mutation. Each point in the plot is colored according to the type of nucleotide substitution, with categories including "C>A," "C>G," "C>T," "T>A," "T>C," and "T>G." These colors range from blue and orange to green and red. The arrangement is vertical with a center radius of 0.8, and the plot includes interactive tooltips highlighting the genomic position and log-transformed distance information. The chart is set against the hg38 genome assembly. The subtitle of the visualization is "Point mutations from a VCF file."
