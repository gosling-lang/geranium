The visualization consists of two integrated views: a circular and a linear view, showcasing genomic data from human genome assembly hg19. The circular view at the top highlights various genomic features like an ideogram, textual annotations labeled as "Putative Driver," and chromosomal regions depicted as colored rectangles. The annotations are in black, while regions such as "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" are represented by sky blue and dark orange rectangles, respectively. Structural variations are displayed as arcs colored according to categories like "Translocation" and "Duplication."

Below, the linear view focuses on chromosome 1, with tracks showing text annotations, mutation scatter plots, and range annotations. "Point Mutation" showcases variations with dots colored by mutation subtype. Rows named "Insertion" and "Deletion" use yellow and green bars, while the "Copy Number Variants" track uses grey rectangles to represent quantitative data. The interactive brush on the x-axis aligns both views, enhancing navigation and detail exploration.
