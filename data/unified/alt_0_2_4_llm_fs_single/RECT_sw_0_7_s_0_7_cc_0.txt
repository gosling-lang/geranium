The visualization showcases a genomic ideogram for chromosome 1, using a linear layout. It is titled "Basic Marks: Rect" with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples". The ideogram is represented by colored rectangles along the x-axis, each color indicating a specific category defined by the "Stain" field in the data. The dataset is a CSV file sourced from UCSC HG38 Human CytoBand Ideogram. The color categorization uses a nominal scale with a specified domain and range, featuring colors like blue, orange, green, red, purple, and brown. The chart includes genomic intervals along the x-axis, with each interval marked by its start ("chromStart") and end ("chromEnd") positions, while the y-axis is set to a constant value of 20 for size. The rectangles have a gray stroke outline of 0.5 width, enhancing visual distinction. The interactive nature of the chart allows for dynamic exploration of genomic data.
