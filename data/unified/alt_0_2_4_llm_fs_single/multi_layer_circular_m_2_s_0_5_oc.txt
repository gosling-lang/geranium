A circular area chart visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The data is stratified into multiple rows, each corresponding to different samples. The values are displayed using areas, with each sample represented by a distinct color. The chart encodes quantitative data using the field 'peak' on the y-axis. The visualization employs a circular layout with an emphasis on clear differentiation of categories, highlighting genomic regions in the dataset.
