A circular scatter plot displays a multivec file, showing a portion of chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The visualization is arranged in multiple concentric rings, each representing samples categorized into distinct rows. Data points (or "peaks") are plotted within these rings, with the y-value corresponding to expression levels. Each ring is colored differently, representing various samples. The scatterplot uses the hg38 assembly, and points are distributed radially around the circle.
