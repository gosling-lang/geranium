A visualization with a linear layout, titled "BED files," demonstrates the use of BED files with different specifications. Four vertical tracks represent various BED file formats on chromosome 1 from position 1 to 2,000,000. Each track uses rectangles to display genomic intervals. The first track, titled "BED12: All 12 standard fields," shows data in sky blue. The second, "BED6: A file with the first 6 BED fields," uses green. The third, "BED6+6: A file with the first 6 BED fields, and 6 custom fields," is depicted in purple, and the fourth, "BED12+1: A file with all 12 standard fields, and a single extra custom field," reuses sky blue.
