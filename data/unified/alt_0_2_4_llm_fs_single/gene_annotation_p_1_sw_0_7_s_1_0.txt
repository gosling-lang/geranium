The visualization consists of six genomic range annotation tracks organized in a horizontal layout, showcasing the portion of chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. Each track is split into rows based on the strand direction ('+' or '-') and is labeled with various titles (e.g., "Corces et al.," "IGV," "HiGlass"). Gene annotations are displayed using text, rectangles, triangles, and rules, with distinct color coding for positive and negative strands. Exon and intron information are represented as rectangles, with exons highlighted in specific colors like purple or red. Additionally, different styles such as line patterns (e.g., triangle shapes) are used to indicate strand orientation. The tracks are annotated with both genomic positions and the names of the displayed genes.
