A visualization titled "Rule Mark" displays a multivec file in a linear layout with horizontal and vertical lines for annotation. The view consists of three overlaid tracks. The first track is a bar chart showing the genome in intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, with purple-colored bars denoting the peaks. Overlaid on this are two sets of rules or lines: one set uses lines with varying thicknesses based on quantitative values, while the other consists of uniformly thick vertical lines. Both rule sets use pink for coloring and serve as markers on the genomic x-axis, indicating specific positions and values. The style includes a dashed line pattern. The chart spans chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 8, 12, 15, and 19, with visualization data sourced from the hg38 genome assembly.
