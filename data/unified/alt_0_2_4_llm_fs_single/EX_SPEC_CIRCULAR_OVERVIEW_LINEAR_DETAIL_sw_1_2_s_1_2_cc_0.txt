The visualization consists of a vertical arrangement of circular and linear views. The circular view stacks two tracks and displays genomic data for multiple samples. Each track is stratified by sample categories, with distinct colors for each sample. The outer circular track features bar marks showing 'peak' values along genomic positions, with interactive brushes linking to detailed linear views below. The inner circular track uses within-link marks to represent genomic rearrangements, with strokes indicating types of rearrangements like deletions and inversions. The linear views present more detailed bar charts for chromosomes 5 and 16, also stratified by sample categories. These views use specific background styling and are linked interactively to the circular view through brushes. The entire display provides a comprehensive genomic overview, leveraging multivec and CSV data sources to convey complex structural variations and quantitative measures across different chromosomes.
