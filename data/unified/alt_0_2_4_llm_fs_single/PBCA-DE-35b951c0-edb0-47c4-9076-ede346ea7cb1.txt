The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view, linked by an interactive blue brush in the circular view. The circular view displays the entire genome using tracks such as an ideogram, a point annotation track titled 'Putative Driver', two range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' (sky blue rectangles) and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' (orange rectangles), and a line-connection track showing structural variations classified as 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion'.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1 and includes a range of tracks: an ideogram, 'Putative Driver' text annotations, gene structures, a scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation' representing a VCF file (color-coded by mutation subtype), and multiple range annotation tracks for 'Insertion', 'Deletion', and 'Copy Number Variants' (CNVs shown as gray rectangles). Structural variations are indicated with connecting lines, colored by categories using the data field 'svclass', with an embedded legend. The layout is vertical, enabling an exploratory analysis of genomic data.
