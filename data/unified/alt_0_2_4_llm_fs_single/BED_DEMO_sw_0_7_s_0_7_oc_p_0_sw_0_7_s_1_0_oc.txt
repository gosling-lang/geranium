A linear layout visualization of BED files shows data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 2,000,000. The layout consists of four vertically arranged tracks, each displaying genomic intervals as black-stroked rectangles:

1. **BED12**: Uses all 12 standard BED fields.
2. **BED6**: Features the first six BED fields.
3. **BED6+6**: Displays the first six BED fields plus six custom fields.
4. **BED12+1**: Includes all 12 standard BED fields and one additional custom field.

Each track is labeled with its respective BED specification, marked with consistent rectangle sizes and black outlines to represent genomic intervals.
