The visualization consists of five linear tracks, with each track corresponding to chromosomes 1 through 5. Each track includes an area chart overlayed on top of an ideogram.

### Area Chart
- **Data Source:** The charts use a multivec file with rows as samples and columns as genomic positions.
- **Displays:** The area chart shows expression values (y-axis) across varying genomic positions (x-axis) for different categories represented by samples. 
- **Color Encoding:** Categories are distinguished by colors: blue, orange, green, and red, corresponding to 'sample 1' through 'sample 4'.

### Ideogram and Overlay
- **Data Source:** The ideograms use CSV data detailing cytogenetic bands.
- **Visual Elements:**
  - **Rectangles:** Colored to indicate density and other stain characteristics, using shades of white to black and light purple for gvar.
  - **Triangles:** Maroon right and left triangles denote acen regions.
  - **Text:** Names of chromosome bands are displayed in black.

### Overall Layout
- **Configuration:** Parallel arrangement with a static and centered radius of 0.2.
- **Size:** Varies per chromosome track to accommodate data; dimensions are specific to genomic extent.
  
This visualization provides a comprehensive genomic overview across five chromosome tracks, combining categorical expression data with a detailed cytogenetic band representation.
