This visualization consists of five individual tracks arranged linearly along the x-axis, representing chromosome 1. The first track is an ideogram with colored rectangles and triangles that signify different genomic regions and categories, using the hg38 assembly. The second track displays gene annotations with right-facing and left-facing triangles representing positive and negative strands, respectively, with a color range featuring blue and orange based on strand categories. The third and fourth tracks use pink rectangles to indicate genomic intervals from a CSV file, representing minor copy number variations and total copy number variations in tumor samples. The final track visualizes genomic rearrangements with connections in varying colors and strokes based on the structural variant class, including tandem duplications, translocations, deletions, and inversions.
