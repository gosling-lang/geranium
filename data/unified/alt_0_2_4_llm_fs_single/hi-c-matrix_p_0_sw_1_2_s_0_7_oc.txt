The visualization titled "Hi-C Matrix" showcases genomic interactions using a matrix layout combined with additional annotations. Positioned within the x-domain interval of 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000, it overlays multiple tracks in a linear format focused on the hg38 assembly.

1. **Matrix Track**: Displays the genome on both x- and y-axes as intervals with color intensity encoding expression values. Grey shades indicate varying quantitative data, supplying a comprehensive view of interaction intensity.

2. **Rule Tracks**: Vertical and horizontal lines adorn the x- and y-axes, colored red and blue respectively, delineating specific genomic positions for highlighted annotation, enhancing interpretative layering.

3. **Additional Bar and Point Tracks**: Include a bar chart contrasting genomic coordinates on both axes, utilizing quantitative data fields to color-code the centroid. Simultaneously, a scatter plot demonstrates genomic intervals where point size reveals data magnitude, colored in steel blue.

The presentation effectively utilizes overlay technique to enrich the exploratory and interpretational depth of complex genomic interaction, integrating both quantitative and categorical data dimensions.
