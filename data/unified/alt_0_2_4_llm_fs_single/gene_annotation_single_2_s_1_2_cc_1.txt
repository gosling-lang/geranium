The visualization is a linear genomic range annotation track titled "IGV" displaying a section of chromosome 3 from base pair 52,168,000 to 52,890,000, in a horizontal arrangement. The chart uses a BED file to show gene annotations. Genes are represented as text and rectangles colored in sky blue. The track is stratified by the strand, with positive and negative strands shown in different rows. White lines with triangular patterns indicate strand direction, with left triangles for negative strands and right triangles for positive strands. The visualization provides a clear representation of gene locations and orientations within this genomic interval.
