A circular scatter plot represents genomic data across chromosome 1, from position 1 to 3,000,500 on the hg38 assembly. The points are plotted based on the position and peak values found in a multivec file, with categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'. Each sample is distinguished by color, with yellow, orange, blue, and purple representing different categories. The size and opacity of the points are determined by the magnitude of the peak values, while the radial axis denotes quantitative expression values. A legend is present, providing color association for each sample.
