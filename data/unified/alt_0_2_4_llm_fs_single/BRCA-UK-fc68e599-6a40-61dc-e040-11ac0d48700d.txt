The visualization consists of a circular view and a linear view aligned vertically. The circular view, displaying the entire hg19 genome, includes tracks such as an ideogram indicating chromosome bands, a track for putative driver genes with text annotations, and tracks showing genomic gain and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) with colored rectangles (sky blue for gain, dark orange for LOH). A connections track displays structural variations like translocations, duplications, deletions, and inversions, represented by lines in colors corresponding to their category.

The circular view contains a blue interactive brush linking to the linear view. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, displaying a sequence of detailed tracks similar to the circular view but with added data granularity. It includes ideograms, driver annotations, and a gene annotation track with triangle glyphs representing gene directions. A scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" shows positions and distances to previous mutations using colored dots, representing different subtypes. Additional tracks include insertion and deletion annotations, copy number variants indicated by gray bars, and further details on structural variants with line connections. These views facilitate insight into genomic structures and variations, supported by interacting and hover features for detailed examination.
