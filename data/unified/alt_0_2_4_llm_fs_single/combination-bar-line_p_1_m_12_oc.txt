A vertical linear layout features two tracks visualizing multivec data for chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track combines a bar chart and a scatter plot, stratified by samples 'sample 1' to 'sample 4', represented with distinct colors. The x-axis depicts genomic positions, while the y-axis plots peak values. Bar heights and point sizes encode peak magnitudes. The bottom track is a scatter plot with similar sample stratification and color scheme, focusing solely on point representation across genomic positions with gridlines for enhanced data clarity.
