This visualization consists of two circular scatter plots representing genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. Each circular plot is in a horizontal arrangement, displaying genomic positions on the x-axis, while the y-axis and size of the points correspond to expression values. Both plots stratify data by four sample categories, each represented by a unique color: blue, orange, green, and red.

The left plot features rows for each sample, emphasizing categorized data representation. In contrast, the right plot includes a grid, enhancing the clarity of expression value distribution. The opacity of points is set to 0.5 to maintain visibility of overlapping data points.

Interactivity is supported through tooltips, which provide detailed information on start and end genomic positions, expression values, and sample categories. The visualization utilizes a multivec data type from an external URL, ensuring dynamic and comprehensive genomic data representation.
