A linear visualization contains two vertically arranged tracks, displaying genomic data for chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a multi-row bar chart, where each row represents a sample from the multivec file. The x-axis shows genomic intervals, with bars representing expression values over the 'peak_min' and 'peak_max' fields. Categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4' are distinguished by color, displayed in the legend. The bottom track is an area chart, with the x-axis showing genomic positions and the y-axis the 'peak' values. Both tracks are stratified by sample, color-coded, and include tooltips for detailed data points. The assembly used is hg38.
