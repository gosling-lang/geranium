The visualization features a linear layout representing chromosome 1. It consists of five distinct tracks. The first track showcases a genomic ideogram with color-coded bands and directional triangles based on cytogenetic staining patterns. The second track displays genomic annotation using left and right triangles to indicate gene orientations, stratified by strand. The third and fourth tracks illustrate copy number variants with blue and pink rectangles representing different genomic intervals affected by tumor-specific changes. Finally, the fifth track uses connections to depict genomic rearrangements, categorically colored by structural variant classes such as tandem-duplication and translocation.
