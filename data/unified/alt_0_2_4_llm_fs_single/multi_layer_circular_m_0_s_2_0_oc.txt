A circular scatter plot visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The plot contains multiple rows corresponding to different samples, specifically ‘sample 1’ through ‘sample 8’. Points represent data fields named 'peak' and are stratified by sample rows. Each point is colored differently according to its sample category. The layout is circular, and the visualization is rendered in a wide canvas with specified intervals on both the x-axis and y-axis.
