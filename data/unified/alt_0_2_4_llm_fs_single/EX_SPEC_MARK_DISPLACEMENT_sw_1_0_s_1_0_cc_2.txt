A visualization showing mark displacement techniques to handle visual overlap, structured across three linear tracks. The top track displays genes and exons from chromosome 3, positioned in a max of 15 rows using different shapes: right and left triangles, text, rectangles, and rules. The center track highlights 'Likely Benign' variants on chromosome 2, with green circles and text labels. It also includes gene annotations, visible as colored arrows for different strands. The bottom track overlays genomic data from chromosome 17, illustrating key values in different colors and shapes, such as blue and pink points, representing various clinical significances like 'Pathogenic' and 'Benign.' The title is "Mark Displacement" and the subtitle is "Reposition marks to address visual overlaps using displacement options."
