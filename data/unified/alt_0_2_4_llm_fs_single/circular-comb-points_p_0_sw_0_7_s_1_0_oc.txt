The visualization consists of two circular scatter plots arranged horizontally. Both plots display genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The left plot stratifies data from four samples ('sample 1' to 'sample 4') into separate rows, where each point's position and size correspond to a 'peak' value. Colors indicate samples, enhancing category differentiation. The right plot integrates all samples into a single circular track, with 'peak' values affecting point positions and sizes. Opacity is set to 0.5 to allow overlap visibility, and a legend clarifies sample colors.
