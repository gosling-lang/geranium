This visualization consists of two horizontally arranged circular charts focused on chromosome 1. The left chart displays genomic connections, spanning positions 103,900,000 to 104,100,000, with arcs colored to represent different categories. The right chart is an area chart displaying genomic data for samples 1 to 4, with expression peaks shown by colored areas. Each sample is displayed in a separate row, using unique colors (blue, orange, green, red) to represent categorical data. The genomic ranges are aligned to a consistent scale, highlighting specific intervals on the x-axis.
