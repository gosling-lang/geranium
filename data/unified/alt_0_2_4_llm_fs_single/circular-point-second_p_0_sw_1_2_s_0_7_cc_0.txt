The visualization is a circular scatter plot representing genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The chart uses points to show expression values on the y-axis, with additional information encoded in the size and color of the points. Four categories, labeled 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', are distinguished by different colors: blue, orange, green, and red. The x-axis represents the genomic positions, and a legend indicates the sample categories. Opacity is set at 0.5 for visual clarity, and a tooltip provides additional data such as start and end positions, peak values, and sample identifiers. The layout is static, indicating data is displayed without interactive zooming.
