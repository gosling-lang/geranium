A circular layout visualization displays genomic connections on chromosome 1 between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. The layout includes a single track that uses the "withinLink" mark type to connect regions on the chromosome. Connections are color-coded nominally based on the field "s1," with black outlines. The opacity of the links is set at 0.2, and the links have a thickness of 0.5 units. The visualization is static and centered around a radius of 0.5. The outer radius of the chart is approximately 85.75 units, clearly illustrating segmented duplication events.
