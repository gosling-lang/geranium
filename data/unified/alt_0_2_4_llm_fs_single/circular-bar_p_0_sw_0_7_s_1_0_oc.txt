"Circular bar chart visualizing genomic data from chromosome 1, covering an interval from 1 to 3,000,500. The chart is arranged vertically within a circular layout and presents data from two samples using a multivec format. Bars are colored based on sample categories, with heights representing minimum and maximum peak values. Genomic positions are illustrated concentrically along the x-axis. A legend distinguishes between the two samples. The visualization uses analysis from assembly hg38, and includes tooltips for genomic position, peak values, and sample identification."
