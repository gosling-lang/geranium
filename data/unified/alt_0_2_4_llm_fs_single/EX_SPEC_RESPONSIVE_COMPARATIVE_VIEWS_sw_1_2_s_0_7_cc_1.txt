A horizontally arranged set of three bar charts visualizes genomic data using a multivec file, focusing on specific chromosome regions. The first chart displays chromosome 12, ranging from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000, with bars colored green, depicting quantitative values from the 'peak' data field. The second chart represents chromosome 9 in the same range, with bars colored sky blue, while the third chart revisits chromosome 12, again using sky blue bars. All charts share consistent styling with white strokes for clarity, ensuring the arrangement adapts to width changes, flipping to a vertical layout if width is under 1200 pixels.
