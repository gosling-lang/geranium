The visualization titled "Single-cell Epigenomic Analysis" with the subtitle "Corces et al. 2020" is a linear, vertically arranged figure focusing on the chromosome 3 region between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. It contains multiple tracks displaying data related to different neuron types and cell lines using bar marks, colored specifically for Excitatory neurons (orange), Inhibitory neurons (green), Dopaminergic neurons (purple-blue), Microglia (sky blue), Oligodendrocytes (purple), Astrocytes (red), and OPCs (pink), sourced from bigwig files.

Additionally, the figure includes a genomic range annotation track for genes using text and rectangles, colored blue and red to denote strand direction. Three PLAC-seq tracks from Nott et al., highlighting interactions with subtle connections, are included with varying colors for strokes. A bottom ideogram for chromosome 3 provides a broader genomic context. The chart uses a linking brush to connect with detailed views, with text and outlines in a deep shade. Overall, the figure integrates multi-source genomic data for detailed epigenomic analysis.
