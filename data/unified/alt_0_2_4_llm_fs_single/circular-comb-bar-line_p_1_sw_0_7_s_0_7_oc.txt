A circular visualization displays genomic intervals from chromosome 1, between positions 1 and 3,000,500, using a multivec file. This chart has a vertical arrangement within a circular layout and features both line and scatter plots for four samples: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The lines and points are colored differently for each category, with the size of the points representing quantitative expression values. An additional circular bar chart shows expression levels with bars, further distinguished by sample category. Both charts have a nominal color legend and provide tooltips displaying genomic position, expression value, and sample category.
