The visualization comprises two vertically arranged linear charts focused on chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The upper chart displays a stacked bar plot where genomic positions on the x-axis correlate with quantitative expression data on the y-axis. Each bar represents one of four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', distinguished by colors: blue, orange, green, and red.

The lower chart overlays an area and line plot, stratified by sample categories. Each row corresponds to a sample category, with area fills and lines sharing category colors. Here, the y-axis represents expression values, depicted by both the height of area fills and line thickness. Tooltips in both charts reveal genomic positions and expression values, facilitating interactive exploration.
