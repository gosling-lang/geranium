A multi-track linear visualization illustrates genomic data using Gosling.js track templates. The first track presents a gene annotation on chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000, with genes displayed as gray triangles and rectangles stratified by strand direction. The second track visualizes sequence data from chromosome 1 between positions 77,925,299 and 77,925,320, showcasing base counts through colorful bars, with distinct shades representing different nucleotide bases. The final track displays an ideogram of the entire chromosome 1, highlighting cytobands with varying shades and a prominent q12 label in blue. The design smoothly integrates elements for clearer genomic interpretation, titled "Track Template In Gosling.js" with a note on the ease of creating complex visualizations.
