The chart represents the E. coli genome within the GFF3 file, focusing on the region from 222,000 to 240,000 of chromosome U00096.3. It utilizes a linear layout to display gene annotations, colored by gene type. The visualization incorporates various visual encodings: orange triangles indicate protein-coding genes, while blue, green, red, purple, and black represent tRNA, rRNA, ncRNA, pseudogenes, and unknown types, respectively.

The visualization stratifies data by strand, distinguishing forward and reverse strands into separate rows. Triangles at the ends of lines indicate gene direction, with rightward triangles for forward strands and leftward for reverse strands. Gene names are labeled above the lines, corresponding to their genomic positions.

The diagram's smooth path feature enhances readability, allowing viewers to discern gene types, positions, and orientations across the specified genome segment. This tool serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding gene distribution and type within the E. coli genome. The title "GFF3 file" and subtitle "E. coli genome, colored by gene type" highlight the chart's context and purpose.
