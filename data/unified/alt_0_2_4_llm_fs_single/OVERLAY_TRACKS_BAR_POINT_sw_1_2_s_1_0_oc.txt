The visualization, titled "Example: Overlay Tracks," is a linear layout presenting a representation of genomic data on chromosome 3. The chart overlays bars and points, with bars indicating genomic ranges and points representing individual data points. Data is categorized by "significance" (e.g., "Pathogenic," "Likely_pathogenic"), with each category color-coded, ranging from orange for pathogenic to green for benign. Both bar strokes and point colors reflect these categories, providing a visual distinction. The chart includes a legend explaining the color-coding, ensuring clarity and aiding interpretation of the genomic significance from a provided BEDDB file.
