The visualization titled "Visual Linking" consists of a scatter plot, area chart, and a circular line chart. It features a vertical arrangement with an interactive brush for linking views. The main scatter plot displays genomic positions on the x-axis and peak expression values on the y-axis, stratified by samples colored in blue, orange, green, and red. It covers chromosome 1 from positions 160,000,000 to 200,000,000. The area chart, aligned horizontally with the scatter plot, shows the genomic range of chromosome 1 in intervals, with a brush interaction linking to the scatter plot. The circular line chart, positioned on the right, also displays genomic intervals, with the categories differentiated by line color. This interactive visualization allows users to dynamically explore data across different genomic regions and sample categories.
