A linear bar chart overlayed with rule marks visualizes genomic data for assembly hg38. The main track displays a bar chart with positional genomic data on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis, with bars colored purple. Overlaying this are rule marks from JSON data, depicting vertical and horizontal lines. The vertical lines correspond to specific genomic positions across chromosomes 2, 5, and 10, colored in pink and green, with line widths reflecting quantitative values. The chart is titled "Rule Mark" with a subtitle "Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines," emphasizing the annotation feature using dashed styling.
