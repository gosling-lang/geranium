The visualization is a linear ideogram chart titled "Basic Marks: Rect" with a subtitle "Tutorial Examples". It depicts segments of chromosome 1 using rectangular marks. The rectangles' colors, ranging from white to black and light purple, indicate different stain categories. The x-axis displays the genomic intervals, and the chart utilizes a genomic CSV file for data input. Rectangles are outlined in gray for emphasis, showcasing diverse banding patterns of the chromosome, focusing on non-acen regions. The chart is 672 pixels wide and 28 pixels high.
