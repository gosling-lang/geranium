A multi-layered circular line chart visualizes genomic data from chromosome 12, spanning positions 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. Each concentric layer represents different samples, utilizing distinct colors such as blue, orange, green, red, and more. The x-axis encodes genomic positions, while the y-axis represents quantitative 'peak' values. The data originates from a multivec file, filtered to exclude specific samples, and displayed in a circular layout incorporating a genomic coordinate system. Distinct colors codify sample categories, facilitating visual differentiation.
