The linear visualization displays genomic data along chromosome 1 using five distinct tracks. The top track is an ideogram with colored rectangles and triangles indicating different chromosomal features based on a stain value. The second track shows genomic annotations, with strands represented by blue and orange triangles pointing in their respective directions. Two subsequent tracks represent copy number variations with blue rectangles for tumor minor copy number set to zero and pink rectangles for tumor total copy number within a specific range. The final track displays connections between genomic positions with lines, color and stroke indicating the structural variation classes such as tandem-duplication and translocation. The chart is interactive, linked to the "mid-scale" domain for chromosome 1 and uses the hg38 assembly.
