The visualization consists of a circular and a linear view, linked by an interactive brush. The circular view encompasses the entire genome, while the linear view zooms in on chromosome 1. The circular layout includes five tracks: an ideogram, a point annotation track, two range annotation tracks, and a connection track. The ideogram uses a color code to differentiate various chromosome regions.

The point annotation track, labeled 'Putative Driver,' displays data in text form. The first range annotation track, titled 'Gain,' highlights genomic periods with blue rectangles. The second track, labeled 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' showcases genomic periods with orange rectangles, indicating different genetic alterations.

The connection track illustrates lines linking genomic positions, color-coded to represent different 'svclass' categories like 'Gain,' 'LOH,' 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion.' These categories are also highlighted in the linear tracks below.

The linear view replicates the circular content with additional tracks, including a gene annotation track, a point mutation scatter plot, and multiple range annotation tracks. The scatter plot, 'Point Mutation,' showcases a VCF file visualizing mutation distances, with points colored by the 'SUBTYPE' field.

Range annotation tracks in the linear view include 'Insertion' and 'Deletion,' marked with yellow and green rectangles, and a 'Copy Number Variants' track using gray bars. This comprehensive visualization effectively communicates various genomic alterations, enabling detailed genetic analysis
