The visualization consists of two charts arranged vertically in a linear layout, covering chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top chart is a line chart where the genome is represented along the x-axis, and expression values are shown as lines on the y-axis. The lines are color-coded to represent four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The bottom chart is an overlay bar chart that stratifies the data by rows for each category. Bars represent expression values on the y-axis, with their colors corresponding to the same four categories. Each track offers tooltips that display genomic start and end positions, expression values, and category names. The data is visualized using the hg38 genome assembly, and interactive zooming is enabled.
