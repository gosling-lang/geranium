The visualization is a circular heat map titled "Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts" with the subtitle "Heatmap." It displays chromosome 1's genomic data from positions 1 to 3,000,500 using a multivec file in a circular layout. The heat map utilizes a color gradient to represent quantitative expression values, with color intensity indicating the magnitude of these values. The chart is arranged in rows signifying different samples: "sample 1," "sample 2," "sample 3," and "sample 4." Each sample has its own segment in the circular layout. The position is encoded on the x-axis, while the color represents the expression value (peak), with a quantitative legend provided. The heat map provides detailed tooltips for start and end genomic positions, sample category, and quantitative value. The layout is static, with a center radius of 0.5.
