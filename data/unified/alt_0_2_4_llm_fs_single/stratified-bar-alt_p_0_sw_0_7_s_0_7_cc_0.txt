A vertical arrangement of bar charts in a linear layout displays multivec data for chromosome 1, spanning a range from 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. Four color-coded rows represent different samples: 'sample 1' (blue), 'sample 2' (orange), 'sample 3' (green), and 'sample 4' (red). The tracks visualize the minimum and maximum peak values across the genomic range. The chart includes genomic intervals on the x-axis and peak values on the y-axis. Legend and tooltips enhance the interaction, providing detailed values and sample identification for each bar.
