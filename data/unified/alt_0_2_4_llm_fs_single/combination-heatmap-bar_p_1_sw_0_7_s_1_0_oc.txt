A vertically arranged linear layout displays two genomic tracks of chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a stratified bar chart featuring four samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 4'), with each sample represented by a different color. The height of the bars corresponds to the 'peak' value on the y-axis. The bottom track is a heat map visualizing the same samples as rows, where the expression values are encoded through color intensity, highlighting variations across samples in the same genomic region. The data is dynamically loaded from a multivec file.
