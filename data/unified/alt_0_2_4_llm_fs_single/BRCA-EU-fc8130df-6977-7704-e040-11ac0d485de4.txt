A dual view visualization featuring a circular and a linear layout, both linked by an interactive blue brush. The circular layout provides an overview of the entire genome, with five tracks illustrating various attributes. These include an ideogram track colored based on genomic bands, a 'Putative Driver' text track showing gene annotations, a 'Gain' track with blue rectangles indicating copy number gains, a 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' track with orange rectangles, and a connection track visualizing structural variations with color-coded links, representing categories like 'Gain', 'LOH', 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversions'.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, with nine tracks that include an ideogram with markers indicating strand direction, a gene annotation track with exons and gene labels, a 'Point Mutation' scatter plot indicating mutation distances, and two range annotation tracks displaying deletion and insertion events. The 'Copy Number Variants' track highlights variations in gray bars. Each track is meticulously detailed, providing a comprehensive genomic analysis.
