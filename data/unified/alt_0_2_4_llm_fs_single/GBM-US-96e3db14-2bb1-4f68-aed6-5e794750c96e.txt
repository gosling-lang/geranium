This dual-view visualization features a circular and linear layout, focusing on chromosome 1 of the human genome assembly hg19. The circular view showcases a genomic ideogram, text annotations for 'Putative Driver' genes, two range annotation tracks for 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)', and line connections indicating structural variations like ‘Translocation’ and ‘Duplication’. The colors represent different categories, such as blue for ‘Gain’ and orange for 'LOH'. A blue interactive brush links the circular and linear views.

The linear view expands details on chromosome 1 with tracks similar to the circular layout, supplemented with additional tracks. The ideogram is followed by 'Putative Driver' gene annotations, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation', and VCF file visualizations showing mutations and variations. Notably, individual points and rectangles are colored based on their respective categories and subtypes, such as point mutations labeled by 'C>A' or 'T>G'. Additional tracks in the linear view provide detailed insights into insertions, deletions, and copy number variants, all shown with distinct color coding and annotations.
