A linear arc diagram, titled "Visual Encoding" with the subtitle "Arcs," displays connections within chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The arches are drawn from two genomic intervals defined by fields "s1" and "e1" to "s2" and "e2," using a CSV dataset sourced from an external URL. The connections are colored nominally based on the "s1" field, with colors including blue, orange, green, and others. The arcs are overlaid on a background spanning genomic positions 103,900,000 to 104,100,000. This visualization uses a semi-transparent effect with black-stroke outlines for visual emphasis.
