The linear visualization features three genomic range annotation tracks, titled 'HiGlass,' 'IGV,' and 'Corces et al.,' displaying data for chromosome 3 from positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. 

- **HiGlass Track:** Displays gene names with directional arrows, exons as rectangles, and rules with triangle patterns indicating strand direction. Colors differentiate between positive (blue) and negative (orange) strands.
  
- **IGV Track:** Highlights genes with green text and rectangles. White patterned lines indicate strand direction, enhancing visibility against a green background.

- **Corces et al. Track:** Represents gene orientation and exons similarly to the HiGlass track, with all elements proportionally smaller. Text annotations are in blue and orange based on strand orientation.

The tracks are aligned vertically to facilitate the comparison of gene annotations across different databases, using consistent chromosomal intervals and a clear visual distinction of strand orientations via color and shape patterns.
