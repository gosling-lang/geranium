A circular and linear genomic visualization in a vertical arrangement showcases various chromosomal features of hg19. The circular plot, centered on the genome, features five tracks including an ideogram, point annotations, and a range of annotations titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' displayed in sky blue and dark orange, respectively. Connections are depicted as lines between genomic positions, categorized by structural variants such as 'Duplication' and 'Deletion.'

In the linear view, the region linked from chromosome 1 in the circular view is expanded. It includes ideogram tracks, gene annotations, and a scatter plot labeled 'Point Mutation,' where points express distances between mutations with colors indicating variant types like 'C>A,' 'C>G,' etc. Additional annotation tracks depict 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' with rectangles in yellow and green, while 'Copy Number Variants' are represented via gray bars reflecting total copy numbers.
