A multi-layer genomics visualization in a linear layout represents data from chromosome 1 between base pairs 1 and 3,000,500. The top track displays an area chart stratified by samples, using different colors for 'sample 1' through 'sample 4'. The area represents quantitative 'peak' values. The bottom track is a bar chart, also stratified by the same samples. Bars are colored to indicate different samples, and their lengths represent variations between 'peak_min' and 'peak_max' values. Each track provides interactive tooltips detailing genomic positions and values.
