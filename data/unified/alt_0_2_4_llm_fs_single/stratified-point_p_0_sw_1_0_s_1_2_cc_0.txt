A multi-row scatter plot in a linear vertical layout visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. Each row represents a different sample, named 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The position on the x-axis is based on genomic data, while the y-axis and size of points encode quantitative data from the 'peak' field. The points are colored according to their respective samples: blue, orange, green, and red. The plot includes tooltips providing additional information about start and end positions, peak values, and sample categories, with points displayed at 50% opacity for clarity.
