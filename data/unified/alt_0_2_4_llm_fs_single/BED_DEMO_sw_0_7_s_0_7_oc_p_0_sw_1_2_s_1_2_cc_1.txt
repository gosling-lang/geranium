A linear layout presents four tracks each displaying BED file data on chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 2,000,000. The first track shows "BED12: All 12 standard fields" in pink, representing standard BED fields. The second track, "BED6," illustrates basic BED fields in the same color. The third track, "BED6+6," includes additional custom fields marked in sky blue. The final track, "BED12+1," shows standard fields with an extra field highlighted in purple. Each track visualizes genomic intervals using rectangles, emphasizing the use of different BED file specifications.
