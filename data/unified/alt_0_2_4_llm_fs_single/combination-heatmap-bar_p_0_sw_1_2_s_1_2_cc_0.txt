A visualization in a linear layout displays genomic data for chromosome 1, with the interval spanning from 1 to 3,000,500. The top track is a heat map using a multivec data file, where genomic positions are represented on the x-axis, and the intensity of color encodes expression values. This track is stratified by rows for the categories: 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' The bottom track is a bar chart, also stratified by samples, depicting expression values on the y-axis. The bars are colored using nominal values with a range of distinct colors, including blue, orange, green, and red, corresponding to each sample. Both tracks include tooltips providing additional information on the genomic position and expression values.
