A circular bar chart visualizes genomic data from chromosome 1 within a range of bases from 1 to 3,000,500. The chart has a circular layout with vertical arrangement and a centered radius of 0.5. It shows two samples, 'sample 1' and 'sample 2,' using multivec data. Bars represent min and max peak values on the y-axis, with each bar's color indicating its corresponding sample. Categories are denoted by bar color and the chart is stratified by rows. The color palette includes shades of blue and orange. The chart's design includes black strokes around bars to enhance visibility, and a tooltip provides additional genomic position and peak value information. The data is static, focusing on the detailed visualization of the specified genomic region.
