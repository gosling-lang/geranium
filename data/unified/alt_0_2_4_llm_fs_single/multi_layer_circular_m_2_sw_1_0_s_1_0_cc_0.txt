A circular area chart visualizes a multivec file featuring the chromosome 12 interval from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. This visualization includes multiple tracks, each representing a different sample encoded in distinct colors, such as blue, orange, and green. The chart is organized in concentric rings for each sample, displaying quantitative peaks in corresponding colors. The genomic coordinates are mapped along the circular layout, with opacity levels adjusted to highlight different peak ranges. This design emphasizes the graphical perception of multiple time series as described by Javed et al. in TVCG 2010.
