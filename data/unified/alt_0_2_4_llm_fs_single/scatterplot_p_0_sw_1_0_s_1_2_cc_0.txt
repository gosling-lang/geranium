A scatter plot in a vertical linear layout visualizes the multivec file, representing the chromosome 1 region from base pair 1 to 3,000,500. The positions of data points on the x-axis are based on genomic coordinates, while the y-axis, size, and grid features encode quantitative 'peak' values. The points are colored by categories: 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4,' using a palette that includes blue, orange, green, and red. Transparency of points is set to 50% opacity. Interactive tooltips provide additional details for each data point, such as start and end genomic positions and peak values.
