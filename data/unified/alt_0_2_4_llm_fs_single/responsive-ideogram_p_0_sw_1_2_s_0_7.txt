The visualization is a detailed ideogram of chromosome 7, using the human genome assembly hg38 as the reference. The x-axis represents the genomic positions on chromosome 7, visualized from position 1 to 159,345,973. The ideogram uses a variety of visual encodings to represent the bands, including different shades of gray and black for regions with varying staining intensities. Stain types such as "gneg," "gpos25," "gpos50," "gpos75," "gpos100," and "gvar" are represented with respective colors. "Acen," indicating centromeric regions, is shown in maroon using triangular shapes to suggest direction and position. Text annotations indicate major bands and points of interest, colored based on staining categories. The visualization is dynamically adjustable, with responsive features that allow seamless scaling of width and height based on the display area.
