The visualization is a multi-row bar chart in a linear layout, displaying genomic data for chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. Each row represents a distinct sample category: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', with respective colors, including shades of orange, green, blue, and magenta. The x-axis represents genomic position, while the y-axis encodes quantitative 'peak' values. The tooltip provides additional data, showing start and end positions, peak values, and sample details. The data is sourced from a multivec file with a specific URL.
