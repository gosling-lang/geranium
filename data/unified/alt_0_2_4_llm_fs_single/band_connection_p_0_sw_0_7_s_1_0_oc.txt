A linear visualization displays genomic segments and connections on chromosome 1 between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. The layout comprises seven tracks, including four featuring green rectangles representing genomic intervals and three with green links between these intervals, indicating genomic connections. All elements are colored in green shades with low opacity, enhancing visualization clarity. The source data is provided in CSV format and includes fields for start and end genomic positions. The visualization has a width of 350 units, emphasizing a compact representation.
