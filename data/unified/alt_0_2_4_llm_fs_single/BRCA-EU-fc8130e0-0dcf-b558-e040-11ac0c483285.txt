A visualization featuring a circular and a linear view, both linked by an interactive brush in blue. The circular view displays the entire genome with tracks including an ideogram, text annotation titled 'Putative Driver', and range annotations for 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' in sky blue and dark orange rectangles, respectively. Connections between genomic positions are shown in lines of different colors indicating various structural variations such as 'Translocation', 'Duplication', 'Deletion', and 'Inversion'. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, featuring an ideogram with colored bands, and tracks for genomic annotations such as 'Copy Number Variants' showing gray rectangles. A scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' visualizes data points with varying positions along the y-axis, representing mutation distances and subtypes marked by color. Additional range and connection tracks reflect structural variations with annotations in colors matching the circular diagram.
