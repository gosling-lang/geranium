The visualization consists of two linear tracks, each measuring 1152 pixels in width and displaying genomic data from chromosome 2. The top track is a line chart that represents expression values across genomic positions, with data from samples 1, 3, and 4. Each line is color-codedâ€”blue for sample 1, orange for sample 3, and green for sample 4. The stroke outlining each line is white, with a width of 0.5 pixels.

The bottom track is an area chart displaying data from samples 1 and 2, using the same genomic positions. The areas are also color-coded, with blue representing sample 1 and orange for sample 2. The area displays share the same white stroke properties as the line chart for consistency.

Both tracks are stratified by sample categories, with colors providing clear differentiation in a nominal scale. The data source for both charts is a multivec file accessed from resgen.io via a specified URL. The charts utilize a shared x-axis linked by the identifier 'link1,' ensuring alignment and comparability across genomic coordinates. The visual representation is intended to facilitate an understanding of quantitative variation in peak expression values across different genomic samples.
