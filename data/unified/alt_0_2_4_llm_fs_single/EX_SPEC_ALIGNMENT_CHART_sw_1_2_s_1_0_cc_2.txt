A genomic alignment visualization using a linear layout features alignment, gap, and conservation metrics across specified intervals. The first track is a bar chart titled "Gap," with the x-axis showing genomic positions and the y-axis representing gap sizes. The bars are colored pink. The next track displays conservation levels, using a heatmap style for intensity, on another bar chart. Below these, a sequence alignment is shown using colored rectangles and text, stratified by sequence names on the y-axis. An additional overlay combines multiple tracks: rectangles for sequence position, two bar charts for gap and conservation data, with interactive brushing between 350-396 genomic positions.
