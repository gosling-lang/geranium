A circular visualization features two interconnected tracks. The left track is a "withinLink" chart, presenting segments of chromosome 1 between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. Links are drawn with varying colors, denoting distinct categories from the data field 's1.' The right track is an "area" chart, showing genomic positions from a multivec file across four samples. The x-axis represents the genome, while the y-axis indicates 'peak' values. Areas are color-coded by sample, with a legend on display. This setup visualizes data from a CSV and multivec source, providing comparative genomic insights.
