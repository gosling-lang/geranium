The visualization, titled "Breast Cancer Variant (Staaf et al. 2019)," showcases genomic characteristics of RAD51C- and PALB2-altered triple-negative breast cancers. It consists of an interactive circular ideogram depicting structural variants, gains, and losses of heterozygosity across the genome. This view is linked to a detailed linear view of chromosome 1. Various tracks highlight specific genomic features, including a separate gene annotation track. The ideogram uses coloration to indicate different band types, with text annotations identifying putative driver genes and structural variants classified by type. The feature-rich circular view provides an overview, while linked linear tracks allow for a more detailed exploration of specific regions. Additionally, focused coverage and pileup tracks visualize sequence alignment using BAM files, offering insights into genomic alterations at a finer scale.
