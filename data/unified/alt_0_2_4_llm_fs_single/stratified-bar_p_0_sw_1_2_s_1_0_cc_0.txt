A multi-row bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 1 from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The chart includes four rows, each representing 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', respectively. The expression levels are represented by the height of the bars plotted on the y-axis. Each row has its color: blue, orange, green, and red, corresponding to the respective samples. The bars are stratified by categories and are interactive, providing detailed genomic and peak value information via tooltips. The visualization is configured with a vertical arrangement and features a legend indicating category colors.
