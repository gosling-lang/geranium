A circular scatter plot with a vertical arrangement visualizes a multivec file, displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from position 1 to 3,000,500. The chart is divided into four concentric rows, representing 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each row uses point marks with colors blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The position and size of the points encode quantitative data from the 'peak' field, and the opacity is set to 0.5. The visualization is static, with a center radius of 0.5, and includes tooltips providing genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample names.
