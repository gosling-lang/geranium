A vertical linear layout visualization shows genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500 using a multivec file. The top track is a scatter plot highlighting expression values with points along the y-axis. Points are color-coded based on categories, namely 'sample 1' through 'sample 4.' The bottom track features both a scatter plot and a line chart. Expression values in this track are depicted with points and lines, stratified into rows representing different categories. The size of points corresponds to their expression values, enhancing data comprehension. Both tracks include interactive tooltips providing genomic positions, value, and sample information.
