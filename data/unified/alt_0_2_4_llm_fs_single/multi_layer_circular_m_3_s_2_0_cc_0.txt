A multi-layer circular bar chart visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart consists of six concentric rows, each representing a different sample category: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 6', 'sample 7', and 'sample 8'. Each row is color-coded, with blue, orange, green, red, purple, and brown representing different categories. The bar heights display quantitative data from the 'peak' field. The layout provides a clear genomic overview, effectively illustrating data patterns across categories.
