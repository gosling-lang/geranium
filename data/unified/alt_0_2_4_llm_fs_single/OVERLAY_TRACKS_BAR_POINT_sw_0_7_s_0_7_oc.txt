The linear chart titled "Example: Overlay Tracks" visualizes ClinVar data on chromosome 3 using overlaying bars and points. Genomic intervals are displayed along the x-axis, while the y-axis categorizes the significance of variants as 'Pathogenic,' 'Likely Pathogenic,' 'Uncertain Significance,' 'Likely Benign,' or 'Benign.' Points and bars are colored by category, with pathogenic variants in orange and benign ones in green. This visualization uses a BED database and employs both bar and point markers to represent significance, with baseline alignment at 'Uncertain Significance.' The chart integrates interactive features like brushing and linking for navigational ease.
