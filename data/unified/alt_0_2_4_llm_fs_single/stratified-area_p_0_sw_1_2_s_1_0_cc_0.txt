The visualization is an area plot arranged in a linear layout, focused on chromosome 1, spanning from base 1 to 3,000,500. It uses a multivec data file to represent genomic positions and peak values. The data is stratified into four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4', which are displayed in distinct colorsâ€”blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. Each category occupies a separate row, visualizing peak values on the y-axis against genomic positions on the x-axis. The plot includes tooltips for genomic start and end positions, peak values, and sample names, enhancing the interactive experience. The chart's visual style involves white strokes defining the area plots with a stroke width of 0.5.
