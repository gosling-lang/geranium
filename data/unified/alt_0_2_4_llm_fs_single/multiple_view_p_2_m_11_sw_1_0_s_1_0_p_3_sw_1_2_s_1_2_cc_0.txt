The visualization titled "Visual Linking" features an interactive multi-view genomic data representation. The main view is a vertical linear scatter plot showing chromosome 1 between positions 160,000,000 and 200,000,000, with points representing expression values colored by categories: blue, orange, green, and red. Below, a horizontal arrangement includes a circular overview and a linear area chart. The circular chart depicts the entire chromosome 1 with line representations and a brush linking to the main scatter plot. The linear area chart shows expression ranges across four samples, with areas colored correspondingly to the scatter plot categories. Interaction is enabled via brushes to update views dynamically. The visualization effectively combines scatter, line, and area marks to facilitate genomic analysis.
