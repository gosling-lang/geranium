This visualization presents two line charts in a linear layout, illustrating genomic data focused on chromosome 1 (hg38 assembly). The top chart represents the entire chromosome 1, with expression levels shown on the y-axis. Lines are colored in purple, and an interactive steel blue brush links to the bottom chart. The bottom chart zooms into a specific region, between positions 200,000,000 and 220,000,000, with lines colored sky blue. This dynamic interaction, titled "Example: Brushing and Linking," helps in detailed analysis of genomic variations across specified intervals.
