The visualization is a circular layout featuring two tracks. The left track displays a heat map with color intensity encoding expression values, stratified by sample categories across the genome of chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The right track presents a circular bar chart where the genome is shown on the x-axis and expression values are displayed as bars on the y-axis. Each bar's color corresponds to different samples, revealing insights into the data through visual stratification. The entire design is encompassed in a static framework, emphasizing visual clarity and comprehensive genome-wide analysis.
