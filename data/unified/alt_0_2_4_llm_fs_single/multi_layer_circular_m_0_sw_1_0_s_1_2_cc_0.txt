A circular multi-layer scatter plot visualizes genomic data from chromosome 12, spanning 5,000,000 to 15,000,000 base pairs. This visualization is built using a multivec file that includes 16 categories ranging from 'sample 1' through 'sample 16.' Each layer represents different intervals of the quantitative 'peak' value. Points are colored based on their category, featuring a variety of hues like blue, orange, and green. The plot shows five overlaid tracks, each with varying opacity to encode different ranges of peak expression. The outermost track indicates peaks without gridlines, transitioning inward to tracks that display gridlines for better quantitative comparison. This visualization reflects data transformation techniques to filter out unspecified 'sample -' entries.
