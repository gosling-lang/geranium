The visualization is an overlaid Hi-C matrix displaying genomic data with multiple annotations, spanning an interval from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 on the x-axis. The main matrix shows genomic interactions for chromosomes 5 through 10, with grey color intensity indicating expression values. Overlaid elements include red vertical lines and blue horizontal lines demarcating specific genomic positions. Additional matrix annotations depict further genomic interactions using color-coded categories and quantitative expression values. This comprehensive visualization integrates bar marks, vertical and horizontal rules, and point charts within a single unified linear layout.
