A circular visualization displays genomic data on chromosome 1. The outer track features a circular scatter plot, encoding expression levels with points on a y-axis and representing categories with distinct colors. The inner track is a circular ideogram, showing chromosome intervals with bars. The dataset employs a multivec format for the scatter plot and CSV for the ideogram, linked through a shared genomic domain. The visualization uses the hg38 assembly, with specific styles for stroke and color mapping in the ideogram to depict various stain categories.
