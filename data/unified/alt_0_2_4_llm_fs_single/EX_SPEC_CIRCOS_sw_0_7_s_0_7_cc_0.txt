A circular visualization demonstrating genomic connections among various chromosomes using a Circos layout. The chart encompasses three primary tracks: a purple bar chart representing genomic positions, a colored ideogram indicating chromosome bands, and connection lines displaying segmental duplications between chromosomal locations. Each connection is color-coded to denote different chromosomes, emphasizing their interactions. The chart aligns circularly with a specified center radius, offering a comprehensive view of genomic data.
