The visualization displays a multi-row bar chart in a linear arrangement, highlighting genomic data across chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. Each row represents one of four samples, with colors—yellow, green, blue, and pink—indicating the samples 'sample 1' to 'sample 4' respectively. Bars plot the minimum and maximum expression values indicated by the 'peak_min' and 'peak_max' fields. Black strokes with a width of 0.2 outline the bars, while a tooltip provides genomic position, minimum, and maximum expression values for each bar. The chart is stratified by these categories, with rows showing these in the colors of the bars.
