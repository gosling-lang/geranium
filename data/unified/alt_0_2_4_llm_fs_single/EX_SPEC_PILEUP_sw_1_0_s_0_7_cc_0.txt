The linear visualization features two main tracks displaying BAM data for chromosome 1 from positions 136,750 to 139,450. The upper track is a bar chart titled "example_higlass.bam," which represents the coverage of genomic regions with bars colored in silver. The bars' height indicates the number of aligned reads within those regions.

The lower track, also titled "example_higlass.bam," presents a pileup view, showing individual genomic reads as rectangles. Each rectangle's color signifies a particular type of structural variation or alignment issue, such as 'normal read,' 'deletion (+-),' 'inversion (++),' 'inversion (--),' 'duplication (-+),' 'more than two mates,' 'mates not found within chromosome,' and 'clipping.' This information is described in the legend, with colors like gray, orange, green, and red, among others. The visualization employs an interactive tooltip for more detailed data exploration and includes specific styling such as right-aligned axes and a legend title indicating an insert size of 300bp.
