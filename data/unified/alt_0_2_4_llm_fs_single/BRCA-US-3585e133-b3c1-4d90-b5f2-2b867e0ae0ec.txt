The visualization consists of a circular and linear view connected via an interactive brush. The circular view displays the entire human genome, laid out in a circular ideogram with various tracks. Notable tracks include a text annotation titled "Putative Driver" and range annotations titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)," visualized with rectangles colored in sky blue and dark orange, respectively. A connection track shows genomic links, with line colors indicating structural variations such as Translocation and Deletion.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, presented across multiple tracks. Annotation tracks marking "Point Mutation" display a scatter plot where each data point signifies mutation distance. A "Copy Number Variants" track uses bars to represent quantitative data. Additional tracks illustrate insertions and deletions, while connection tracks visually explain structural variations. The elements are colored and styled according to their data categories, enhancing data clarity and distinction.
