The visualization is a linear bar chart displaying genomic data across various chromosomes, titled "Basic Marks: bar" with a subtitle of "Tutorial Examples." The x-axis represents genomic positions, segmented by chromosome identifiers such as chr1, chr2, etc., while the y-axis quantifies the expression levels, denoted by the height of the orange bars. The data originates from a multivec tile, categorized under "sample 1," with a bin size of 5. The chart provides a clear depiction of genomic intervals and their corresponding expression values, facilitating insights into the distribution and magnitude of genomic features along the hg38 assembly.
