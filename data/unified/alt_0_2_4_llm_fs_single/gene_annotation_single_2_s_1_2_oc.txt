The visualization is a linear genomic range annotation chart titled "IGV" displaying data from chromosome 3 within the interval of 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. It employs a vertical arrangement of views, with tracks overlaid to depict gene structures. Gene names are shown as text annotations in navy color, while rectangles representing gene regions are also colored navy. The display is stratified by strands, with '+' and '-' strands indicated by white triangle patterns within the rectangles. The chart uses a genomic layout with the x-axis representing the genomic positions.
