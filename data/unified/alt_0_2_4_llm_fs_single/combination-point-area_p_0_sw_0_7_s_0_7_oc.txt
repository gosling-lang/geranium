A composite visualization in a vertical linear layout consists of two tracks displaying genomic data of chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The top track features a scatter plot where each point represents a 'peak' value, with size and position determined by quantitative expression data. The points are color-coded to represent four categories: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. The bottom track is an area chart stratified by the same categories. It displays genomic data as filled areas, with each color corresponding to a different sample. The charts allow interaction through tooltips that detail 'Start Position', 'End Position', 'Value', and 'Sample' information.
