The visualization is a circular chart showcasing genomic data from chromosome 1, within the interval of 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs of the hg38 assembly. Featuring a within-link mark, it displays genomic connections using distinct colors based on the categories of the data field named 's1'. The layout is vertical with a central radius of 0.5, and the view is static. The stroke of each connection is black with an opacity of 0.2. The chart encapsulates a section range from 103,900,000 to 104,100,000 base pairs in a visually condensed form, creating an intriguing, interconnected genomic presentation.
