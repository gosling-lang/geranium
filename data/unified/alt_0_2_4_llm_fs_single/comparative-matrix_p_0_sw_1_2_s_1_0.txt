The visualization displays two overlaid matrix tracks, both representing genomic data for chromosome 10. The matrices are arranged in a diagonal orientation within a square, showcasing genomic positions on both x and y axes as intervals. The expression values are encoded by color intensity. The lower-left matrix displays in shades of grey, while the upper-right matrix is in shades of pink. Both matrices use quantitative color legends to denote intensity of expression values. The visualization is designed for responsiveness with dynamic resizing capability according to the width. The linking ID ensures coordination between the tracks for consistent genomic representations.
