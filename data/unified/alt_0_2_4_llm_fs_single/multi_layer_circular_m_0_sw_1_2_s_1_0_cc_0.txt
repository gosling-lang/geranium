The visualization is a circular scatter plot showing genomic data from chromosome 12, within the interval of 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. It comprises points stratified into 16 categories labeled as 'sample 1' through 'sample 16', omitting 'sample -'. Each category is represented by a distinct color, forming concentric circles. The expression levels are shown on the radial axis, using multiple tracks with varying opacity to represent different ranges of peak values. The data is encoded from a multivec file and filtered for specific samples, with the visualization allowing for comparative analysis of the genomic intervals and peak values. The reference for this visualization is "Graphical perception of Multiple Time Series" by Javed et al., TVCG 2010.
