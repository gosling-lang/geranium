The visualization consists of a vertical arrangement with a circular and linear view. The circular view is static and features two tracks: a bar chart and a chart with genomic connections. The bar chart displays genomic intervals with expression values stratified by sample categories, using distinct colors. Brushes link to linear bar charts for detailed views. The genomic connections chart highlights different types of connections in chromosomes 1, 16, 14, 9, 6, 5, and 3, with colored strokes indicating categories like deletion, inversion, translocation, and tandem duplication.

The linear view is split horizontally, containing two bar charts that zoom into details of chromosomes 5 and 16, guided by the circular view's brushes. These charts also display genomic intervals with expression data, categorized by samples and color-coded for clarity. The visualization collectively provides a comprehensive view of genomic data with interactive features allowing for detailed exploration of specific regions.
