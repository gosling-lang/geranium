The visualization is a circular chart with within-link connections, focusing on chromosome 1 between genomic positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. It uses data from a CSV file and displays segments with connections in varying colors, indicating different categories identified by the field 's1.' The structure is arranged vertically and employs a nominal color encoding with a range of ten distinct colors. The layout features a central radius of 0.5, and the connections are styled with a black stroke and an opacity level of 0.2, creating an intersecting pattern of overlapping arcs. This composition is static, with no interactivity, and is implemented in the circular layout format using the hg38 assembly.
