The visualization features a circular layout with two main tracks representing genomic data. The left track is a circular bar chart displaying expression levels as bars across genomic positions on chromosome 1, with categories differentiated by color. This track uses multivec data with samples labeled 'sample 1' through 'sample 4.'

The right track presents an overlay of a circular line chart and a scatter plot. The line chart shows continuous expression data with lines and the scatter plot highlights individual data points, whose sizes correspond to expression values. Both tracks visually stratify data by sample, encoding categories via color.

Tooltips provide detailed information about genomic position, expression values, and sample categories when interacting with the plot. This visualization helps analyze expression profiles across a specific genomic interval, offering an intuitive way to compare datasets.

Overall, this circular visualization adeptly combines multivariate data into an integrated, interactive format, facilitating deep genomic insights.
