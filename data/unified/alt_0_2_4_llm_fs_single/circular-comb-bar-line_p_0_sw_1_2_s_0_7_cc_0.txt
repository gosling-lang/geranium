A circular visualization displays genomic data from chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. It includes two main tracks arranged vertically. The left track features a circular bar chart, where the genomic positions are mapped on the x-axis, and peak expression values are shown on the y-axis with bars. Each bar's color represents different samples ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'), utilizing a distinct color palette. The right track comprises an overlay of a circular line chart and scatter plot, displaying genomic positions on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis using lines and points. The point sizes further encode expression values. Both tracks include interactive tooltips providing detailed information about genomic positions and peak values for each sample. The visualization is designed for static viewing without direct manipulation possibilities.
