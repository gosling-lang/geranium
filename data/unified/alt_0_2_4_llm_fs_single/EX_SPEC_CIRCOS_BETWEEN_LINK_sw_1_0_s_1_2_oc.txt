The visualization is a circular layout with the title "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements." It comprises a circular bar chart, two ideograms, and a chart with connections in a stacking alignment. The genome is represented on the x-axis with intervals, and expression values are shown using light gray bars on the y-axis. The ideograms display different categories with varying rectangle colors based on genomic data from the UCSC HG38 Human CytoBand Ideogram. Connections between genomic regions are indicated with curved lines, where black lines represent connections within chromosome hs1 and light gray for others. The visualization leverages multivec and CSV data sources to represent genomic fields such as chromosome, start, and end positions on HG38 assembly. The layout emphasizes the genomic architecture and connections in human chromosomes.
