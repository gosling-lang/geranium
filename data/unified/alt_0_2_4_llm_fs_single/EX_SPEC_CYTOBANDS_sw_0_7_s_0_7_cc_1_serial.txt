This visualization is a linear layout consisting of five views arranged serially, each representing a different chromosome (chr1 to chr5) of the genome hg38. It combines area charts and ideograms to visualize multivec data. 

Each view contains an area chart that uses color to differentiate four category samples and displays expression values on the y-axis over genomic positions on the x-axis. The area charts have distinct color ranges: blue, orange, green, and red. Below the area charts, ideograms illustrate the cytogenetic bands, with colors indicating different densities: white to black, representing increasing density, and specific patterns like acen (red triangles) and gvar (blue). The tracks generate a comprehensive representation of genomic data, conveying both quantitative and categorical information.
