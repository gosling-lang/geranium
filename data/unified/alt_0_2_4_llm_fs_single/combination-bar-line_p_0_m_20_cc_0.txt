A linear visualization displays genomic data from chromosome 1 within the range of 1 to 3,000,500. It consists of two tracks: the top track is a scatter plot with points representing 'peak' values against genomic positions, colored differently based on categories 'sample 1' to 'sample 4.' The bottom track features an overlay of bar and line charts, stratified by rows for the same categories, also using distinct colors. The bar and line heights encode the 'peak' values, adding a quantitative dimension to the visualization. The color legend ensures easy category identification.
