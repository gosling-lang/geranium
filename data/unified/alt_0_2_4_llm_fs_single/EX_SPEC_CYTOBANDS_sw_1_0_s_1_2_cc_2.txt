The visualization consists of a series of parallel linear tracks, each representing a different chromosome from chr1 to chr5. Each track contains two main components: an area chart and an ideogram overlay. The area chart displays genomic data from a multivec file with peaks representing quantitative values shown on the y-axis and positioned across the genome on the x-axis. Different samples are categorized by color, including blue, orange, green, and red. Underneath, the ideogram represents cytogenetic bands along each chromosome with text annotations indicating band names. Bands are depicted using various shades, and specific categories are marked with color-coded triangles for centromere regions, providing visual cues about chromosomal structures and density. The visualization is arranged in a static, parallel layout, facilitating comparison across chromosomes.
