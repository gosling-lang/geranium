A multi-type genomic visualization combines circular and linear views linked by an interactive brush. The circular view encompasses the entire genome with tracks such as an ideogram, annotated text for putative driver genes, blue rectangles indicating 'Gain,' and orange rectangles for 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH).' A connection track shows structural variations categorized into ‘Gain,’ ‘LOH,’ ‘Translocation,’ ‘Duplication,’ ‘Deletion,’ and ‘Inversion’ using line colors and styles.

The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, mirroring some circular view tracks and adding detailed annotations like a gene track, a scatter plot of point mutations, and structured tracks for insertions and deletions in different colors. Moreover, this view includes range annotations for copy number variants visualizing total copy numbers with gray rectangles. The visual arrangement allows an interactive exploration of genomic data.
