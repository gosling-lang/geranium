A linear multi-row chart visualizes a multivec file showing chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. Four samples are displayed, each represented in separate rows with distinct colors, including orange, green, blue, and purple. The plot combines a line chart and scatter plot, where positions are shown on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis. The size of the points represents the magnitude of the peak value. A legend indicating the sample categories is included.
