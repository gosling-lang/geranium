The visualization presents a genomic analysis with a circular layout and two linear bar charts. The circular chart showcases four samples arranged from outer to inner layers, each colored differently (blue, orange, green, red). Bars denote quantitative data across genomic positions. Colored connection lines within the circular chart indicate chromosomal rearrangements, categorized by stroke style such as deletion, inversion, translocation, and tandem duplication.

Below, two detailed linear bar charts are linked by interactive brushes in the circular view. The first linear chart focuses on chromosome 5, while the second highlights chromosome 16. Both charts depict quantitative data across genomic regions, with sample categories displayed in the same color scheme as the circular chart, facilitating comparative analysis across genomic positions.
