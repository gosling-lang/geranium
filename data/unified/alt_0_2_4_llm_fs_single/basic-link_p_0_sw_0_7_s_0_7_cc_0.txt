The visualization titled "Basic Marks: Link" features a linear layout displaying connections within genomic regions on chromosome 1, as specified in a CSV file. Each connection is represented by arcs linking two genomic positions, with start and end points on the x-axis for intervals, and additional start and end positions for the linked regions. The arcs are colored in light red, set against a horizontal genomic axis. The subtitle "Tutorial Examples" accompanies the title. The visualization illustrates structural variations or duplications within the chromosome, highlighting interactions between the specified regions.
