The visualization titled "Visual Linking" consists of a vertically arranged interactive layout featuring genomic data represented across different views. The first view is a linear scatter plot of chromosome 1 between intervals 160,000,000 and 200,000,000, stratified into four categorical rows: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each is illustrated by points in unique colors like blue, orange, green, and red, signifying distinct samples based on the 'peak' value on the y-axis.

Below, a horizontal alignment of two distinct plots—the first being a circular line chart, the second a linear area chart—depicts the genomic data across chromosome 1. The circular line chart visually encodes the chromosomes with colored lines for each sample category, integrating an interactive brush for exploration. Similarly, the linear area chart showcases genomic regions as colored areas, with the interactive brush dynamically linking to other views, enriching the detail view synchronization. The flexible interactive setup allows users to alter the position and range of brushes, updating the detail visualization accordingly in the bottom linear section.
