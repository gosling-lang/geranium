The visualization is a circular bar chart in a vertical arrangement showcasing genomic data from chromosome 1 within the interval 1 to 3,000,500. The chart displays expression values with bars on the y and ye-axes, allowing for quantitative comparison. Each bar is colored according to the sample category, with two categories, 'sample 1' and 'sample 2,' visually distinguished by color. The tracks are organized in rows based on the 'sample' field, with a legend provided. Tooltips offer additional details about the genomic position and expression values, with labels indicating minimum and maximum values. The chart is static, with overall dimensions of 420x420, and styled with thin black strokes around the bars for emphasis.
