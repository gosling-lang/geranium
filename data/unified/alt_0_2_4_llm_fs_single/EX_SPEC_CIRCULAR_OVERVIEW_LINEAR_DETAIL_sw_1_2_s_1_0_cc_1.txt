A visualization consists of a circular chart and two horizontal bar charts, formatted in a vertical arrangement. The circular chart features two tracks: a stratified bar chart displaying genomic intervals and peaks, and a connection line chart illustrating rearrangements with strokes colored according to types such as deletion and inversion. The bar chart shows data in a multivec file across samples with brush tools linking to the horizontal charts.

The horizontal section has two bar charts showcasing chromosome 5 and 16. Each bar's y-axis represents the peak value, with colors assigned to different samples, linked by a brush to specific genomic regions in the circular view.

The dataset, in hg38 assembly, highlights genomic information comprehensively through multivec and CSV files, effectively utilizing color and connection strokes to depict categorical variations.
