A scatter plot in a linear layout visualizes point mutations from a VCF file using chromosome coordinates on the x-axis, filtered to exclude unknown values for log-transformed distances to previous mutations. Each point represents a mutation type, color-coded as one of six categories, such as 'C>A', 'C>G', 'C>T', 'T>A', 'T>C', and 'T>G,' with colors like orange, green, blue, pink, and so on. The plot measures 294x121 pixels, showing genomic positions and quantitative data in the vertical arrangement described by the subtitle "Point mutations from a VCF file."
