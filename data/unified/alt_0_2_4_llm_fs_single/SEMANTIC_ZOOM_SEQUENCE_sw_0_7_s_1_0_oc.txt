The visualization is a linear layout bar chart demonstrating genomic data with semantic zooming capabilities. When zooming in, text marks indicating base pairs (A, T, G, and C) become visible on the chart. The x-axis represents the genome at various positions, while the y-axis shows aggregate counts. Bars are color-coded to represent different nucleotide categories: adenine (orange), thymine (blue), guanine (green), and cytosine (purple). The accompanying text appears in white upon zooming in, offering a detailed look at base pairs. This dynamic view allows interactive exploration of genomic sequences, with a bold text styling emphasizing the base pair labels. The chart is titled "Example: Semantic Zooming" and aims to illustrate the transition from aggregate data to individual base pair visibility.
