The visualization comprises a vertical arrangement with two main sections. The upper section features a circular layout containing two tracks. The first track is a bar chart showing genomic intervals across different chromosome samples, visualized as color-coded bars. The four categories—'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'—are represented in blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. The second track displays genomic connections between chromosomes 1, 16, 14, 9, 6, 5, and 3, using purple strokes to indicate different connection types like deletion, inversion, translocation, and tandem-duplication. Below, there are two horizontal bar charts, each displaying a detailed view of chromosomes 5 and 16. The background of each bar chart reflects the brushing interaction from the circular view, with background colors of blue and red, linking the detailed views to specific chromosomes. The layout effectively demonstrates genomic data interactions and variations in a clear, color-coded manner.
