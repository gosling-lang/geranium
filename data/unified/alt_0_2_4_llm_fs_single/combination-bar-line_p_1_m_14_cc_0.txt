The visualization displays a genomic data analysis focusing on chromosome 1, spanning the interval from 1 to 3,000,500 base pairs. It features a linear arrangement of two main views. The upper view uses an overlay alignment to show area and point marks, stratified by samples. Each sample ('sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4') is represented with a distinct color: blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. This view highlights the genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis, with additional size encoding for peak values. An adjacent scatter plot below visualizes point marks using identical sample categories and colors. The x-axis continues to exhibit genomic positions, while the y-axis quantifies peak expression. Visual elements such as legends and tooltips enhance interpretability, providing details on position, peak value, and sample categorization. The entire visualization applies a center radius of 0.8, ensuring a cohesive layout across tracks.
