The visualization titled "Hi-C Matrix" presents genomic data in an overlaid matrix format. It displays the Hi-C interaction data across multiple chromosomes, from 800,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 in genomic intervals. The primary matrix fills a 600x600 layout, where genomic positions are represented on both x and y axes, with intensity of color encoding interaction values. Annotations include vertical green and horizontal purple lines marking specific chromosome positions. Additional tracks feature bar and point charts, displaying categories and annotations with varying color and opacity using a hot color scheme. Points are layered with sizes indicating expression levels, colored in pink and outlined in white, providing detailed insights into genomic interaction structures. The subtitle explains the visualization's focus on the matrix data combined with annotations for enhanced interpretability.
