The visualization represents a linear genomic range annotation over chromosome 3, from positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. It is designed in a horizontal arrangement with genomic features, including genes and exons, displayed in two rows corresponding to the positive and negative DNA strands. Gene annotations are shown using triangles and lines, with right-facing blue triangles for the positive strand and left-facing red triangles for the negative strand. Exons are depicted as rectangles. The name of each gene is positioned above or below these symbols. The chart is titled 'HiGlass' and the two strands are differentiated by color: blue for the positive strand and red for the negative strand. The opacity of the elements is set to 0.8, and the layout accommodates data for gene visualization smoothly across the specified genomic interval.
