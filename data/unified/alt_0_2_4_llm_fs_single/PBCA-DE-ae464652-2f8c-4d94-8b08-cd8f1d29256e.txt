A visualization featuring both circular and linear views of genomic data for the hg19 assembly. The circular view includes a genome-wide ideogram with a linking brush, a "Putative Driver" text annotation track, and two range annotation tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)", displaying genomic ranges in blue and orange rectangles respectively. A connections track visualizes structural variations with lines of varying colors, representing categories like 'Translocation' and 'Duplication'. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, featuring a detailed ideogram and annotation tracks. It includes a scatter plot titled "Point Mutation", highlighting point mutations in the VCF file, and tracks for "Copy Number Variants", "Insertion", and "Deletion", with color-coded rectangles.
