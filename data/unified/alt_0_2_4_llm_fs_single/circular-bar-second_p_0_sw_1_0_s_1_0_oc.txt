The circular bar chart visualizes genomic data from chromosome 1 within the interval 1 to 3,000,500 in a vertical arrangement. The layout centers at a radius of 0.5, with stratified rows representing different samples, namely 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each row is colored distinctly, and the data values, encoded as bar heights, represent expression levels. The chart includes a legend showing color assignments for each sample. The genomic position is on the top axis, and the data is sourced from a multivec file. The visualization links values with a tooltip detailing start and end positions, expression values, and associated samples. Static settings ensure a consistent view of this genomic range.
