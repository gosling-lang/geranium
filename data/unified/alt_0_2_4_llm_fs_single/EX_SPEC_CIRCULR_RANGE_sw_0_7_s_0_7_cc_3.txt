The visualization is a circular bar chart displaying genomic data. It is arranged in a circular layout with a center radius of 0.3. This chart illustrates data from a vector source, focused on genomic positions marked on the x-axis and corresponding peak values on the y-axis. The data visualized is from the hg38 assembly. Each bar represents the quantitative peak values for genomic positions, colored in green. The bar marks and their heights indicate the intensity of the peak values at various genomic positions. The layout is static and uses a spacing of 1, with bars aligned in a stacked manner around the circle.
