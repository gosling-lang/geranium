This visualization features two horizontal circular scatter plots, both visualizing genomic data from a multivec dataset on chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The left plot displays expression values encoded by the size and position of points. The color of points represents four different samples, with blue, orange, green, and red hues. The right plot also shows expression values, stratified by rows according to sample categories. This plot highlights the distribution of categorical data across genomic coordinates, with color distinguishing each sample. The plots are in a static layout, enhancing focused genomic analysis.
