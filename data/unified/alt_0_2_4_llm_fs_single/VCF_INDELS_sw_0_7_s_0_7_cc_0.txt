The visualization is a linear chart depicting insertions and deletions from a VCF file across various chromosomes, including chr1, chr3, chr5, chr7, chr9, chr12, chr15, and chrX. The chart uses rectangular marks colored distinctly for insertions (orange) and deletions (green), with genomic positions mapped along the x-axis. Rows categorize the mutations, and the chart's background is light gray. The opacity of the rectangles is set to 0.9, enhancing visibility. Tooltips provide genomic details and mutation specifics when interacting with the visualization.
