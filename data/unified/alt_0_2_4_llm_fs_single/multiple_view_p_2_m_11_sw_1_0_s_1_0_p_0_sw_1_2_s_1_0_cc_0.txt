The visualization titled "Visual Linking" consists of multiple views arranged vertically to demonstrate genomic data linkage and exploration. The top section features two interactive charts: a linear chart with an area plot and a circular line chart, both showing the entire chromosome 1. These charts allow users to adjust a brush that updates the detail view displayed below. The linear area chart uses colored bands representing different samples and displays genomic intervals on the x-axis and peak expressions on the y-axis. The circular line chart similarly stratifies data into rows by samples and colors lines according to the sample category. The bottom section is a detailed scatter plot focusing on chromosome 1 from 160,000,000 to 200,000,000, depicting point data for peak expression and sample categories using distinct colors. This visualization utilizes interactive brushing for dynamic range updates, providing an in-depth exploration of genomic patterns across multiple samples.
