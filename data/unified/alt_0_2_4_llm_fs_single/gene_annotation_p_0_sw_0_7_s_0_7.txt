This visualization presents six genomic range annotation tracks with linear layouts displaying data for chromosome 3 from positions 52,168,000 to 52,890,000. Each track integrates various annotations and visual encodings.

1. **IGV Track**:
   - Title: "IGV."
   - Blue rectangles and text represent gene annotations, stratified by strand.
   - Navy color encodes positive strand genes; white lines with triangle patterns indicate gene directionality.

2. **Corces et al. Track**:
   - Title: "Corces et al."
   - Red and blue rectangles indicate strands, with text annotations for gene names.
   - Exons are shown in thicker bars, differentiated from the gene body by height.

3. **HiGlass Track**:
   - Title: "HiGlass."
   - Positively-stranded genes are blue, while negatively-stranded ones are red.
   - Triangles mark gene boundaries with directions; exons are boxed in colored rectangles.

4. **Cyverse-QUBES Track**:
   - Title: "Cyverse-QUBES."
   - Features black text for gene labels and light gray rectangles for gene bodies.
   - Purple elements highlight exons, providing distinction with strokes.

5. **GmGDV Track**:
   - Title: "GmGDV."
   - Blue right-facing triangles denote positive strands, red left-facing for negative.
   - Shows exon details in rectangles and directional arrows on
