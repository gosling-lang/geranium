The visualization is a linear bar chart titled "Basic Marks: bar" with a subtitle "Tutorial Examples." It displays genomic data using a multivec file for the entire genome of hg38. The x-axis represents genomic positions in intervals, and the y-axis shows quantitative expression values, depicted by the height of the sky-blue bars. The data is aggregated by a bin size of 5, highlighting expression peaks for a category identified as "sample 1." The chart has a width of 800 pixels and a height of 180 pixels.
