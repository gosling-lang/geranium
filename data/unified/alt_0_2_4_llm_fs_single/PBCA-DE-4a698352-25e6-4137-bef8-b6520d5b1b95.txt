The visualization consists of a circular view and a linear view arranged vertically. The circular view represents the entire genome of hg19 with a brush tool linking to the linear view, which focuses on chromosome 1. 

The circular view includes five tracks: 

1. A circular ideogram displays chromosome bands and a brush tool for zooming into specific genomic regions.
2. A text annotation track, titled "Putative Driver," highlights gene names with prefix symbols indicating biallelic status.
3. A range annotation track titled "Gain" represents genomic gain regions with sky-blue rectangles.
4. Another range annotation track titled "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" displays genomic loss regions with orange rectangles.
5. A connection track shows structural variations between genomic positions, with lines colored and stroked based on structural variation type, including "Translocation," "Duplication," "Deletion," and inversions.

The linear view replicates the circular view's structure for chromosome 1, and includes additional tracks:

1. A gene annotation track visualizes gene structures with exons and labels.
2. A scatter plot titled "Point Mutation" shows mutation distances, with point colors reflecting different mutation subtypes like "C>A" or "T>G."
3. A range annotation track for Insertions and Deletions with yellow and green bars, respectively.
4. A copy number variation track visualizes quantitative variations as gray bars.

Each track is enriched with tooltips providing detailed information about genomic
