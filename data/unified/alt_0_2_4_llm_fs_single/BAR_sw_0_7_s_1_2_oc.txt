The visualization is a linear bar chart that represents genomic data across various chromosomes using a multivec format. The chart is titled "Basic Marks: bar" with a subtitle "Tutorial Examples." It spans a width of 672 pixels and a height of 246 pixels, showing genome intervals on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis. The genomic positions are binned in intervals of 5. The data is presented as bars, with each bar's height representing the expression level. The Y-axis is positioned on the right, with no specific color encoding applied to the bars. The overall layout is static and aligned in a horizontal orientation, derived from hg38 assembly data.
