The visualization displays coverage and pileup tracks in a linear layout utilizing BAM data, focusing on chromosome 1 between positions 136,750 and 139,450. The top track is a bar chart showing the number of reads aligned in the specified regions, with bar height representing coverage. The bars are colored pink. The bottom track, using rectangles, displays individual reads with various structural variations such as normal reads, deletions, inversions, duplications, and more. Each variation type is colored differently, as denoted in the accompanying legend. The visualization is titled "Pileup Track Using BAM Data," and the subplot is "Insert Size = 300bp."
