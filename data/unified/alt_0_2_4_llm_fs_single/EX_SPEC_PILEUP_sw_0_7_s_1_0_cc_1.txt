The visualization comprises two tracks representing genome data from a BAM file in a linear layout. Both tracks span chromosome 1 between positions 136,750 and 139,450. The top track is a coverage bar chart, where the height of the bars indicates the coverage or the number of sequence reads at each position, colored in silver. The bottom track is a pileup chart showing individual read alignments as colored rectangles. Each color represents a different type of structural variation, including normal reads, deletions, inversions, duplications, and reads with multiple mates. This track is stratified by rows to accommodate the pileup of reads. The visualization includes an interactive tooltip providing detailed information about genomic positions, insert size, structural variation type, strand, and mate information. The title is "Pileup Track Using BAM Data," with annotations in sky blue and purple.
