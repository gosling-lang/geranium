A circular scatter plot visualizes genomic data from a multivec file across chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500. The plot is divided into four rows, each representing a different sample: 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4.' Data points are displayed according to their genomic position on the x-axis, with corresponding expression values on the y and size axes. Each sample is represented by a distinct color, and the opacity of points is set to 0.5 for a semi-transparent effect. The chart includes a legend indicating the sample colors.
