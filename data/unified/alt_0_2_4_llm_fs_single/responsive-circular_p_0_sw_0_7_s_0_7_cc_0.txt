A circular multicolored bar chart visualizes a multivec file across chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. It displays data categorized into samples stratified by rows, each represented with distinctive colors. The bars extend radially, encoding quantitative measurements labeled as 'peak.' The visualization is adaptive, with responsive specifications altering the layout based on the aspect ratio. This visualization refers to a study by Javed et al., highlighting graphical perception in multiple time series. The chart maintains responsiveness in height adjustments, ensuring a clear depiction of multivariate data through predefined categorical color schemes.
