A circular bar chart visualizes genomic data from a multivec file, highlighting chromosome 12 between positions 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. The chart displays multiple categories, specifically 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', 'sample 6', 'sample 7', and 'sample 8', with each category represented by distinct colors, including blue, orange, and purple. The bars indicate the expression values on the y-axis, stratified by rows for each category. The layout is non-static, allowing zoom interactions, and maintains a center radius of 0.3. Data transformation includes filtering out 'sample -', ensuring clarity of displayed results.
