The circular visualization consists of two tracks side by side. The left track is a circular bar chart displaying genomic data from chromosome 1, ranging from positions 1 to 3,000,500. The genomic positions are on the x-axis, and expression values are represented by the y-axis. Bars are colored according to four different categories: sample 1 in blue, sample 2 in orange, sample 3 in green, and sample 4 in red. The right track is an overlay of a circular line chart and a scatter plot. Both charts share the same x-axis for genomic positions, while the y-axis shows expression values. Lines and points are colored according to the same four categories as the bar chart. Additionally, point sizes vary based on expression values. The visualization is set in a circular layout using the hg38 assembly, with separate legends for each category.
