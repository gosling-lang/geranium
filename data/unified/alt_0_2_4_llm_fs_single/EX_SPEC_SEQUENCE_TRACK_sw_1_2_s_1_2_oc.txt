A vertical arrangement with a linear overlay layout visualizes a sequence multivec file, depicting chromosome 1 between positions 3,000,000 and 3,000,010. The visualization features a bar chart and text representation along a shared axis. The bars utilize different colors to distinguish bases: A, T, G, and C, with corresponding counts shown on the y-axis. Text annotations are overlaid on non-zero count positions, displaying the base in white with bold styling to enhance visibility. The chart is interactive, facilitating zoom operations for finer resolution under the threshold of 40 zoom levels.
