A circular scatter plot visualizes genomic data using a multivec file for chromosome 1, spanning positions 1 to 3,000,500, in a vertical arrangement. The visualization features points that represent expression values, structured in rows for four samples: 'sample 1,' 'sample 2,' 'sample 3,' and 'sample 4.' Each sample is distinguished by color: yellow, green, blue, and purple. The points' size and color vary according to the 'peak' values and sample categories, respectively. The chart includes an opacity setting of 0.5 and a legend for sample categories.clearer overlap view. The plot includes tooltips that display the start and end genomic positions and the expression values for each sample.
