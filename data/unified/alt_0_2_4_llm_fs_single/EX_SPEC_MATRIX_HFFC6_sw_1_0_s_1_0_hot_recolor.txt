This visualization, titled "Matrix Visualization" with the subtitle "Comparison of Micro-C and Hi-C for HFFc6 Cells," features a horizontal layout depicting chromosome 7 from positions 77,700,000 to 81,000,000. The structure includes two main vertically arranged views. Each view is composed of multiple tracks.

The left view consists of vertical bar charts:
1. "HFFc6_H3K4me3" marked in purple.
2. "HFFc6_ATAC" marked in dark green.
3. "HFFC6_CTCF" contains orange bars with pink and green triangles indicating strand directions. These bars utilize data from bigWig files.

This view is linked to the right view, demonstrating two matrix-based heatmaps and additional tracks:
1. A "Micro-C" matrix where data intensity is represented using a hot color scale.
2. An "Epilogos (hg38)" chart visualizing several chromatin states, using colors ranging from red and green to yellow and gray for different categories such as "Active TSS" and "Bivalent Enhancer."

The right view mirrors this structure but focuses on Hi-C data instead of Micro-C.

Overall, the diagram effectively shows correlations between genomic modifications and structural variations across the specified region of chromosome 7.
