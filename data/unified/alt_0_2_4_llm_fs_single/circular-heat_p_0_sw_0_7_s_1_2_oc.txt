The visualization is a circular heatmap titled "Visual Encoding in Circular Layouts" with the subtitle "Heatmap." It displays genomic data from chromosome 1 within the interval of 1 to 3,000,500. The heatmap is arranged vertically and stratified into rows representing categories labeled as 'sample 1' through 'sample 4.' The color intensity encodes the expression values, with darker hues indicating higher values. An interactive legend is present, providing value scales corresponding to the color intensities. The layout features a circular arrangement with a center radius of 0.5. The data points are represented as rectangles, using a multivec file as input data. The visualization is static, with a horizontal orientation, and provides tooltips with genomic start and end positions, expression values, and sample information for interactively exploring the dataset.
