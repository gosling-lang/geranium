The visualization consists of two tracks arranged vertically in a linear layout, covering chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500 of the hg38 assembly. The top track is a scatter plot where genomic positions are plotted on the x-axis, and expression values (labeled as "peak") are on the y-axis. Each point represents a sample from one of four categories, indicated by different colors. The bottom track is an overlay consisting of a bar chart and an area chart. It shows the same genomic intervals on the x-axis, with qualitative values on the y-axis, represented by bars and shaded areas. The track is stratified by rows based on the sample categories, also indicated by color. Both tracks provide tooltips displaying genomic positions and values for detailed data exploration.
