A visualization with a circular view and a linear view is presented. The views are linked by a blue interactive brush in the circular view, which displays the entire genome. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1. The circular view includes an ideogram, point annotation track, two range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)' with blue and orange rectangles, respectively, and a line-connection track. The line-connection track differentiates categories such as 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' 'Deletion,' and 'Inversion' based on the 'svclass' data field. The linear view mirrors these tracks and adds a gene annotation track, a scatterplot titled 'Point Mutation,' and range annotation tracks. The scatterplot uses a VCF file, with distance to the previous mutation represented as point positions, colored by 'SUBTYPE.' Another range annotation track displays VCF data with insertion and deletion rows in yellow and green. Finally, the 'Copy Number Variants' track shows bars representing the 'total_cn' data field, colored light gray.
