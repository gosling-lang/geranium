The visualization consists of eight individual charts: two genomic range annotation tracks and six bar charts. The genomic range annotation tracks display gene information with text, right and left triangles, and rectangles, organized by strands in purple and green. The bar charts, representing "Sample 1", "Sample 2", and "Sample 3", visualize quantitative genomic data for specific regions on chromosomes 12 and 8. Each bar chart uses distinct colors: sky blue, pink, purple, and green, to show expression levels. Intervals along the x-axis signify genomic positions, and y-axis coordinates indicate expression values.
