The visualization is a multi-layered area chart arranged vertically in a linear layout, showcasing genomic data from chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. It displays four distinct samples (1, 2, 3, and 4) encoded by different colors: blue, orange, green, and red. Each sample is plotted as an area mark, with the x-axis representing genomic positions and the y-axis showing peak values. Categories are distinguished by color, and detailed information is provided via tooltips that reveal the start and end positions, peak values, and sample identifiers.
