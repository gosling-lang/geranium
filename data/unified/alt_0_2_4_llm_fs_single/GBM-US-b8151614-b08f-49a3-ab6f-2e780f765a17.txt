The visualization consists of a circular and linear view, linked by a blue interactive brush in the circular view. The circular view displays the entire genome using a circular ideogram and four tracks, including a point annotation track and range annotation tracks titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH).' Genomic ranges are represented with blue and orange rectangles respectively. A line-connection track highlights structural variations with categories like 'Translocation,' 'Duplication,' and 'Inversion,' denoting connections between genomic positions in various colors.

The linear view, aligned with chromosome 1, features an ideogram track, a scatter plot titled 'Point Mutation' depicting variant types (C>A, C>G, etc.) with color-coded points, and a genomic range annotation track showing 'Insertion' and 'Deletion' in separate rows. Another track labeled 'Copy Number Variants' visualizes quantitative data with grey rectangles. Each component offers detailed insights into genomic rearrangements and mutations, aiding comprehensive genomic analysis.
