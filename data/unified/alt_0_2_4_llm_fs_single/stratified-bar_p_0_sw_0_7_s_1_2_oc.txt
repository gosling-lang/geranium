A multi-row bar chart in a linear layout visualizes a multivec file, showing chromosome 1 from position 1 to 3,000,500. The chart is composed of four rows, each representing 'sample 1', 'sample 2', 'sample 3', and 'sample 4'. Each row displays genomic data as bars where their height corresponds to quantitative peak values. The bars are colored distinctively for each sample, with a legend indicating these colors. The axis is labeled with genomic positions, and tooltips provide additional data details such as start and end positions, peak values, and sample names.
