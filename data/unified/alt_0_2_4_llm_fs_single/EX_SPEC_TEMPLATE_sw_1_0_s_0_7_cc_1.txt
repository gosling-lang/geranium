A visualization in a linear layout displays genomic data using track templates in Gosling.js. The title is "Track Template In Gosling.js" with the subtitle "Gosling.js enables track templates! This allows to create complex visualization more easily." The first track represents genomic range annotations on chromosome 3 between positions 52,168,000 and 52,890,000. It uses a gene annotation template, showing genes in gray with text labels and strand orientations. The second track illustrates a bar chart representing sequence data for chromosome 1 between positions 77,925,299 and 77,925,320, depicting bases A, T, G, and C in various colors. The third track is an ideogram for chromosome 1, visualizing cytogenetic bands using colored rectangles and indicating centromeric regions with triangles. This visualization leverages track templates for efficient complex genomic data representation.
