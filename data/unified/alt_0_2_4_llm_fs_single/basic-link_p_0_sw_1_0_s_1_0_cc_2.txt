A linear layout visualization titled 'Basic Marks: Link', with the subtitle 'Tutorial Examples', depicts arbitrary connections on chromosome 1 of the hg38 assembly. The data is sourced from a CSV file. Link marks represent genomic intervals on the x-axis from two different regions, colored in green. The chart provides a visual encoding of genomic field connections with the specified gene positions and intervals.
