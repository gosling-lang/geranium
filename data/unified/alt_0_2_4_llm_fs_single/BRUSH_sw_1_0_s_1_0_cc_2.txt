A linear layout visualization featuring two line charts demonstrates genomic data for chromosome 1 sourced from a multivec file. The top chart, colored purple, presents the full chromosome with expression values plotted on the y-axis. It incorporates a steel blue brush tool, enabling interaction and linking to the lower chart. The bottom chart is a focused view in green, showcasing a specific genomic interval from 200,000,000 to 220,000,000 on the x-axis. This chart emphasizes detailed trends within the selected interval, maintaining consistency with the interactive brush feature above. The layout is adorned with the title "Example: Brushing and Linking," emphasizing dynamic data exploration.
