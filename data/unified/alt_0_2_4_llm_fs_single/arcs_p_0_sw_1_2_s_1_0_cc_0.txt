A linear arc visualization depicts genomic data from chromosome 1 between base pairs 1 and 3,000,500, concentrated on intervals between 103,900,000 and 104,100,000. The arcs are colored based on start positions, providing a nominal categorization. The arcs have a black stroke and a low opacity, allowing for overlap visualization. The dataset is sourced from a CSV file with genomic coordinate fields. The title is "Visual Encoding" and the subtitle is "Arcs".
