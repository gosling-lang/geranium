The visualization shows a linear ideogram representing the human genome (hg38). It highlights chromosomes using alternating shades of gray. Semantic zooming is employed, allowing for text and triangle marks to become visible upon zooming in, which adds detail. The rectangles indicate different chromosome categories with various colors for specific stains. Red triangles mark specific regions. The chart is titled "Example: Semantic Zooming" and includes a subtitle that explains the zooming functionality. The source data is a CSV file from a public repository.
