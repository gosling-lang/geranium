A two-track linear visualization demonstrates a comparison of genomic data alignment methods titled "Smoother Zoom." The top track, "New Approach: Stretching Tiles," presents genomic sequences as colored rectangles representing different categories, with text annotations overlaid, all scaling with zoom. The bottom track, "Original Approach," follows a similar format with the same data source, focusing on the conventional method of displaying elements. Each track uses a color-coded legend to indicate nucleotide bases, offering a visual stratification by sample name. The x-axis covers the genomic interval from position 350 to 396.
