A circular layout visualization includes two contrasting tracks. The left track displays an area chart stratified by rows representing categories such as 'sample 1' to 'sample 4'. Each sample is visualized with distinct colors. This track shows the genomic positions on the x-axis and quantitative peak values on the y-axis, covering chromosome 1 from 1 to 3,000,500. The right track displays connections within the same circular layout, representing genomic intervals on the x-axis, with connections color-coded according to various categories. The visualization utilizes a multivec file and a CSV file to illustrate different genomic and categorical attributes.
