The visualization is a linear layout bar chart illustrating genomic data from a multivec file, targeting the entire genome in the hg38 assembly. Each bar represents quantitative peak values for 'sample 1,' encoded along the y-axis with a fixed size. The bars, colored in light purple, extend across the genomic intervals on the x-axis. The title reads “Basic Marks: bar” with a subtitle “Tutorial Examples.” The total width and height assigned to the visualization are 960 and 246, respectively.
