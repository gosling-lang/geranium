The visualization is a circular layout titled "Between Links in Circular Layouts with Parallel Arrangements." It consists of stacked tracks representing genomic data. The outer circular bar chart shows genomic intervals on the x-axis and expression values on the y-axis, with sky blue bars. Two ideograms display chromosome bands, with categories highlighted in varied colors. The innermost track has dark lines connecting genomic positions, indicating relationships. Colors in the ideograms are based on specified categorical domains, enhancing visual distinction. The static design maintains consistent radial spacing with a center radius of 0.3.
