A circular visualization displays genomic data using four tracks. The outermost track is a colorful ideogram representing different chromosomal bands of the hg38 assembly with categories like 'gneg', 'gpos25', and others, each assigned specific colors. The next two tracks visualize copy number variation (CNV) data from a cancer dataset. The first CNV track shows genomic ranges in purple rectangles where the 'minor copy number tumor' is zero, while the second uses green rectangles for 'total copy number tumor' values between 4.5 and 900. Within the innermost track, a set of lines represents genomic rearrangements categorized as 'tandem-duplication', 'translocation', 'deletion', and 'inversion', indicated by unique colors and strokes. The chart is interactive, showing genomic intervals on the x-axis and utilizing opacity and stroke width for visual clarity.
