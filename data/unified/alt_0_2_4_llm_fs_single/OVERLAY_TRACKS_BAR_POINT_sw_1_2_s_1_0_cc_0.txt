The linear visualization "Example: Overlay Tracks" shows genomic data from chromosome 3. It consists of overlay tracks featuring bars and points, representing the clinical significance of genomic variants. The color encoding differentiates categories: pathogenic, likely benign, and others, with colors like orange for pathogenic variants and green for benign ones. The genomic range is depicted on the x-axis with significance categories on the y-axis, forming a comprehensive view of variant impacts across this chromosome.
