A circular visualization titled 'Circos' displays genomic data using three integrated tracks: a bar chart, an ideogram, and a connection chart. The outermost track, a circular bar chart, represents genomic positions with bar heights encoding quantitative 'peak' values in a silver color. Next, the ideogram shows genomic intervals with categorical color-coding for different chromosome bands. The innermost track is a connection chart that depicts genomic links between different positions using colored lines, with colors representing various chromosome connections. The visualization uses data from hg38 assembly, arranged in a stack alignment with a center radius of 0.3, and allows comparing structural variations across the entire genome.
