A linear layout presents four vertical tracks, each visualizing BED files on chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 2,000,000. The first track, titled 'BED12: All 12 standard fields,' uses purple rectangles to display standard BED fields. The second track, 'BED6: A file with the first 6 BED fields,' uses pink rectangles for the initial BED fields. The third track, 'BED6+6: A file with the first 6 BED fields, and 6 custom fields,' also employs purple rectangles to portray additional custom fields starting at column 7. Lastly, the 'BED12+1: A file with all 12 standard fields, and a single extra custom field,' uses pink rectangles to represent an additional custom field from the 13th column. Each rectangular mark is uniformly sized and bordered in black.
