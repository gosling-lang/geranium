The visualization is an overlay of two matrix tracks, displaying genomic data for chromosome 10 in a triangular layout. The x- and y-axes represent genomic intervals, allowing for genomic comparisons. The lower-left matrix uses a hot color scale, indicating quantitative values in shades of orange. The upper-right matrix uses a grey color scale, encoding similar quantitative data. Both matrices include color legends for interpreting the intensity of expression values. Intervals on the genomic axes contribute to understanding genomic relationships and comparisons within the data.
