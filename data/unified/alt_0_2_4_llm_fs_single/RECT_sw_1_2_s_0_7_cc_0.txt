A linear ideogram displays genomic intervals on chromosome 1 using a dataset from the UCSC HG38 CytoBand. The "Basic Marks: Rect" visualization utilizes colored rectangles to represent various categories, such as "gneg", "gpos25," and others. Colors include blue, orange, green, and red. Each rectangle's position is determined by genomic start and end fields. The title is "Basic Marks: Rect," and the layout is horizontal.
