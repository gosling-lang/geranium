The visualization depicts an overlaid matrix representation of chromosome 10, featuring two genomic interaction matrices in a linear layout. The first track presents a grayscale matrix focusing on the lower-left region, while the second track highlights an upper-right matrix using a pink color scheme. Each matrix visualizes expression values encoded by intensity, with genomic intervals displayed on both axes. The visualization is interactive, allowing responsive adjustments based on screen width, and includes legends for quantitative expression values. The arrangement facilitates comparative genomic analysis, emphasizing regions of interest through color and intensity contrasts.
