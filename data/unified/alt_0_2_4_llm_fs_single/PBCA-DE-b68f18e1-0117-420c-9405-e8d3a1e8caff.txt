The visualization consists of a vertically arranged linear and circular view, linked by an interactive brush. The circular view represents the entire genome, displaying tracks like an ideogram, genomic ranges with annotated points and connections, and structural variations (Translocation, Duplication, etc.), shown in distinct colors. The linear view focuses on chromosome 1, including tracks for gene annotations, point mutations (colored by subtype), and copy number variants. Notable tracks are titled 'Gain' and 'Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),' each displaying distinct genomic ranges. The visualization interlinks circular and linear perspectives, enhancing genomic data interaction and exploration.
