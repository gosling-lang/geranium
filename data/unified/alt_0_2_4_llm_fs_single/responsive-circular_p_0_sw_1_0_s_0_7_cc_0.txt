A circular bar chart visualizes multivector data across chromosome 12 from position 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. This visualization stratifies data points into 16 categories represented by concentric bars in distinct colors. The categories include ‘sample 1’ to ‘sample 16,’ excluding ‘sample -’. Each category is visually differentiated by colors such as blue, orange, green, and more, using a palette of specified hex codes. The chart adapts its layout responsively between circular and linear based on the aspect ratio. The expression values are encoded on the y-axis with variable opacity depending on the visibility criteria related to track height, while genomic positions map to the x-axis. This visualization references a study by Javed et al. on the graphical perception of multiple time series.
