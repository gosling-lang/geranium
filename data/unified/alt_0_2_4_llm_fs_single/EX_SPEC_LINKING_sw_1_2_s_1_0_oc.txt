The visualization titled "Visual Linking" consists of two interconnected views: a circular bar chart and a linear bar chart. The circular chart displays genomic data for chromosome 1, using bar heights to represent quantitative peaks across four sample categories. The categories are distinguished by different colors. A brush interaction is included, allowing users to select specific genomic intervals, which are mirrored in the linear view below. The linear chart offers a detailed view of the selected range, focused on a specified interval between 160,000,000 and 200,000,000 base pairs on chromosome 1. Here, the genomic data is displayed with similar bar encoding, facilitating detailed comparison and exploration.
