The visualization features a circular view and a linear view for genomic data analysis. The circular layout displays multiple tracks including an ideogram, and tracks titled "Gain" and "Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)" annotated with blue and orange rectangles, respectively. A line-connection track shows connections between genomic positions, with lines styled based on categories like 'Translocation', 'Duplication', and 'Inversion'. The linear view consists of an ideogram and various annotation tracks, including point mutations and copy number variants (CNVs). Each track is accompanied by a legend, facilitating analysis of chromosome 1 in detail. The views are linked via an interactive brush on the ideogram, allowing users to explore genomic intervals effectively.
