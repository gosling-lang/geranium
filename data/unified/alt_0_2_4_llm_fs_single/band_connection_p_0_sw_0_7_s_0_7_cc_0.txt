A linear layout visualization of segmental duplications on chromosome 1, specifically between positions 103,900,000 and 104,100,000, using a CSV file. The visualization consists of multiple tracks featuring rectangles and connections. The rectangles indicate genomic positions, colored in sky blue, pink, and purple. The connections link two genomic regions with matching chromosomes, reflecting potential duplications. Colors for these links also include sky blue, pink, and purple, each with a unique opacity level. This setup highlights complex genomic relationships within the specified interval.
