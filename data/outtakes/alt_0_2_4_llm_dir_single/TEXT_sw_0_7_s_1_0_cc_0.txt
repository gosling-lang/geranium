The visualization is a text chart in a linear layout titled "Basic Marks: Text," with the subtitle "Tutorial Examples." It represents genomic data from the hg38 assembly using a multivec dataset. The x-axis displays genomic intervals across several chromosomes like chr1, chr4, chr12, and more. The y-axis quantifies nucleotide expression, encoded as text. Nucleotides A, T, G, and C are colored blue, orange, green, and red, respectively. Each letter's position and size are based on a quantitative field named 'count.' The layout features a width of 560 and a height of 180, allowing for stretching to accommodate data. TextStrokeWidth is set to zero, and the style prioritizes categorical coloring for easy differentiation between nucleotides.
