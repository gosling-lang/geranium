The visualization is a circular bar chart displaying genomic data. It represents chromosome 12, covering an interval from 5,000,000 to 15,000,000. The expression levels, derived from multivec data, are encoded on the y-axis using bar length. Different samples, identified as categories, are displayed in concentric circular rows, with distinct colors representing each sample, such as 'sample 1', 'sample 2', and others, excluding 'sample -'. The x-axis denotes genomic intervals, and the chart adjusts its size responsively with a fixed width while allowing height adaptation. The opacity and visibility of bars are dynamically controlled based on the track height. The visualization effectively stratifies genomic expression data into rows corresponding to various samples, providing a visually comprehensive overview of expression patterns across the specified genomic region.
