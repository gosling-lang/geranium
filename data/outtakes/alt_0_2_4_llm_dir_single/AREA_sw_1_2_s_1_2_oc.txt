The visualization is a linear area chart titled "Basic Marks: area" with a subtitle "Tutorial Examples." It uses a multivec file to display genomic data from the entire hg38 genome assembly. The x-axis represents genomic positions across various chromosomes labeled chr1 to chrX, while the y-axis represents quantitative peaks of expression levels. The data focuses on a single category, "sample 1," highlighted in orange. The chart is 1152 units wide and 216 units high, emphasizing the variation of peak intensities across the genome. The data is sourced from an online URL.
