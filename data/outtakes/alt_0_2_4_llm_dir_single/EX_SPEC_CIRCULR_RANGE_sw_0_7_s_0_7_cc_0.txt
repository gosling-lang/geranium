A circular bar chart in a stacked alignment visualizes a genomic dataset. The chart displays data across the entire genome, encoded in the circular x-axis, with expression values represented as pink bars on the y-axis. The visualization has a center radius of 0.3 and is designed in a static, circular layout. The bars are mapped to the 'peak' data field, providing quantitative expressions from a vector data source.
