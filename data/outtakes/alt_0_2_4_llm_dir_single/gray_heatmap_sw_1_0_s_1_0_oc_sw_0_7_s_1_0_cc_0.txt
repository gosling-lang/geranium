A heatmap in a linear layout visualizes a genomic matrix from the hg38 assembly. The x-axis shows genomic intervals from the entire genome, and the y-axis does the same, providing a chromosomal overview. Color intensity represents quantitative expression values, with a 'hot' color range indicating varying levels of expression. The plot is static, with predefined dimensions and no interactive elements.
