The visualization titled "Gremlin (O'Brien et al. 2010)" consists of two main sections in a linear layout. The top section features a detailed ideogram of Chromosome 5, highlighting genomic intervals with categories such as 'gneg', 'gpos', and 'gvar', indicated by different shades of gray and black. Categories are also labeled with their names in sky blue text. Beneath this is an overlay track showing duplicated segments connecting genomic positions within Chromosome 5 and between adjacent chromosomes 4 and 6, visualized with colored strokes in shades of blue, orange, and green. 

The lower sections include two linked views. The "Region of Interest" focus area shows detailed segment duplications within a specified range on Chromosome 5 between 68,000,000 and 71,000,000 bases, using strokes in similar colors. The "Rearrangement View" further zooms in to show specific connections between 69,276,000 and 69,280,000 bases on the chromosome, displayed as transparent blue links. These interconnected visualizations enhance understanding of genomic rearrangements by interlinking detailed and broad views through a system of brushes and linking IDs.
