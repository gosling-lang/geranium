A linear layout visualizes multivec data along chromosome 1 between positions 1 and 3,000,500. The first track is a scatter plot where points represent peaks with varying sizes and colors based on the sample category. Points are semi-transparent and show genomic data on the x-axis and quantitative values on the y-axis, with colors indicating four different samples: blue, orange, green, and red. The second track is an area chart stratified by sample categories, displaying peaks as colored areas. The layout includes interactive elements and positions for genomic intervals, enhancing data comprehension.
