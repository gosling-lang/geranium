The visualization is a circular multivariate bar chart that showcases a multivec file focusing on chromosome 12 between 5,000,000 and 15,000,000. It uses a circular layout where each bar's height represents the 'peak' value, categorized by different samples. Each sample is assigned a unique color to distinguish them. The chart adapts responsively, switching to a linear layout when the aspect ratio is above 1.5. The description references "Graphical perception of Multiple Time Series" by Javed et al. from TVCG 2010.
