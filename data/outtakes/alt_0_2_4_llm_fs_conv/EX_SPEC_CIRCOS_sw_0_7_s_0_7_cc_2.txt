A circular layout visualization titled "Circos" displays genomic data. The chart includes three main components: a circular bar chart, an ideogram, and a connection chart. The bar chart shows genomic positions on the x-axis and peaks on the y-axis, with bars colored in purple. The ideogram displays genomic intervals in various colored rectangles, indicating different categories. The connection chart illustrates genomic intervals with colorful links, visualizing data from a vector file. The chart's central theme revolves around showcasing relationships and variations across different chromosomes.
