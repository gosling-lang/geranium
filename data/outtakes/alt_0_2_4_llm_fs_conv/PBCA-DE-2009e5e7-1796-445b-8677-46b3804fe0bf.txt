A circular and a linear view are arranged vertically. The circular view displays the entire genome with chromosome bands in an ideogram, annotated with text tracks for putative drivers. It has multiple rings depicting gains, losses, and structural variations with connections. Colors represent different categories. The linear view, linked by a blue brush, focuses on chromosome 1, with multiple tracks showing similar annotations, point mutations colored by subtype, gene annotations, and copy number variants. The layout is generated using hg19 assembly data.
